The power, flexibility, and reliability of FreeBSD attract a wide
variety of users and vendors. Below is a list of vendors offering
commercial products, services, and/or consulting for FreeBSD.

-   Consulting Services Whether you are just starting out with FreeBSD,
    or need to complete a large project, hiring consultants might be
    your answer. You can see the alphabetical list, or, if you prefer,
    view it by categories.

-   Hardware Vendors Need specialized tools, looking to buy a new
    desktop, or to fill a cage with rack mount servers that come with
    FreeBSD pre-installed? These companies may have what you need!

-   Internet Service Providers If you need webspace on a FreeBSD-based
    system or want your company connected to the internet, these
    companies may offer what you need!

-   Miscellaneous Vendors Books and accessories you just cannot live
    without!

-   Software Vendors Vendors From audio players, network drivers, to
    commercial databases, FreeBSD has a wide variety of industrial
    strength software available. You can see the alphabetical list, or,
    if you prefer, view it by categories.

If your company supports a FreeBSD related product, service, consulting,
or support that should be added to this page, please fill out a problem
report in category Documentation→Website. Submissions should contain a
medium-sized paragraph in length, describing your company. Please note
that the inclusion of vendors in our list does not signify our
endorsement of their products or services by the FreeBSD Project.
