Daylight Savings Time Changes for 2007

This is a summary of the information about the change in Daylight
Savings Time rules and how the change affects FreeBSD releases.

In 2005 several countries, including the United States of America and
Canada, passed legislation changing when Daylight Savings Time begins
and ends. That change takes effect in 2007. For the time zones affected
by the change Daylight Savings Time will begin on March 11th (instead of
April 1st) and end on November 4th (instead of October 28th).

FreeBSD uses /etc/localtime to control the conversion of the system’s
internal representation of time (based on UTC) to the format appropriate
for the local time zone. That file gets copied from one of the files in
/usr/share/zoneinfo by the tzsetup(8) command, usually as part of the
initial installation procedure. The change in Daylight Savings Time
rules affects the files in /usr/share/zoneinfo for the time zones
affected by the legislation passed in 2005.

Of the release branches supported by the FreeBSD Security Team as of
February 2007, FreeBSD-6.2 and FreeBSD-5.5 have up to date zoneinfo
files. FreeBSD-6.1 has correct zoneinfo files for time zones in the
United States of America but out of date zoneinfo files for some of the
other countries affected (for example Canada). An Errata Notice will be
released shortly to update the zoneinfo files in FreeBSD-6.1.

For the development branches HEAD, RELENG_6, RELENG_5, and RELENG_4 all
have the correct zoneinfo files in them.

| Note                              | /etc/localtime currently does not |
|                                   | get updated when the              |

|                                   | update procedures are used. If a  |

|                                   | of the releases not listed above  |
|                                   | it will probably have an outdated |
|                                   | /etc/localtime file. That file    |
|                                   | can be updated by running         |
|                                   | tzsetup(8).                       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

For older systems no longer under support the misc/zoneinfo port can be
installed to update the /usr/share/zoneinfo files, followed by running
tzsetup(8) to update /etc/localtime.
