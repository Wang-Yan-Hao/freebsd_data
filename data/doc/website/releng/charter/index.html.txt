Charter for the Release Engineering Team

The Release Engineering Team has the following responsibilities:

-   Setting and publishing the release schedule for Official Project
    releases of FreeBSD.

-   Documenting and formalizing the RE procedures, so that the process
    can continually be reviewed and improved. This includes more
    documentation about the ports cluster and package split procedures.

-   Setting and publishing "Code Freeze" dates, and acting as a
    change-review committee to decide which changes may be made to a
    branch during a code freeze. This includes freezes for HEAD when
    approaching a .0 release as well as the traditional releng/* code
    freeze pending a -STABLE release.

-   Creation and maintenance of releng/* branches of the src/ tree. This
    includes final authority over what commits are made (and remain in)
    the -STABLE branch prior to the branching of a release branch.

-   Working with core and/or the FreeBSD Foundation to codify a set of
    guidelines that vendors must meet if they are to be allowed to call
    a product "FreeBSD", or an "Official FreeBSD release".

-   Testing and integrating required packages from the ports collection
    onto the official project release media. Portmgr@ is responsible for
    managing the ports/ code freeze and providing a complete package
    build of the re-distributable ports. re@ is then responsible for
    splitting those packages onto different ISOs as required by the
    release media. re@ is ultimately responsible for ensuring that all
    of the required packages are available on the FreeBSD release media,
    but portmgr@ cooperation is essential.

-   Coordinating with the FreeBSD Documentation Project, to ensure that
    a consistent set of documentation is provided for the release. This
    includes the ability to request that large disruptive changes not be
    made to the documentation set in the weeks leading up to a release.

-   Coordinating with the security officer team to ensure that pending
    FreeBSD releases are not affected by recently disclosed
    vulnerabilities. Also, approximately 1 week after a release, change
    approval control of release branches (releng/X.Y/) is transferred
    from the release engineers to the security-officer team. The exact
    transfer date is to be worked out by the two parties once it is
    clear that the release was a success. A heads up message should be
    sent to developers@ at that time.

-   Sending out messages to announce@FreeBSD.org on behalf of the
    project to announce new releases of FreeBSD.
