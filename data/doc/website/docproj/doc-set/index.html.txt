FreeBSD Documentation Project: Documentation Set

FreeBSD’s documentation falls into three basic categories:

1.  The manual pages

    The manual pages are part of the base system, but are also an
    important component of the documentation. Both the Documentation
    project and source committers update and maintain manual pages.

    At present, the Japanese team has translated many of the manual
    pages. Other volunteers could pitch in to translate the manual pages
    to other languages as well.

2.  The Books

    The project has a large amount of documentation that is "book
    length", or becoming that way. These include the FreeBSD FAQ and the
    FreeBSD Handbook.

3.  The Articles

    FreeBSD has a wealth of information available in shorter, article
    form — similar to the tutorials or HOWTO documentation of other
    projects.
