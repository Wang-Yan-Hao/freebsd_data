FreeBSD Documentation Project

Overview

Getting to grips with a new and complex operating system is always a
difficult task, no matter how pretty the GUI is. FreeBSD is no different
in this respect.

While there are a vast number of BSD Unix (and general UNIX®) books
available, FreeBSD has its own unique features, procedures and quirks.

In addition, FreeBSD will be the first exposure to a Unix-like operating
system for some of its users, so the availability of high quality,
accurate documentation is paramount.

The FreeBSD Documentation Project exists to help fill this gap. There
are two ways in which this is undertaken:

1.  Members of the Documentation Project write documentation and submit
    it for inclusion in the FreeBSD Documentation Set.

2.  Members of the Documentation Project discuss and arrange the
    formatting and organization of the FreeBSD Documentation Set.

| There are a number of projects currently in progress as part of the   |
| documentation effort. Please take the time to look over the current   |
| list of projects and see if there is anything you can help with.      |

Submitting Documentation

Submitting documentation is the best way to become a part of the
project, and help make FreeBSD easier to use. This page explains the
best way to submit documentation so that it gets looked at as soon as
possible.
