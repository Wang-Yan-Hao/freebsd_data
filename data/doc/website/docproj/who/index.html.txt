FreeBSD Documentation Project: Who are we, how to join?

The project is a fairly loosely knit group of people, and the only thing
we have in common is that we are subscribed to the mailing list
FreeBSD-doc@FreeBSD.org.

Some of us can commit changes directly to the FreeBSD documentation
tree. There is a complete list of all FreeBSD developers with commit
privileges, as well as a list of the principal committers for the
FreeBSD Documentation Project.

Others do not have commit privileges, but write and submit documentation
nonetheless. Once the documentation has been submitted according to the
Submit Documentation page, one of the committers will then review it and
include it in the documentation set.

To help with the documentation project (and we fervently hope you do),
just subscribe to the mailing list and participate. As soon as you have
done that, you’re a member of the project.
