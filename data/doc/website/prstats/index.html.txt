Go fix/close a PR!

It’s easy, all you have to do is to follow this link to the Bugzilla
database, find a PR, figure out what needs done and do it.

If you are a committer, you can use the web interface to close PRs.

If you are not a committer, you should submit a followup containing the
text :

    This PR can be closed

on a line of its own, that will make it easier for a committer to deal
with it later.
