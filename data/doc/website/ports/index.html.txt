About FreeBSD Ports

Search ports for: All Package Name Description Long description
Maintainer Requires

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The FreeBSD ports and packages collections offer two simple ways for
users and administrators to install over 30,000 applications, utilities
or libraries.

For most of those, a precompiled package with default options exists for
each supported release, saving the user the work and time of having to
compile anything at all. Use pkg-install(8) to securely download and
install a package. For more information see Using pkg for Binary Package
Management.

Both collections support the latest point release on the FreeBSD-STABLE
branches. In addition, the ports collection supports the FreeBSD-CURRENT
branch. Older releases are not supported and may or may not work
correctly with an up-to-date ports collection. Over time, changes to the
ports collection may rely on features that are not present in older
releases. When this occurs, patches contributed by the user community to
maintain support for older releases will usually be committed.

Each port listed here contains any patches necessary to make the
original application source code compile and run on FreeBSD. If you
download the framework for the entire list of ports by installing the
ports hierarchy, you can have thousands of applications right at your
fingertips.

Each port’s Makefile automatically fetches the application source code,
either from a local disk or the network, unpacks it on your system,
applies the patches, and compiles. If all went well, a simple
make install will install the application and register it with the
package system.
