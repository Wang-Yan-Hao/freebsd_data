Searching FreeBSD Ports

Search ports for: All Package Name Description Long description
Maintainer Requires

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The form above will allow you to search for ports on this site. A
completed search will take you to a more complete search page.

However, if you already have the Ports Collection installed on your
machine, you may also search by changing to the /usr/ports directory and
performing make search name=`string. Instead of by `name you can search
by port path (path), port information (info), maintainer (maint), port
category (cat), build dependencies (bdeps), run dependencies (rdeps),
the project web site (www), or any of these fields (key). Use
make quicksearch …​ to only display the port name, port directory, and
one line description of the port.

Another option is to visit FreshPorts.org and either browse the site or
subscribe to the lists hosted there.
