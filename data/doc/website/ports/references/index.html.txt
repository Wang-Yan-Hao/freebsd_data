FreeBSD Ports -- References

Search ports for: All Package Name Description Long description

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To start learning more about ports and packages, see Installing
Applications: Packages and Ports, a section of the FreeBSD Handbook.

The Porter’s Handbook is the master reference for both creating new
ports and maintaining existing ports, including a section on Keeping Up.
It also contains more detail about the topics below, as well as more
references for further study.

You may also find the following to be useful:

-   The archives of the FreeBSD ports mailing list.

-   The article Contributing to the FreeBSD Ports Collection.

-   FreshPorts.org is a valuable tool for further information about
    individual ports, such as current version, last checkin, and many
    other useful statistics. You may subscribe to a mailing list to get
    the latest information about your favorite ports.

-   The manual pages for ftp(1), pkg(8), and ports(7).

-   The Ports Management Team (portmgr) pages.

-   The Web Interface to the Source Repository allows you to browse the
    files in the source repository. Changes that affect the entire port
    system are now documented in the CHANGES file. Changes that affect
    individual ports are now documented in the UPDATING file. However,
    the definitive answer to any question is undoubtedly to read the
    source code of bsd.port.mk, and associated files.
