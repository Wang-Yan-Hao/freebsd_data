Updating FreeBSD Ports

Search ports for: All Package Name Description Long description
Maintainer Requires

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ports listed on these web pages are continually being updated. It is
strongly recommended that you refresh the entire collection together, as
many ports depend on other parts of the tree, even where that might seem
counterintuitive (e.g. japanese/.)

Changes that affect the entire port system are now documented in the
CHANGES file. Changes that affect individual ports are now documented in
the UPDATING file.

For more information about new, changed or removed ports/packages, or if
you wish to search for a specific application to see if it’s available
as a port/package, you may use the form above; alternatively, you may
wish to visit FreshPorts.org and either browse the site or subscribe to
the lists hosted there.

To learn more about installing and maintaining ports, see Installing
Applications: Packages and Ports, a section of the FreeBSD Handbook; the
section of the Porter’s Handbook called Keeping Up; and the ports(7)
manual page.
