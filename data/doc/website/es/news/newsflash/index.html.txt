-    21 Enero: In order to make the process of translating FreeBSD's
    official articles and books more accessible to new contributors, the
    project is adopting Weblate as its web-based continuous localization
    platform. This tool has been in use for some months by some of our
    translation teams (pt_BR, es_ES and zh_CN) and due to the excellent
    results obtained and the maturity of the workflow adopted, we
    believe we are ready to open it to new collaborators. With the
    adoption of this new tool the translation process has become quite

-    19 Junio: FreeBSD celebrated its 20th birthday today. On June 19,
    1993, Jordan Hubbard, Rod Grimes, and David Greenman announced to
    the world the creation of their new fork of the BSD 4.3 operating
    system. FreeBSD was derived from the 386BSD 0.1 release from Bill
    and Lynne Jolitz with its 1.0 release in Nov 1993. Its stated goals
    were to create a fast, stable, reliable server OS for i386 systems.
    Since then, it has become the backbone of countless products and has
    grown to supporting 64bit computing, embedded devices, and desktop
    users.

    CVSup or csup(1) will no longer be available after that date. All
    users who use CVS, CVSup or csup(1) to update the ports tree are
    encouraged to switch to portsnap(8) or for users which need more
    control over their ports collection checkout, use Subversion
    directly. More information are available in the announcement mail on
    the FreeBSD ports announce mailing list. A migration guide from
    CVSup or csup(1) to portsnap(8) is also available in the FreeBSD
    Handbook.
