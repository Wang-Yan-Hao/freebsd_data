A problem report, or PR, can be about any component of FreeBSD,
including problems with the operating system programs, a mistake in the
documentation, or a new feature that the submitter wishes to see
incorporated.

Problem reports begin in the open state, and are closed when the issue
is resolved. A numeric ID is assigned to each PR for tracking. Many
FreeBSD changes refer to the PR number that prompted the change.

How to Submit a Problem Report

Problem reports are submitted to the development team with the web form.
An account will need to be created before a bug can be submitted. Please
note that messages sent to a mailing list are not tracked as official
problem reports, and may get lost in the noise!

Before submitting a problem report, please read the Writing FreeBSD
Problem Reports article. This article describes when to submit a problem
report and what to include. Some useful background information is also
contained in the Problem Report Handling Guidelines article.

FreeBSD problem reports are tracked using Bugzilla.
