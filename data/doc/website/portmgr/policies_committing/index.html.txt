Policies of the Ports Management Team: Committing To The Tree

These are the specific policies that the Ports Management Team has
adopted regarding commits to the ports tree.

Changes to bsd.port.mk

portmgr acts as sole committer for bsd.port.mk at all times. Proposed
changes must be submitted as PRs and assigned to portmgr.

Changes when the tree is open

Open to everything that would not require a regression test.

Changes when the tree is frozen

All changes must be approved by portmgr. In general, only the following
will be accepted:

-   fixes that would prevent a port from installing, deinstalling or
    running properly for the upcoming release.

-   security problems. If sufficiently severe, these may imply the need
    to create a slipped tag.

-   licensing issues. These require a slipped tag.

Changes when the tree is thawed

No sweeping changes. This is to prevent possibly having to rebuild all
the release packages.
