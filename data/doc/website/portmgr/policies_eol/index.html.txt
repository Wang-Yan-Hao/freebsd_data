Ports and Packages for Supported Releases

Support of FreeBSD releases by ports and the ports infrastructure
currently matches the policies set out by the FreeBSD Security Officer.
Once a major branch X reaches its EOL date, the "last known good" ports
tree will be tagged with the RELEASE_X_EOL tag as a convenience to those
remaining users who intend to self-support their installations. This tag
is not supported in any way and security fixes will not be applied.
Usage is therefore highly discouraged and should only be used if there
is no other option; consumers are expected to provide their own support.

For all supported major src branches, all ports will be included in an
automated quality assurance procedure which will build, install,
package, and deinstall each port on all Tier 1 platforms. Maintainers
and committers are notified of failures detected during testing. Ports
that are known not to build or run on a given supported branch and/or
platform will be marked as such.

Prebuilt binary packages will also be provided for all major branches
and Tier 1 platforms and will be made available via pkg(8). Package
builds will use the oldest supported minor release within each major
branch to ensure ABI and KBI backwards compatibility within each major
branch, and support all minor versions of each major branch, including
-RELEASE and -STABLE.

The current package sets and estimated lifetimes of the currently
supported branches are given below. The Estimated EoL (end-of-life)
column gives the earliest date on which that branch is likely to be
dropped.

Older releases are not maintained; ports and packages may not be able to
install or run. Users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to one of the
supported releases mentioned above.
