The FreeBSD.org Network

This page documents, for those with accounts on the FreeBSD.org network,
just what machine resources are currently available and the sorts of
jobs they are being provided for.

For a list of SSH host keys and their fingerprints for the public
FreeBSD.org machines, please see this file.

Developer FreeBSD.org hosts

These systems are available for FreeBSD developer / committer use.
Reference systems can be used for build tests etc.

switch with redundant gigabit uplinks. All systems have logged serial
consoles and remote power management.
