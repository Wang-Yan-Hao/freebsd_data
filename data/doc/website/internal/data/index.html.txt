User Data Policy

Rationale

The FreeBSD Project provides several resources for developers including
various machines and data storage. These resources are intended to be
used for activities related to the FreeBSD Project. The project does not
make any guarantees to developers regarding non-project-related data
stored on project resources. Developers are strongly encouraged to not
use project resources for storing non-project-related data. The FreeBSD
Core team approved the following user data policy which was posted to
the Developers mailing list on August 4, 2011.

Policy

FreeBSD Project resources should only be used for project-related
activities and storing project-related data.
