FreeBSD Internal Pages

This page contains pointers to pages documenting aspects of the FreeBSD
project itself, as viewed separately from the codebase.

Projects

There are various projects which lie outside the mainstream development
path. A number of groups are working on the 'cutting edge' to expand
FreeBSD’s range of capabilities in new directions.

Here is an overview of the FreeBSD Release Engineering Process.

And here you will find the schedules for upcoming official releases of
FreeBSD.

Policies

To avoid chaos with a project this large spread out all over the globe,
there have to be some Policies for FreeBSD Committers.

People

The FreeBSD Project Staff consists of teams, groups and individuals with
designated project roles and areas of responsibility and the developers.
By following the links, one will find a list of them, as well as
explanations of who is responsible for what.

You can read here core’s Hat Term Limits Policy and some guidelines from
Warner Losh on how to work with hats.

Resources

Here is a list of some technical resources for FreeBSD committers.

For those with accounts on the main FreeBSD.org network, here are the
machine resources that are available and the sorts of work they are
intended for.

You can learn more about the FreeBSD WWW server, including the machine,
the software, mirroring the FreeBSD web pages.
