Commit Bit and Project Resources Policy

Rationale

The core team manages access to project resources including granting and
revoking both commit bits and user accounts. Core may delegate portions
of these tasks to other groups or individuals at its discretion. For
example, certain commit bits are managed by other groups as noted in
Commit Bit Types subject to core’s final approval. The core team has
held this authority since its inception, but wanted to make it explicit
to avoid confusion. The FreeBSD Core team approved the following commit
bit and project resources policy which was posted to the Developers
mailing list on August 4, 2011.

Policy

The core team has sole authority for managing access to project
resources. This includes granting and revoking both commit bits and user
accounts.
