Commit Bit Expiration Policy

Rationale

Over time, FreeBSD committers may find other demands on their time, and
decide that they wish to resign their commit bit. However, under some
circumstances, a committer may become inactive over a long period of
time without explicitly resigning their bit. Over the long term, these
accounts can represent a security risk, as well as posing procedural
questions regarding the degree to which contact information and access
methods for the account are maintainable. For these reasons, the FreeBSD
Core Team approved the following commit bit expiration policy, last
updated in February 2021.

Policy

Documentation and source committers that have not made a commit in 18
months may have their commit bit removed from the access file. For ports
committers this period is 12 months. Committers are encouraged to
reactivate their commit bit by contacting the appropriate authority.

If all of a committer’s commit bits expire, then the committer’s
FreeBSD.org account will be suspended. It can remain active upon request
at the FreeBSD Core Team’s discretion. An account is suspended by
disabling login access and any other services (such as CGI scripts or
non-trivial mail forwarding configurations) that execute under the
committer’s account. Simple mail forwarding will continue to work, and
an individual may e-mail postmaster@FreeBSD.org to update mail
forwarding settings. The committer’s files may or may not be preserved
at the FreeBSD Core Team’s discretion. A suspended account will be
reactivated if any of a committer’s commit bits are restored.
