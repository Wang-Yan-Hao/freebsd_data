About the FreeBSD WWW Server

The Machine

[Powered by FreeBSD]

Naturally, all systems in the FreeBSD.org cluster run FreeBSD. The
hardware and network connection have been generously provided by:

-   Bytemark Hosting

-   Cloud and SDN Laboratory at BroadBand Tower, Inc

-   Department of Computer Science, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung
    University

-   Equinix

-   Internet Association of Australia

-   Internet Systems Consortium

-   INX-ZA

-   KDDI Web Communications Inc

-   Malaysian Research & Education Network

-   MetaPeer

-   New York Internet

-   NIC.br

-   Your.Org

 — and other contributors to the FreeBSD project.

A list of general-access machines in the FreeBSD.org domain is available
at the The FreeBSD.org Network page.

The Software

These pages are served up by the fast and flexible NGINX webserver and
Varnish HTTP Cache. In addition, there are a few locally crafted CGI
scripts. Indexing of the mailing list archive is provided by
freewais-sf, a derivative of the CNIDR freewais.

The Pages

[Lynx Friendly logo]

The original web pages were put together by John Fieber
<jfieber@FreeBSD.org> with input from the FreeBSD community and you.
<wosch@FreeBSD.org> was our first webmaster but this responsibility is
now shared by a larger team of web and documentation contributors. The
FreeBSD pages are valid XHTML 1.0 Transitional and should degrade
gracefully on any browser.

Page Design

The current website design was done by Emily Boyd as part of the Google
Summer of Code program in 2005.

The original page design was done by Megan McCormack.

Update of the FreeBSD Web Pages

The FreeBSD Web Pages on www.FreeBSD.org are currently rebuilt according
to the following schedule:

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Build Time (UTC)                  | Build type                        |
+===================================+===================================+
| Every 10 minutes                  | If there is a change in the doc   |
|                                   | repository                        |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

The document FreeBSD Documentation Project Primer for New Contributors
describes how to build the FreeBSD documentation from the Git
repository.
