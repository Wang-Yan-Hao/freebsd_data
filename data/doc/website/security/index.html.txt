FreeBSD Security Information

Introduction

FreeBSD takes security very seriously and its developers are constantly
working on making the operating system as secure as possible. This page
will provide information about what to do in the event of a security
vulnerability affecting your system

Table of Contents

-   Reporting FreeBSD security incidents

-   Recent FreeBSD security vulnerabilities

-   Understanding FreeBSD security advisories

-   How to update your system

-   Supported FreeBSD releases

-   The FreeBSD support model

Reporting FreeBSD security incidents

FreeBSD security issues specific to the base system should be reported
via email to the FreeBSD Security Team or, if a higher level of
confidentiality is required, via PGP encrypted email to the Security
Officer Team using the Security Officer PGP key. Additional information
can be found at the reporting FreeBSD security incidents page.

When is a Security Advisory considered?

For every issue that gets reported, an internal tracking number is
created, unless something is very obviously not a security issue. To
determine whether or not a Security Advisory is warranted we use the
following scheme:

-   Is it a privilege escalation vulnerability?

-   Is it a code injection vulnerability?

-   Is it a memory disclosure or dataleak vulnerability?

    -   From either the kernel

    -   From a privileged process

    -   From a process owned by another user?

-   Is it a Denial of Service vulnerability?

    -   Only when remotely exploitable, where remotely means that it
        comes from a different broadcast domain, so ARP and/or NDP based
        attacks do not qualify.

-   Is it an unassisted jailbreak vulnerability?

-   Is it a malfunction that could lead to generating insecure crypto
    keys, such as a PRNG bug?

For items that fall under these categories, a Security Advisory is very
likely. Items that are not on this list are looked into individually and
it will be determined then whether or not it will receive a Security
Advisory or an Errata Notice.

Once it had been determined that a Security Advisory is warranted,
either the submitter delivers a CVE number if he/she already requested
one, or we use one from the FreeBSD pool available.

Recent FreeBSD security vulnerabilities

A full list of all security vulnerabilities affecting the base system
can be found on this page.

Understanding FreeBSD security advisories

Advisories affecting the base system are sent to the following mailing
lists:

-   FreeBSD-security-notifications@FreeBSD.org

-   FreeBSD-security@FreeBSD.org

-   FreeBSD-announce@FreeBSD.org

The list of released advisories can be found on the FreeBSD Security
Advisories page.

Advisories are always signed using the FreeBSD Security Officer PGP key
and are archived, along with their associated patches, at the
https://security.FreeBSD.org web server in the advisories and patches
subdirectories.

The FreeBSD Security Officer provides security advisories for -STABLE
Branches and the Security Branches. (Advisories are not issued for the
-CURRENT Branch, which is primarily oriented towards FreeBSD
developers.)

-   The -STABLE branch tags have names like stable/13. The corresponding
    builds have names like FreeBSD 13.1-STABLE.

-   Each FreeBSD Release has an associated Security Branch. The Security
    Branch tags have names like releng/13.1. The corresponding builds
    have names like FreeBSD 13.1-RELEASE-p1.

Issues affecting the FreeBSD Ports Collection are covered separately in
the FreeBSD VuXML document.

How to update your system

For users that have previously installed a binary version of FreeBSD
(e.g., 13.1 or 12.3), commands:

# freebsd-update fetch

# freebsd-update install

If that fails, follow the other instructions in the security advisory
you care about.

Note that the above procedure is only for users who have previously
installed a binary distribution. Those who have built from source will
need to update their source tree to upgrade.

Supported FreeBSD releases

Each release is supported by the Security Officer for a limited time
only.

The designation and expected lifetime of all currently supported
branches and their respective releases are given below. The Expected EoL
(end-of-life) column indicates the earliest date on which support for
that branch or release will end. Please note that these dates may be
pushed back if circumstances warrant it.

Older releases are not supported and users are strongly encouraged to
upgrade to one of these supported releases:

+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| Branch          | Release         | Release Date    | Expected EoL    |
+=================+=================+=================+=================+
| stable/13       | n/a             | n/a             | January 31,     |
|                 |                 |                 | 2026            |
+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| releng/13.2     | 13.2-RELEASE    | April 11, 2023  | 13.3-RELEASE +  |
|                 |                 |                 | 3 months        |
+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| releng/13.1     | 13.1-RELEASE    | May 16, 2022    | July 31, 2023   |
+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| stable/12       | n/a             | n/a             | December 31,    |
|                 |                 |                 | 2023            |
+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| releng/12.4     | 12.4-RELEASE    | December 5,     | December 31,    |
|                 |                 | 2022            | 2023            |
+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+

In the run-up to a release, a number of -BETA and -RC releases may be
published for testing purposes. These releases are only supported for a
few weeks, as resources permit, and will not be listed as supported on
this page. Users are strongly discouraged from running these releases on
production systems.

The FreeBSD support model

Under the current support model, each major version’s stable branch is
explicitly supported for 5 years, while each individual point release is
only supported for three months after the next point release.

The details and rationale behind this model can be found in the official
announcement sent in February 2015.
