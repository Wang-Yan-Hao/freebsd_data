The BSD Daemon

The little red fellow that graces many of these pages is the BSD Daemon.
In the context of UNIX® systems, daemons are process that run in the
background attending to various tasks without human intervention. In the
general sense, daemon is an older form of the word demon. In the Unix
System Administration Handbook, Evi Nemeth has this to say about
daemons:

  "Many people equate the word "daemon" with the word "demon," implying
  some kind of Satanic connection between UNIX® and the underworld. This
  is an egregious misunderstanding. "Daemon" is actually a much older
  form of "demon"; daemons have no particular bias towards good or evil,
  but rather serve to help define a person’s character or personality.
  The ancient Greeks' concept of a "personal daemon" was similar to the
  modern concept of a "guardian angel" - "eudaemonia" is the state of
  being helped or protected by a kindly spirit. As a rule, UNIX® systems
  seem to be infested with both daemons and demons." (p403)

The earliest (and most popular) renditions of the BSD Daemon were
created by John Lasseter. More recent FreeBSD-specific renditions have
done by Tatsumi Hosokawa, but the basic inspiration was definitely
John’s. The copyright holder and creator of the daemon image is Marshall
Kirk McKusick. A short pictorial history is also available. There is a
gallery of FreeBSD related publications that use variations of the
daemon graphic.

Various size stuffed and beanie daemons are available from the FreeBSD
Mall [beanie daemon].
