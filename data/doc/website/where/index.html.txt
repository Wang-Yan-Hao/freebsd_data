Release Information.

Choosing an Architecture

Most users of FreeBSD will have hardware for amd64 or aarch64. These
architectures are well-supported.

Most modern PCs, including those with Intel® processors, use amd64.

Embedded devices and single-board computers (SBCs) such as the Raspberry
Pi 3 and 4, ESPRESSObin, as well as many Allwinner and Rockchip boards,
use aarch64.

For all other architectures, please see the table of supported
platforms.

Choosing an Image

For the FreeBSD installer: formats include CD (disc1), DVD (dvd1), and
network install (bootonly) sized ISO, plus regular and mini USB memory
sticks.

For virtual machines: virtual disk images have FreeBSD preinstalled.

For embedded platforms: SD card images are available.

Production Quality

RELEASE versions of FreeBSD are the end result of release engineering.

Applications and Utility Software

The Ports Collection

A diverse collection of utility and application software that has been
ported to FreeBSD.

-   About FreeBSD Ports

-   FreshPorts - a more advanced web interface to the Collection

-   Installing Applications: Packages and Ports in the FreeBSD Handbook

-   Browse the Collection: web | FTP.

For information about how you can contribute your favorite piece of
software to the Collection, have a look at The Porter’s Handbook and
Contributing to FreeBSD.

FreeBSD-derived Operating System Distributions

FreeBSD is widely used as a building block for other commercial and
open-source operating systems. The projects below are of particular
interest.

-   TrueNAS is network attached storage (NAS) software that shares and
    protects data from modern-day threats like ransomware and malware.
    TrueNAS makes it easy for users and client devices to access shared
    data through virtually any sharing protocol.

-   GhostBSD is derived from FreeBSD, and uses the GTK environment to
    provide a beautiful look and a comfortable experience on a modern
    BSD platform offering a natural and native UNIX®-like work
    environment.

-   MidnightBSD was forked from FreeBSD 6.1 beta, and continues to use
    parts of more recent FreeBSD code bases. Developed with desktop
    users in mind, MidnightBSD includes everything that you would expect
    for your daily tasks: mail, web browsing, word processing, gaming,
    and much more.

-   NomadBSD is a persistent live system for USB flash drives, based on
    FreeBSD. Together with automatic hardware detection and setup, it is
    configured to be used as a desktop system that works out of the box,
    but can also be used for data recovery, for educational purposes, or
    to test FreeBSD hardware compatibility.

-   pfSense is a FreeBSD-based customized distribution tailored for use
    as a firewall and router.
