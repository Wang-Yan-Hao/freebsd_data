FreeBSD/MIPS Project

Project Goal

The FreeBSD/MIPS Project is responsible for the maintenance and
development of FreeBSD on platforms using MIPS processors. The port
currently runs multi-user on a number of platforms and a wide variety of
32-bit and 64-bit MISP ISA processors.

Supported MIPS Platforms

FreeBSD supports a broad range of MIPS-based devices, including MIPS
Malta, Ubiquiti Networks Router-Station and Router-Station Pro, Cavium
Octeon, NetLogicMicro/RMI XLS and XLR (XLP in progress), as well as
emulated MIPS environments such as gxemul. On supporting hardware
platforms, FreeBSD supports both multi-core and hardware multi-threading
features. In many cases, additional accelerator functions, such as
cryptographic and network offload engines, are also supported.

How to Contribute

If you have code that you are interested in committing, you can send it
for review to the freebsd-mips mailing list.
