FreeBSD/MIPS Project

Introduction

This page contains information about porting FreeBSD to the MIPS®
platform. Discussion of the MIPS port takes place on the freebsd-mips
mailing list.

Status

MIPS is a Tier 2 architecture, and as such is not fully supported by the
FreeBSD project.

FreeBSD/MIPS Hardware Notes

FreeBSD/MIPS is a port of the FreeBSD operating system to platforms
based around MIPS processors. At the moment, several MIPS32 and MIPS64
development boards and embedded platforms are being targeted.

Listing all supported devices on all CPUs and boards is impractical
here, however much information can be obtained from the mailing list and
archives, the FreeBSD/MIPS Wiki pages, and also from the Kernel
Configuration files

CPUs

The following non-exhaustive list of CPUs and CPU families are
supported:

-   MIPS4Kc

-   MIPS24Kc

-   MIPS74Kc

-   Atheros AR71xx, AR724x, AR91xx, AR933x, AR934x

-   Cavium OCTEON

-   NetLogic XLR/XLS CPU family

-   SRI/Cambridge’s BERI and CHERI open-source FPGA soft-cores

Note that not all peripherals are supported on all CPUs.

Boards

The following boards are supported:

-   Ubiquiti Networks Router-Station (AR7130)

-   Ubiquiti Networks Router-Station Pro (AR7161)

-   Ubiquiti Networks PicoStation M2HP (AR7241)

-   Ubiquiti Networks EdgeRouter Lite (OCTEON)

-   TP-Link TL-WR1043ND (AR9132)

-   Mikrotik RouterBoard RB450G

-   Alfa Networks Hornet UB (AR933x)

-   D-Link DIR-825 (AR7161)

-   Atheros PB44, PB47, AP94, AP96 reference designs (AR7161)

-   Atheros DB120 reference design (AR9344)

-   8devices Carambola-2 (AR9330)

-   Engenius ENH-200 (AR7240+AR9285)

-   Buffalo Airstation WZR-300HP B0 A1

-   MIPS Malta evaluation board

-   Lanner MR-320, MR-730, MR-995 (OCTEON)

-   Portwell CAM-0100 (OCTEON)

-   Radisys AMC-7211 / ATCA-7220 (OCTEON)

-   D-Link DSR-500, DSR-500N, DSR-1000 and DSR-1000N (OCTEON)

-   GE Intelligent Platforms WANIC 6354 (OCTEON)

-   Cavium development boards CN5860-EVB-NIC4, CN5650-EVB-NIC16,
    CN5200-EVB-MB4

Note that not all peripherals are supported on all boards.
