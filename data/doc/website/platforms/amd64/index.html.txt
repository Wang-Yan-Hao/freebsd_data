FreeBSD/amd64 Project

[BSD Daemon swinging a sledge hammer]

This page contains information of the FreeBSD port to AMD’s AMD64 and
Intel® 64 architecture, often also known as "x86-64" or "x64".
FreeBSD/amd64 is suitable for almost all recent AMD and Intel CPUs.

The AMD64 architecture was previously known as "Hammer". The Intel 64
architecture was previously known as Yamhill, Clackamas Technology (CT),
IA-32e, and EM64T (Extended Memory 64-bit Technology).

Newer AMD Sempron™, the AMD Opteron™, AMD Athlon™ 64, AMD Turion™, AMD
Phenom™, and AMD EPYC™ processors, and processors with AMD Zen cores all
use the AMD64 architecture.

The Intel vPro™, Intel Celeron D (some models since "Prescott"), Intel
Centrino® Duo, Intel Centrino® Pro, Intel Viiv™, Intel Core™2 Extreme,
Intel Core™2 Quad, Intel Core™2 Duo, Intel Xeon (3000-sequence,
5000-sequence, and 7000-sequence), and the Intel Core™ i range of
processors use the Intel® 64 architecture.

Status

FreeBSD/amd64 runs in 64-bit multiuser mode, in both Uniprocessor and
Multiprocessor mode.

The AMD64 platform is a Tier 1 FreeBSD platform.
