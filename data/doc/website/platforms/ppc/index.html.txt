FreeBSD/ppc Project

Introduction

The FreeBSD/ppc project pages contain information about the FreeBSD port
to the PowerPC® architecture. As with the port itself, these pages are
still a work in progress.

Status

The FreeBSD/ppc port is still a Tier 2 platform. That means it is not
being fully supported by our security officer, release engineers and
toolchain maintainers. However, it is supported by portmgr (package
building).

The most up-to-date information about supported hardware is currently
being maintained on the wiki.

Latest News

-   13 Apr, 2021: FreeBSD 13.0 was released introducing new target
    powerpc64le and LLVM as main compiler. Supports disk, network and
    video controller drivers for modern POWER machines from Raptor
    Computing (Blackbird and Talos II) and IBM (LC922 and IC922).
    Release Notes

-   22 Sep, 2020: new target powerpc64le (64-bit little endian) was
    introduced targetting POWER8 and newer processors.

-   29 Dec, 2019: Release 13.0 for powerpc, powerpcspe and powerpc64
    targets will replace GCC4 by LLVM compiler and powerpc64 will use
    the modern OpenPower 64-Bit ELF V2 ABI Specification.

-   05 May, 2019: FreeBSD has been tested and seems to work on the
    Raptor Blackbird.

Frequently Asked Questions

1.  How can I install FreeBSD/ppc

2.  How to use ports on FreeBSD/ppc?

3.  Should I install powerpc, powerpcspe, powerpc64 or powerpc64le?

4.  Who should I contact?

How can I install FreeBSD/ppc?

ISO images of FreeBSD 13.0 are available for download, for details on
how to obtain these see the release announcement. FreeBSD 12.x is not
being maintained regularly and its use is strongly discouraged. ABI
changes makes 12.x binary-incompatible with 13.x and later.

How to use ports on FreeBSD/ppc?

Refer to the Handbook: use the Ports Collection.

Should I install powerpc, powerpcspe, powerpc64 or powerpc64le?

-   64-bit

    -   Users of 64-bit bi-endian CPUs POWER8 and POWER9: can choose
        between FreeBSD/powerpc64 and FreeBSD/powerpc64le (big endian
        and little endian, respectively). The FreeBSD/powerpc64 (big
        endian) also supports running 32-bit binaries nativelly like
        other 64-bit platforms.

    -   Users of 64-bit big endian CPUs Apple G5 and POWER7:
        FreeBSD/powerpc64 should be installed. Apple G5 users also have
        a choice of using the 32-bit FreeBSD/powerpc but
        FreeBSD/powerpc64 provides ZFS support and the ability of use
        more than 2 GB of RAM.

-   32-bit

    -   Users of 32-bit CPUs Apple G3/G4: should use FreeBSD/powerpc

    -   Users of 32-bit CPUs Freescale MPC85XX (Routerboard RB800) and
        NXP QorIQ P1022 (AmigaOne A1222): should use FreeBSD/powerpcspe

Who should I contact?

The FreeBSD/ppc mailing list is the main resource.

Supported Hardware

The most up-to-date information about supported hardware is currently
being maintained on the wiki.

The FreeBSD/ppc port should run on any New-World Apple machine (any
Apple machine with a built-in USB port), as well as the Sony Playstation
3. FreeBSD/ppc port should also run on QEMU. Details can be found on
powerpc/QEMU wiki.

People have previously reported that FreeBSD runs on the following
machines:

Known Issues

-   Raptor CS Blackbird and Talos II: recent firmware versions don’t
    report the onboard video framebuffer memory address on the device
    tree anymore. The workaround is append the content below to the
    kernel arguments during boot or set it permanently in
    /boot/etc/kboot.conf: :

        hw.ofwfb.physaddr=0x000600c280000000

    Note: FreeBSD 13.1, yet to be released, detects the memory address
    automatically using an alternative method

-   IBM POWER8 and POWER9: As of 2021-11-30 the firmware of IBM POWER9
    and some IBM POWER8 machines contain a version of kexec-lite with a
    regression that computes FreeBSD kernel entry point erroneously.
    Workaround: on petitboot console download http://drop.rtk0.net/kexec
    and use it manually to load the kernel instead. Thanks Brandon
    Bergren for making the fixed binary available.

-   On New-World Apples, there is a known bug in the boot-loader, that
    prevents you from loading an alternate kernel, so testing your
    kernel is a bit risky. When booting the loader from the Open
    Firmware prompt, give it a partition which is either non-existent,
    doesn’t have a kernel to load, or isn’t a UFS partition:

        0 > boot hd:loader hd:0

    At this point, you can set currdev and manually load a kernel:

        OK set currdev="hd":14
        OK load /boot/kernel/kernel.save
