FreeBSD/i386 Project

Introduction

This page contains information about the FreeBSD/i386 platform.
FreeBSD/i386 should support any CPU compatible with the Intel(T) 80486
or better in 32-bit mode, although almost every recent AMD(T) and
Intel(T) CPU will also be capable of running in 64-bit mode using the
FreeBSD/amd64 port.

FreeBSD/i386 supports up to 4GiB of RAM by default. Machines with more
RAM will either need to run FreeBSD/amd64 or run with Physical Address
Extension (PAE) enabled in order to make use of any memory above the
4GiB boundary.

Status

FreeBSD/i386 runs in 32-bit multiuser mode, in both Uniprocessor and
Multiprocessor mode.

The i386 platform is a Tier 1 FreeBSD platform through FreeBSD 12.x. It
is a Tier 2 platform in FreeBSD 13.0 and later.
