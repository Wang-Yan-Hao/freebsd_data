FreeBSD/ARM Project

Introduction

This page contains information about the FreeBSD port to the 32- and
64-bit ARM architectures and hardware. Discussion of the ARM ports takes
place on the freebsd-arm mailing list.

Status

32-bit ARMv6 and ARMv7 are officially a Tier 2 architecture, as the
FreeBSD Project does not provide official releases or pre-built packages
for this platform due to it primarily targeting the embedded arena.
However, FreeBSD/ARM is being actively developed and maintained, is well
supported, and provides an excellent framework for building ARM-based
systems. FreeBSD/arm supported ARMv4 and ARMv5 processors, and is
deprecated as of 13.0. FreeBSD/armv7 includes SMP support.

FreeBSD/arm64 supports 64-bit ARMv8 processors and is a Tier 1
architecture as of 13.0. 64-bit ARM platforms follow a set of standard
conventions, and a single FreeBSD build will work on hardware from
multiple vendors. As a result, FreeBSD provides official releases for
FreeBSD/arm64 and packages are available.

FreeBSD/ARM Hardware Notes

FreeBSD/arm and FreeBSD/armv6 support a large range of ARM CPUs and
development boards. Not every peripheral is supported on every CPU or
board, though work continues towards this and contributions are always
welcome. Conversely, many CPUs and boards not listed may work with only
minimal changes needed.

Listing all supported devices on all CPUs and boards is impractical
here, however much information can be obtained from the mailing list and
archives, the FreeBSD ARM wiki pages, and from the kernel configuration
files

What Needs to be Done

-   SATA support needs to be added for boards currently missing it.

-   Other devices, such as watchdog, i2c and bus should be merged from
    NetBSD.

Mini-install Guide

Olivier Houchard <cognet@FreeBSD.org> has written a mini-install guide
for the current FreeBSD source. It is available here.
