FreeBSD 2.1.6 Announcement

Please read an important security announcement regarding FreeBSD 2.1.6

FreeBSD 2.1.6 is now available in:

  ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/2.1.6-RELEASE

And shortly from its various mirror sites, a list of which may be
obtained from: http://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/mirrors.html

This release will also be available on CDROM from Walnut Creek CDROM,
hopefully shipping within the next 4-6 weeks.

Those puzzled by the near-simultaneous release of 2.1.6 and 2.2 need
also look no further than http://www.FreeBSD.org/branch.html for the
reasons behind this release schedule. CDROM subscription customers
should also see this page for information on Walnut Creek CDROM’s plans
for these releases.

If you are a commercial user of FreeBSD who would like to take advantage
of recent bug fixes without making the jump to our more ambitious 2.2
release (or delay that jump until 2.2 has had more time to mature), or
if you’re simply looking for the lowest-impact upgrade from 2.1.5, then
2.1.6-RELEASE is for you.
