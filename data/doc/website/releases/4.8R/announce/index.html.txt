FreeBSD 4.8-RELEASE Announcement

Date: Thu, 3 Apr 2003 21:43:09 -0800
From: "Murray Stokely" <murray@FreeBSD.org>
To: freebsd-announce@FreeBSD.org
Subject: FreeBSD 4.8-RELEASE is now available

I am happy to announce the availability of FreeBSD 4.8-RELEASE, the
latest release of the FreeBSD -STABLE development branch. Since FreeBSD
4.7-RELEASE in October 2002, we have made conservative updates to a
number of software programs in the base system, added initial support
for Firewire and other new hardware technologies, and dealt with known
security issues.

For a complete list of new features and known problems, please see the
release notes and errata list, available here:

http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/4.8R/relnotes.html

http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/4.8R/errata.html

This release does not include all of the new technologies that were
introduced with FreeBSD 5.0 in January. FreeBSD 4.X releases offer a
more conservative platform than FreeBSD 5.0 at this time. For more
information about the distinctions between FreeBSD 4.X and 5.0, or for
general information about the FreeBSD release engineering activities,
please see :

http://www.FreeBSD.org/releng/

Availability

FreeBSD 4.8-RELEASE supports the i386 and alpha architectures and can be
installed directly over the net using the boot floppies or copied to a
local NFS/FTP server. Distributions for the i386 are available now. As
of this writing, the final builds for the alpha architecture are in
progress and will be made available shortly.

Please continue to support the FreeBSD Project by purchasing media from
one of our supporting vendors. The following companies have contributed
substantially to the development of FreeBSD:

  -------------------- --------------------------------------
  FreeBSD Mall, Inc.   http://www.freebsdmall.com/
  Daemon News          http://www.bsdmall.com/freebsd1.html
  -------------------- --------------------------------------

Each CD or DVD set contains the FreeBSD installation and application
package bits for the i386 ("PC") architecture. For a set of distfiles
used to build ports in the ports collection, please see the FreeBSD
Toolkit, a 6 CD set containing extra bits which no longer fit on the 4
CD set, or the DVD distribution.

If you can't afford FreeBSD on media, or just want to use it for
evangelism purposes, then by all means download the ISO images. We can't
promise that all the mirror sites will carry the larger ISO images, but
they will at least be available from:

-   ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/
-   ftp://ftp12.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/
-   ftp://ftp14.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/
-   ftp://ftp.tw.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/
-   ftp://ftp6.tw.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/
-   ftp://ftp{2,4,7}.de.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/
-   ftp://ftp.es.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/
-   ftp://ftp.au.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/

FreeBSD is also available via anonymous FTP from mirror sites in the
following countries: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada,
China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hong
Kong, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Lithuania, the
Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Saudi
Arabia, South Africa, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan,
Thailand, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom.

Before trying the central FTP site, please check your regional mirror(s)
first by going to:

ftp://ftp.<yourdomain>.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD

Any additional mirror sites will be labeled ftp2, ftp3 and so on.

More information about FreeBSD mirror sites can be found at:

http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/mirrors-ftp.html

For instructions on installing FreeBSD, please see Chapter 2 of The
FreeBSD Handbook. It provides a complete installation walk-through for
users new to FreeBSD, and can be found online at:

http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/install.html

Acknowledgments

finance the release engineering activities for FreeBSD 4.8 including The
FreeBSD Mall, Compaq, Yahoo!, Sentex Communications, and NTT/Verio.

  ---------------------------------------- ------------------------------------

Please join me in thanking them for all the hard work which went into
making this release. Many thanks are also due to the FreeBSD committers
(committers@FreeBSD.org), without whom there would be nothing to
release, and thousands of FreeBSD users world-wide who have contributed
bug fixes, features, and suggestions.

Enjoy!
