FreeBSD 10.0 Release Process

Introduction

This is the release schedule for FreeBSD 10.0. For more information
about the release engineering process, please see the Release
Engineering section of the web site.

General discussions about the pending release and known issues should be
sent to the public freebsd-stable mailing list. MFC requests should be
sent to re@FreeBSD.org.

Schedule

During the head freeze, the Release Engineering Team may create ALPHA
snapshots to publish for testing purposes. As the frequency and total
number of the ALPHA snapshots will depend on the length of time the head
branch is frozen, no official schedule is provided.

Announcements regarding the availability of the ALPHA snapshots will be
sent to the freebsd-current and freebsd-snapshots mailing lists.
