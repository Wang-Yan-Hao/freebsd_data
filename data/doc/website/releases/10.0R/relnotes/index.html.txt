FreeBSD 10.0-RELEASE Release Notes

Abstract

The release notes for FreeBSD 10.0-RELEASE contain a summary of the
changes made to the FreeBSD base system on the 10.0-STABLE development
line. This document lists applicable security advisories that were
issued since the last release, as well as significant changes to the
FreeBSD kernel and userland. Some brief remarks on upgrading are also
presented.

Introduction

This document contains the release notes for FreeBSD 10.0-RELEASE. It
describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of FreeBSD. It
also provides some notes on upgrading from previous versions of FreeBSD.

The latest, up-to-date version of the release notes are available online
at FreeBSD 10.0-RELEASE Release Notes.

This distribution of FreeBSD 10.0-RELEASE is a release distribution. It
can be found at http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/ or any of its mirrors.
More information on obtaining this (or other) release distributions of
FreeBSD can be found in the Obtaining FreeBSD' appendix to the FreeBSD
Handbook.

All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before installing
FreeBSD. The errata document is updated with "late-breaking" information
discovered late in the release cycle or after the release. Typically, it
contains information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections
to documentation. An up-to-date copy of the errata for FreeBSD
10.0-RELEASE can be found on the FreeBSD Web site.

What’s New

This section describes the most user-visible new or changed features in
FreeBSD since 9.2-RELEASE.

Typical release note items document recent security advisories issued
after 9.2-RELEASE, new drivers or hardware support, new commands or
options, major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades. They may
also list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering
practices. Clearly the release notes cannot list every single change
made to FreeBSD between releases; this document focuses primarily on
security advisories, user-visible changes, and major architectural
improvements.

Security Advisories

Problems described in the following security advisories have been fixed.

+----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+

Kernel Changes

Capsicum has been enabled in the kernel by default, allowing sandboxing
of several programs that work within the "capabilities mode".

The use of unmapped VMIO buffers eliminates the need to perform TLB
shootdown for mapping on buffer creation and reuse, greatly reducing the
amount of IPIs for shootdown on big-SMP machines and eliminating up to
25-30% of the system time on i/o intensive workloads. (r248508)

The ddb(4) kernel debugger now has an output capture facility. Input and
output from ddb(4) can now be captured to a memory buffer for later
inspection using sysctl(8) or a textdump. The new capture command
controls this feature.

The ddb(4) debugger now supports a simple scripting facility, which
supports a set of named scripts consisting of a set of ddb(4) commands.
These commands can be managed from within ddb(4) or with the use of the
new ddb(8) utility. More details can be found in the ddb(4) manual page.

Virtualization support

virtio(4) support has been added. virtio(4) is the name for the
paravirtualization interface developed for the Linux KVM, but since
adopted to other virtual machine hypervisors (with the notable exception
of Xen). This work brings in a BSD-licensed clean-room implementation of
the virtio kernel drivers for disk IO (virtio_blk(4) and
virtio_scsi(4)), network IO (vtnet(4)), memory ballooning
(virtio_balloon(4)), and PCI. Tested with on Qemu/KVM, VirtualBox, and
bhyve(4). (r227652)

    hv_ata_pci_disengage_load="YES"
    hv_netsvc_load="YES"
    hv_utils_load="YES"
    hv_vmbus_load="YES"

Alternatively, the Hyper-V drivers can be added to the i386 kernel by
adding device hyperv to the kernel config, and then recompiling the
kernel. Please refer to FreeBSD and Microsoft Windows Server Hyper-V
support for full instructions on how to set up Hyper-V support under
FreeBSD.

The vmx(4) driver has been added. vmx(4) is a VMware VMXNET3 ethernet
driver ported from OpenBSD. (r254738)

ARM support

Raspberry PI support has been added. Refer to these setup instructions
and this quick start guide. (r239922)

The default ABI on ARM is now the ARM EABI. This brings a number of
improvements and allows future support for VFP and Thumb-2. (r253396)

ARM support has been greatly improved, including support for ARMv6 and
ARMv7, SMP and thread-local storage (TLS). Additionally support for some
newer SoC like the MV78x60 and OMAP4 was added. See the announcement for
further details. (r239268)

Superpages support on ARM has been added. Superpages support provides
improved performance and scalability by allowing TLB translations to
dynamically cover large physical memory regions. All ARMv6 and
ARMv7-based platforms can take advantage of this feature. See the ARM
Superpages status page for further details. (r254918)

Hardware Support

Multimedia Support

Support for version 2.0 of the USB Audio reference design has been
added. New devices should support higher bandwidth, increased sampling
frequency and wider dynamic range. (r240609)

Network Interface Support

The firmware for the mxge(4) driver has been to 1.4.55. (r236212)

The re(4) driver has been overhauled to fix a number of issues. This
driver now has Wake On LAN (WOL) support.

The vr(4) driver has been overhauled to fix a number of outstanding
issues. It also now works on all architectures.

[amd64,i386] The wpi(4) driver has been updated to include a number of
stability fixes.

The cxgbe(4) driver has been updated to support 40G/10G Ethernet NICs
based on Chelsio’s Terminator 5 (T5) ASIC. (r248925)

The iw_cxgbe driver has been added. This is an experimental iWARP/RDMA
driver (kernel verbs only) for Chelsio’s T4 and T5 based cards.
(r256694)

The Open Fabrics Enterprise Distribution (OFED) and OFED Infiniband core
has been updated to the same version as supplied by Linux version 3.7
(r255932)

The Mellanox Infiniband driver has been updated to firmware version
2.30.3200 for ConnectX3 NICs. Support has been added for ConnectX3 VPI
NICs, where each port can be used as Infiniband 56 GB/s or Ethernet 40
GB/s. Support has been added for dynamically loading kernel modules for
Infiniband core (ibcore) and IP over Infiniband (ipoib). (r255932)

netmap(4) has been added. netmap(4) is a framework for high-performance
direct-to-hardware packet IO, offering low latency and high PPS rates to
userland applications while bypassing any kernel-side packet processing.
With netmap(4) it is trivially possible to fully saturate a 10 Gbps
network interface with minimal packet sizes. For more information, see:
Netmap Project. (r227614)

Network Protocols

carp(4) has been rewritten to make addresses more sane from the
viewpoint of routing daemons such as quagga/zebra. It also brings
support for a single redundant address on the subnet (carpdev),
switching state with ifconfig(8), better locking and using modern kernel
interfaces to allocate multicast memberships. Configuration of the CARP
protocol via ifconfig(8) has changed, as well as the format of CARP
events submitted to devd(8). See carp(4) for more information. The
arpbalance feature of carp(4) is currently not supported anymore.
(r228571)

The pf(4) firewall now supports fine-grain locking and better
utilization on multi-CPU machines, resulting in significant improvements
in performance. (r240233)

Support for up to 65536 routing tables has been introduced. (r250700)

Support for setting/matching differentiated services codepoints (DSCP)
in IP header has been added to ipfw(8). (r248552)

Disks and Storage

The aac(4) driver now supports volumes larger than 2TB in size.

The hptrr(4) driver has been updated to version 1.2 from Highpoint.

nvme(4) has been added and provides NVM Express support. NVM Express is
an optimized register interface, command set and feature set of PCI
Express (PCIe)-based Solid-State Drives (SSDs). For more information,
see nvmexpress.org. (r240616)

File Systems

A new kernel-based iSCSI target and initiator has been added. (r255570)

UFS filesystems can now be enlarged with growfs(8) while mounted
read-write. This is especially useful for virtual machines, allowing the
addition of more harddrive space without interruption of service.
(r243246)

A state of the art FUSE implementation is now part of the base system.
It allows the use of nearly all fusefs file systems. (r241519)

ZFS

bsdinstall(8) now supports installing ZFS on the root file system. It
includes a single configuration menu that allows you to select all of
the required details, including which drives to use, what ZFS RAID level
to use (taking into consideration the selected number of drives), GPT or
MBR, GELI encryption, forcing 4K sectors, pool name, etc. (r256361)

Support for L2ARC compression has been added to ZFS. (r252140)

The zio nop-write improvement from Illumos was imported into FreeBSD. To
reduce I/O, nop-write skips overwriting data if the (cryptographically
secure) checksum of new data matches the checksum of existing data. It
also saves space if snapshots are in use. This improvement only works on
datasets with enabled compression, disabled deduplication and sha256
checksums. ZFS will now compare the checksums of incoming writes to the
checksum of the existing on-disk data and avoid issuing any write I/O
for data that has not changed. This will reduce I/O as well as space
usage because if the old block is referenced by a snapshot, both copies
of the block are kept even though both contain the same data. (r243524)

Userland Changes

On platforms where clang(1) is the default system compiler (such as
i386, amd64, arm), GCC and GNU libstdc are no longer built by default.
http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=clang&sektion=1[clang(1)] and
libc from LLVM are used on these platforms by instead. GCC 4.2.1 and
libstdc++ are still built and used by default on pc98 and all other
platforms where clang(1) is not the default system compiler. (r255321)

clang(1) and llvm have been updated to version 3.3 release. Please refer
to Clang 3.3 Release Notes. (r251662)

BIND has been removed from the base system. unbound(8), which is
maintained by NLnet Labs, has been imported to support local DNS
resolution functionality with DNSSEC. Note that it is not a replacement
of BIND# and the latest versions of BIND# is still available in the
Ports Collection. With this change, nslookup and dig are no longer a
part of the base system. Users should instead use host(1) and drill(1)
Alternatively, nslookup and dig can be obtained by installing
dns/bind-tools port. (r255949)

sysinstall has been removed from the base system. Auxiliary libraries
and tools used by sysinstall such as libdisk, libftpio, and sade have
also been removed. sysinstall has been replaced by bsdinstall(8) and
bsdconfig(8). (r225937)

freebsd-version(1) has been added. This tool makes a best effort to
determine the version and patch level of the installed kernel and
userland. (r256106)

GNU patch has been removed from the base system, and replaced by a
BSD-licensed patch(1) program. (r255191)

GNU sort has been removed from the base system, and replaced by a
BSD-licensed sort(1) program. (r241511)

Berkeley yacc (byacc) has been imported from invisible island. This
brings bison compatibilities to yacc(1) while preserving full backwards
compatibility with previous version of yacc(1). (r235723)

lex(1) has been replaced by flex 2.5.37. (r250881)

make(1) has been replaced with the "Portable" BSD make tool (bmake) from
NetBSD. (r250699)

Support for usernames up to 32 characters. (r243023)

The adduser(8) utility now supports a -M option to set the mode of a new
user’s home directory.

BSD-licensed versions of ar(1) and ranlib(1), based on libarchive(3),
have replaced the GNU Binutils versions of these utilities.

BSD-licensed versions of bc(1) and dc(1) have replaced their GNU
counterparts.

chflags(1) now supports a -v flag for verbose output and a -f flag to
ignore errors with the same semantics as (for example) chmod(1).

For compatibility with other implementations, cp(1) now supports a -a
flag, which is equivalent to specifying the -RrP flags.

BSD-licensed version of cpio(1) based on libarchive(3), has replaced the
GNU cpio. Note that the GNU cpio is still installed as gcpio.

The env(1) program now supports -u name which will completely unset the
given variable `name` by removing it from the environment, instead of
just setting it to a null value.

The fdopendir(3) library function has been added.

The fetch(3) library now supports HTTP 1.1 If-Modified-Since behavior.
The fetch(1) program now supports -i filename which will only download
the specified HTTP URL if the content is newer than `filename`.

find(1) has been enhanced by the addition of a number of primaries that
were present in GNU find but not FreeBSD find(1).

kgdb(1) now supports a new add-kld command to make it easier to debug
crash dumps with kernel modules.

The ls(1) program now supports a -D option to specify a date format
string to be used with the long format (-l) output.

nc(1) now supports a -O switch to disable the use of TCP options.

nc(1)'s -o switch has been deprecated. It will be removed in a future
release.

The ping6(8) utility now returns 2 when the packet transmission was
successful but no responses were received (this is the same behavior as
ping(8)). It returned a non-zero value before this change.

The realpath(1) utility now supports a -q flag to suppress warnings; it
now also accepts multiple paths on its command line.

sh(1) has many bug fixes, some new features, and will now refuse to
parse some invalid scripts. Additionally, it now has filename completion
and defaults to the "emacs" editing mode.

The split(1) utility now supports a -n flag to split a file into a
certain number of chunks.

The tar(1) utility now supports a -Z flag to enable compress(1)-style
compression/decompression.

The tar(1) utility now supports a --numeric-owner flag to ignore
user/group names on create and extract.

The tar(1) utility now supports the -S flag to sparsify files on
extraction.

The tar(1) utility now supports a -s flag to substitute filenames based
on the specified regular expression.

The tcgetsid(3) library function has been added to return the process
group ID for the session leader for the controlling terminal. It is
defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (POSIX).

top(1) now supports a -P flag to provide per-CPU usage statistics.

zdump(8) is now working properly on 64-bit architectures.

traceroute(8) now has the ability to print the AS number for each hop
with the new -a switch; a new -A option allows selecting a particular
WHOIS server.

traceroute6(8) now supports a -U flag to send probe packets with no
upper-layer protocol, rather than the usual UDP probe packets.

/etc/rc.d Scripts

The followoing rc(8) scripts have been added:

Upgrading from previous releases of FreeBSD

[amd64,i386] Beginning with FreeBSD 6.2-RELEASE, binary upgrades between
RELEASE versions (and snapshots of the various security branches) are
supported using the freebsd-update(8) utility. The binary upgrade
procedure will update unmodified userland utilities, as well as
unmodified GENERIC or SMP kernels distributed as a part of an official
FreeBSD release. The freebsd-update(8) utility requires that the host
being upgraded have Internet connectivity.

Source-based upgrades (those based on recompiling the FreeBSD base
system from source code) from previous versions are supported, according
to the instructions in /usr/src/UPDATING.

Important:
Upgrading FreeBSD should, of course, only be attempted after backing up
all data and configuration files.
