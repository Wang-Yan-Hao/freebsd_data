FreeBSD 10.0-RELEASE Errata

Abstract

This document lists errata items for FreeBSD 10.0-RELEASE, containing
significant information discovered after the release or too late in the
release cycle to be otherwise included in the release documentation.
This information includes security advisories, as well as news relating
to the software or documentation that could affect its operation or
usability. An up-to-date version of this document should always be
consulted before installing this version of FreeBSD.

This errata document for FreeBSD 10.0-RELEASE will be maintained until
the release of FreeBSD 10.1-RELEASE.

Introduction

This errata document contains "late-breaking news" about FreeBSD
10.0-RELEASE Before installing this version, it is important to consult
this document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems
that may already have been found and fixed.

Any version of this errata document actually distributed with the
release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be out of date by
definition, but other copies are kept updated on the Internet and should
be consulted as the "current errata" for this release. These other
copies of the errata are located at http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/,
plus any sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.

Source and binary snapshots of FreeBSD 10.0-STABLE also contain
up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of the snapshot).

For a list of all FreeBSD CERT security advisories, see
http://www.FreeBSD.org/security/ or
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/.

Open Issues

-   FreeBSD/i386 10.0-RELEASE running as a guest operating system on
    VirtualBox can have a problem with disk I/O access. It depends on
    some specific hardware configuration and does not depend on a
    specific version of VirtualBox or host operating system.

    It causes various errors and makes FreeBSD quite unstable. Although
    the cause is still unclear, disabling unmapped I/O works as a
    workaround. To disable it, choose Escape to loader prompt in the
    boot menu and enter the following lines from loader(8) prompt, after
    an OK:

        set vfs.unmapped_buf_allowed=0
        boot

    Note that the following line has to be added to /boot/loader.conf
    after a boot. It disables unmapped I/O at every boot:

        vfs.unmapped_buf_allowed=0

    [2014-04-03 update] It has been reported that instability may be
    present on virtual machines running on other hypervisors, such as
    Xen or KVM.

-   A bug in Heimdal (an implementation of Kerberos authentication in
    FreeBSD base system) has been fixed. It could cause an
    interoperability issue between Heimdal and the other implementations
    including MIT Kerberos. However, due to this fix, Heimdal and some
    applications which depend on it in the previous FreeBSD releases do
    not work with one in 10.0-RELEASE in certain cases. Errata Notice
    for the supported releases to fix it will be released.

-   A bug in killall(1) has been discovered. It makes killall -INT to
    deliver SIGTERM rather than the desired SIGINT, and may cause
    blocking behavior for scripts that uses it, as -I means
    "interactive". A workaround of this would be to use -SIGINT instead.
    This bug has been fixed on FreeBSD-CURRENT and will be fixed in
    FreeBSD 10.0-STABLE.

-   The bxe(4) driver can cause packet corruption when TSO (TCP
    Segmentation Offload) feature is enabled. This feature is enabled by
    default and can be disabled by using a -tso parameter of
    ifconfig(8). It can be specified in rc.conf(5) like the following:

        ifconfig_bxe0="DHCP -tso"

    This bug has been fixed on FreeBSD 10.0-STABLE.

-   Due to a minor incompatibility with pkg(7) version 1.2.x,
    bsdconfig(8) will duplicate the list of available packages for
    installation. This is due to the PACKAGESITE environment variable
    being set for backwards compatibility with older versions of pkg(7).
    This affects generation of the available package list only, and does
    not affect the behavior when processing packages for installation.

-   A regression in pw(8) does not remove a user from groups not
    specified in the provided group list when the -G flag is used. This
    is expected to be corrected in FreeBSD-CURRENT and FreeBSD
    10.0-STABLE.

-   ipfw(8) fwd action can send packets to the correct interface with a
    wrong link-layer address when the route is updated. This bug has
    been fixed on FreeBSD-CURRENT and will be fixed in FreeBSD
    10.0-STABLE.

-   The mount_udf(8) utility has a bug which prevents it from mounting
    any UDF file system. This has been fixed in FreeBSD-CURRENT and
    FreeBSD 10.0-STABLE.

-   Updating LSI firmware on mps(4) controllers with the sas2flash
    utility may cause the system to hang, or may cause the system to
    panic. This is fixed in the stable/10 branch with revisions r262553
    and r262575, and will be included in FreeBSD 10.1-RELEASE.
