FreeBSD 13.2-RELEASE Release Notes

Abstract

The release notes for FreeBSD 13.2-RELEASE contain a summary of the
changes made to the FreeBSD base system on the 13-STABLE development
line. This document lists applicable security advisories that were
issued since the last release, as well as significant changes to the
FreeBSD kernel and userland. Some brief remarks on upgrading are also
presented.

Introduction

This document contains the release notes for FreeBSD 13.2-RELEASE. It
describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of FreeBSD. It
also provides some notes on upgrading from previous versions of FreeBSD.

The release distribution to which these release notes apply represents
the latest point along the 13-STABLE development branch since 13-STABLE
was created. Information regarding pre-built, binary release
distributions along this branch can be found at
https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/.

The release distribution to which these release notes apply represents a
point along the 13-STABLE development branch between 13.1-RELEASE and
the future 13.3-RELEASE. Information regarding pre-built, binary release
distributions along this branch can be found at
https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/.

This distribution of FreeBSD 13.2-RELEASE is a release distribution. It
can be found at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/ or any of its mirrors.
More information on obtaining this (or other) release distributions of
FreeBSD can be found in the Obtaining FreeBSD appendix to the FreeBSD
Handbook.

All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before installing
FreeBSD. The errata document is updated with "late-breaking" information
discovered late in the release cycle or after the release. Typically, it
contains information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections
to documentation. An up-to-date copy of the errata for FreeBSD
13.2-RELEASE can be found on the FreeBSD Web site.

This document describes the most user-visible new or changed features in
FreeBSD since 13.1-RELEASE. In general, changes described here are
unique to the 13-STABLE branch unless specifically marked as MERGED
features.

Typical release note items document recent security advisories issued
after 13.1-RELEASE, new drivers or hardware support, new commands or
options, major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades. They may
also list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering
practices. Clearly the release notes cannot list every single change
made to FreeBSD between releases; this document focuses primarily on
security advisories, user-visible changes, and major architectural
improvements.

Upgrading from Previous Releases of FreeBSD

Binary upgrades between RELEASE versions (and snapshots of the various
security branches) are supported using the freebsd-update(8) utility.
The binary upgrade procedure will update unmodified userland utilities,
as well as unmodified GENERIC kernels distributed as a part of an
official FreeBSD release. The freebsd-update(8) utility requires that
the host being upgraded have Internet connectivity.

Source-based upgrades (those based on recompiling the FreeBSD base
system from source code) from previous versions are supported, according
to the instructions in /usr/src/UPDATING.

Users of all PowerPC architectures, after successful kernel and world
installation, must run kldxref /boot/kernel manually.

Userland

This section covers changes and additions to userland applications,
contributed software, and system utilities.

Userland Configuration Changes

The growfs(7) startup script will now add a swap partition while
expanding the root file system if possible, and if one did not
previously exist. This is primarily useful when installing on an SD card
using a raw image. A new rc.conf(5) variable has been added,
growfs_swap_size, which can control the addition if necessary. See
growfs(7) for details.

The zfskeys startup script supports autoloading of keys stored on ZFS.
2411090f6940 (Sponsored by Klara Inc.)

A new RC script, zpoolreguid has been added, which will assign a new
GUID to one or more zpools, useful for virtualization environments when
sharing datasets.

The hostid startup script will now generate a random (version 4) UUID if
there is no /etc/hostid file and no valid UUID from hardware. Also, if
there is no /etc/machine-id file, the hostid_save script will store a
compact version of the hostid (one without hyphens) in /etc/machine-id.
This file is used by libraries such as GLib. 17333d92643d a379d5c5efb2
71d88613d129

It is now possible to add default routes for FIBs other than the primary
by using the defaultrouter_fibN and ipv6_defaultrouter_fibN rc.conf(5)
variables. c6ec1b441ad3 (Sponsored by ScaleEngine Inc.)

Userland Application Changes

The bhyve(8) utility has gained virtio-input device emulation support.
This will be used to inject keyboard/mouse input events into a guest.
The command line syntax is: -s <slot>,virtio-input,/dev/input/eventX.
6192776124c5

The kdump(1) utility has gained support for decoding Linux system calls.

The killall(1) utility now allows sending signals to processes with
their controlling terminal on pts(4) using the syntax -t pts/N.
a76fa7bb6cb7

An nproc(1) utility has been added, compatible with the Linux program of
the same name.

The timeout(1) utility has been moved from /usr/bin to /bin.

The pciconf(8) utility has added support for decoding ACS extended
capability. dde4103a465b (Sponsored by Chelsio Communications)

The procstat(1) utility can now print information about advisory locks
on files with the newly added advlock command. f9daaf452a8a

The pwd_mkdb(8) utility no longer copies comments from
/etc/master.passwd to /etc/passwd. 3e955733117d

MSS clamping has been improved for ppp(8). 301bff9bdd62

Metric aliasing has been changed in prometheus_sysctl_exporter(8) to
avoid confusing Prometheus server due to conflicting metric names. The
tcp_log_bucket UMA zone has been renamed to tcp_log_id_bucket, and
tcp_log_node was renamed to tcp_log_id_node for consistency. Sysctl
variables with (LEGACY) in their descriptions are no longer being
exported, these are used by ZFS sysctls that have been replaced by
others, many of which alias to the same Prometheus metric name (like
vfs.zfs.arc_max and vfs.zfs.arc.max). e4f508d5a211 (Sponsored by
Axcient)

The uuidgen(1) utility has a new option -r to generate a random UUID,
version 4. 8fd1953b7eb2

When invoked by inetd(8), ctlstat -P will now produce output suitable
for ingestion into Prometheus; see ctlstat(8). f7896015fcde (Sponsored
by Axcient)

kdump(1).

The native pthread library functions can now support Linux semantics.

Kernel

This section covers changes to kernel configurations, system tuning, and
system control parameters that are not otherwise categorized.

General Kernel Changes

The bhyve(8) hypervisor and kernel module vmm(4) now support more than
16 vCPUs in a guest. By default bhyve permits each guest to create the
same number of vCPUs as the count of physical CPUs on the host. This
limit can be adjusted via the loader tunable hw.vmm.maxcpu. 3e02f8809aec

Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) is enabled for 64-bit
executables by default. It can be disabled as needed if applications
fail unexpectedly, for example with segmentation faults. To disable for
a single invocation, use the proccontrol(1) command:
proccontrol -m aslr -s disable command. To disable ASLR for all
invocations of a binary, use the elfctl(1) command:
elfctl -e +noaslr file. Problems should be reported via the problem
reporting system, https://bugs.freebsd.org, or posting to the
freebsd-stable@FreeBSD.org mailing list. 10192e77cfac (Sponsored by
Stormshield)

A workaround has been implemented for a hardware page invalidation
problem on Intel Alder Lake (twelfth generation) and Raptor Lake
(thirteenth generation) hybrid CPUs. The bug can lead to file system
corruption with UFS and MSDOSFS, and probably other memory corruption.
The slower cores (E-cores) automatically use a slower method of page
invalidation with the workaround. 567cc4e6bfd9 (Sponsored by The FreeBSD
Foundation)

A new kernel configuration knob is available, SPLIT_KERNEL_DEBUG, which
controls splitting of kernel and module debug data into separate
standalone files. This interacts with the WITHOUT_KERNEL_SYMBOLS option,
which operates differently than in 13.0-RELEASE and 13.1-RELEASE, but
similarly to prior releases; it now controls only installation of the
debug data. The defaults are WITH_KERNEL_SYMBOLS and
WITH_SPLIT_KERNEL_DEBUG, allowing the kernel and modules without debug
data to be installed in /boot, and standalone debugging files to be
installed in /usr/lib/debug, as was done by default in releases before
13.0-RELEASE. Using WITHOUT_KERNEL_SYMBOLS and WITH_SPLIT_KERNEL_DEBUG,
standalone debugging files are generated but not installed, as when
using WITHOUT_KERNEL_SYMBOLS in releases before 13.0-RELEASE. Finally,
using WITHOUT_KERNEL_SYMBOLS and WITHOUT_SPLIT_KERNEL_DEBUG installs the
kernel and modules with built-in debugging information in /boot, as in
13.1-RELEASE using WITHOUT_KERNEL_SYMBOLS. 0c4d13c521aa (Sponsored by
The FreeBSD Foundation)

On the PowerPC, a radix pmap in pseries is supported for ISA 3.0. This
should make pseries significantly faster on POWER9 instances, as fewer
hypercalls are needed to manage pmap now. c74c77531248

Support for ptrace(2) is now available for Linux processes on arm64.
99950e8beb72

In order to facilitate ABI compatibility of stable branches, the CPU
affinity system calls are now more tolerant of CPU sets that are smaller
than used by the kernel. This will facilitate increases to the size of
the kernel set, MAXCPU. 72bc1e6806cc

64-bit linux(4) ABI support was added for saving CPU floating point
state across signal delivery. 0b82c544de58, 20d601714206

vDSO (virtual dynamic shared object) support has been nearly completed
in the linux(4) ABI. a340b5b4bd48

The state of the arm64 linux(4) ABI was brought to parity with the amd64
linux(4) ABI. 0b82c544de58, a340b5b4bd48

Devices and Drivers

This section covers changes and additions to devices and device drivers
since 13.1-RELEASE.

Device Drivers

The em(4) driver now correctly supports the full range of receive buffer
sizes available on newer chips 82580 and i350. 3f8306cf8e2d

The ena(4) driver has been upgraded to version 2.6.2. (Sponsored by
Amazon, Inc.)

Basic support for Intel Alder Lake CPUs has been implemented for
hwpmc(4). b8ef2ca9eae9

The ice(4) driver has been updated to version 1.37.7-k.

The irdma(4) RDMA driver was introduced for the Intel E810 Ethernet
Controller, supporting both RoCEv2 and iWARP protocols in per-PF manner,
RoCEv2 being the default, and was upgraded to version 1.1.5-k.
42bad04a2156 (Sponsored by Intel Corporation)

Initial support is now available for DPAA2 (second generation Data Path
Acceleration Architecture – a hardware-level networking architecture
found in some NXP SoCs). It runs NXP-supplied firmware which provides
DPAA2 objects as an abstraction layer, and provides a dpni network
interface. d5a64a935bc9 (Sponsored by Bare Enthusiasm :) and Traverse
Technologies)

The iwlwifi(4) driver for Intel wireless interfaces was updated.
(Sponsored by The FreeBSD Foundation)

The rtw88(4) driver was added to support several Realtek wireless PCI
interfaces. It is currently limited to 802.11 a/b/g operation. See
https://wiki.freebsd.org/WiFi/Rtw88 for additional information.

There were many additions and improvements to the KPI for support of
Linux device drivers. (Sponsored by The FreeBSD Foundation)

Storage

This section covers changes and additions to file systems and other
storage subsystems, both local and networked.

NFS Changes

A problem causing NFS server hangs has been fixed; the problem was
caused by a bug with SACK handling in TCP.

UFS Changes

It is now possible to take snapshots on UFS filesystems when running
with journaled soft updates. Thus it is now possible to do background
dumps on live filesystems running with journaled soft updates.
Background dumps are requested by using the -L flag to dump(8). (In
previous releases UFS snapshots were incompatible with journaled soft
updates.) 3f908eed27b4 (Sponsored by The FreeBSD Foundation)

Boot Loader Changes

This section covers the boot loader, boot menu, and other boot-related
changes.

Boot Loader Changes

The teken.fg_color and teken.bg_color loader.conf(5) variables now
accept a bright or light prefix (and color numbers 8 through 15) to
select bright colors. 1dcb6002c500 (Sponsored by The FreeBSD
Foundation). See also 233ab015c0d7

Several bugs have been fixed in loader(8) that caused the video console
output to disappear. These appeared to be hangs after the boot loader
starts the kernel. (Sponsored by Netflix)

Networking

This section describes changes that affect networking in FreeBSD.

General Network

The kernel wg(4) WireGuard driver has been reintegrated; it provides
Virtual Private Network (VPN) interfaces using the WireGuard protocol.
5ae69e2f10da (Sponsored by Rubicon Communications, LLC ("Netgate") and
The FreeBSD Foundation)

KTLS (the kernel TLS implementation) has added receive offload support
for TLS 1.3. Receive offload is now supported for TLS 1.1 through 1.3;
send offload is supported for TLS 1.0 through 1.3. 1462dc95f796
(Sponsored by Netflix)

The netlink(4) network configuration protocol is now available. It is a
communication protocol defined in RFC 3549, and uses a raw socket to
exchange configuration information between user space and kernel. It is
used by third-party routing programs and by the linux(4) ABI. The
netlink(4) protocol is not included in the GENERIC configuration in
13.2-RELEASE, but is available as a kernel module. 6058f6cc48f5

Radix tables and lookups are now supported for MAC addresses in ipfw(4).
This allows MAC address tables to be constructed and used for filtering.
c31f8b7bd895

Kernel modules dpdk_lpm4 and dpdk_lpm6 are now available and can be
loaded via loader.conf(5). They provide optimized routing functions for
hosts with a very large amount of routing tables. They can be configured
via route(8) and are part of the modular FIB lookup mechanism.
0ca122044369

There are numerous bug fixes in TCP and SCTP.

General Notes Regarding Future FreeBSD Releases

OPIE has been deprecated and will be removed in FreeBSD 14.0.

The ce(4) and cp(4) synchronous serial drivers have been deprecated and
will be removed in FreeBSD 14.0.

Drivers for ISA sound cards have been deprecated and will be removed in
FreeBSD 14.0. d7620b6ec941 (Sponsored by The FreeBSD Foundation)

The mergemaster(8) utility has been deprecated and will be removed in
FreeBSD 14.0. Its replacement is etcupdate(8). 5fa16e3c50c5 (Sponsored
by The FreeBSD Foundation)

The minigzip(1) utility has been deprecated and will be removed in
FreeBSD 14.0. 84d3fc26e3a2

The remaining components of ATM in netgraph (NgATM) have been deprecated
and will be removed in FreeBSD 14.0. Support for ATM NICs was removed
previously.

The Telnet daemon, telnetd(8), has been deprecated and will be removed
in FreeBSD 14.0. The Telnet client is not affected.

The VINUM class in geom(8) has been deprecated and will be removed in a
future release.

Default CPUTYPE Change

Starting with FreeBSD-13.0, the default CPUTYPE for the i386
architecture will change from 486 to 686.

This means that, by default, binaries produced will require a 686-class
CPU, including but not limited to binaries provided by the FreeBSD
Release Engineering team. FreeBSD 13.x will continue to support older
CPUs, however users needing this functionality will need to build their
own releases for official support.

As the primary use for i486 and i586 CPUs is generally in the embedded
market, the general end-user impact is expected to be minimal, as new
hardware with these CPU types has long faded, and much of the deployed
base of such systems is nearing retirement age, statistically.

There were several factors taken into account for this change. For
example, i486 does not have 64-bit atomics, and while they can be
emulated in the kernel, they cannot be emulated in the userland.
Additionally, the 32-bit amd64 libraries have been i686 since their
inception.

As the majority of 32-bit testing is done by developers using the lib32
libraries on 64-bit hardware with the COMPAT_FREEBSD32 option in the
kernel, this change ensures better coverage and user experience. This
also aligns with what the majority of Linux® distributions have been
doing for quite some time.

This is expected to be the final bump of the default CPUTYPE in i386.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | This change does not affect the   |
|                                   | FreeBSD 12.x series of releases.  |
