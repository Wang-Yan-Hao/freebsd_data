FreeBSD 9.0-RELEASE Release Notes

  Important: If you are upgrading from a previous release of FreeBSD,
  please read upgrading section in the Release Notes for notable
  incompatibilities carefully.

Release Highlights

The highlights in the 9.0-RELEASE are the following. For more details,
please see the Detailed Release Notes.

-   The FreeBSD kernel now supports Capsicum Capability Mode. Capsicum
    is a set of features for sandboxing support, using a capability
    model in which the capabilities are file descriptors. Two new kernel
    options CAPABILITIES and CAPABILITY_MODE have been added to the
    GENERIC kernel. For more information about Capsicum, see
    http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/capsicum/.[r219129]

-   The hhook(9) (Helper Hook) and khelp(9) (Kernel Helpers) KPIs have
    been implemented. These are a kind of superset of pfil(9) framework
    for more general use in the kernel. The hhook(9) KPI provides a way
    for kernel subsystems to export hook points that khelp(9) modules
    can hook to provide enhanced or new functionality to the kernel. The
    khelp(9) KPI provides a framework for managing khelp(9) modules,
    which indirectly use the hhook(9) KPI to register their hook
    functions with hook points of interest within the kernel. These
    allow a structured way to dynamically extend the kernel at runtime
    in an ABI preserving manner.[r216758, r216615]

-   A new resource accounting API has been implemented. It can keep
    per-process, per-jail, and per-loginclass resource accounting
    information. Note that this is not built nor installed by default.
    To build and install them, specify options RACCT in the kernel
    configuration file and rebuild the base system as described in the
    FreeBSD Handbook.[r220137]

-   A new resource-limiting API has been implemented. It works in
    conjunction with the RACCT resource accounting implementation and
    takes user-configurable actions based on the set of rules it
    maintains and the current resource usage. The rctl(8) utility has
    been added to manage the rules in userland. Note that this is not
    built nor installed by default. To build and install them, specify
    options RCTL in the kernel configuration file and rebuild the base
    system as described in the FreeBSD Handbook.[r220163]

-   [powerpc] FreeBSD/powerpc now supports Sony Playstation 3 using the
    OtherOS feature available on firmwares 3.15 and earlier.[r217044]

-   [amd64, i386] The FreeBSD usb(4) subsystem now supports USB 3.0 by
    default.[r223098]

-   The FreeBSD usb(4) subsystem now supports USB packet filter. This
    allows to capture packets which go through each USB host controller.
    The implementation is almost based on bpf(4) code. The userland
    program usbdump(8) has been added.[r215649]

-   A bxe(4) driver for Broadcom NetXtreme II 10GbE controllers
    (BCM57710, BCM57711, BCM57711E) has been added.[r219647]

-   A cxgbe(4) driver for Chelsio T4 (Terminator 4) based 10Gb/1Gb
    adapters has been added.[r218794]

-   The em(4) driver has been updated to version 7.3.2.[r219753]

-   The igb(4) driver has been updated to version 2.2.5.[r223350]

-   The igb(4) driver now supports Intel I350 PCIe Gigabit Ethernet
    controllers.[r218530]

-   The ixgbe(4) driver has been updated to version 2.3.8.[r217593]

-   The re(4) driver now supports RTL8168E/8111E-VL PCIe Gigabit
    Ethernet controllers and RTL8401E PCIe Fast Ethernet
    controllers.[r217498, r218760]

-   A vte(4) driver for RDC R6040 Fast Ethernet controllers, which are
    commonly found on the Vortex86 System On a Chip, has been
    added.[r216829]

-   A vxge(4) driver for the Neterion X3100 10GbE Server/Storage adapter
    has been added.[r221167]

-   ipfw(8) now supports IPv6 in the fwd action.[r225044]

-   ipfw(8) now supports the call and return actions. Upon the
    call number action, the current rule number is saved in the internal
    stack and ruleset processing continues with the first rule numbered
    number or higher. The return action takes the rule number saved to
    internal stack by the latest call action and returns ruleset
    processing to the first rule with number greater than that saved
    number.[r223666]

-   For Infiniband support, OFED (OpenFabrics Enterprise Distribution)
    version 1.5.3 has been imported into the base system. Note that this
    is not built nor installed by default. To build and install them,
    specify WITH_OFED=yes in /etc/src.conf and rebuild the base system
    as described in the FreeBSD Handbook.[r219820]

-   The FreeBSD TCP/IP network stack now supports IPv4 prefixes with /31
    as described in RFC 3021, “Using 31-Bit Prefixes on IPv4
    Point-to-Point Links”.[r226572]

-   The FreeBSD TCP/IP network stack now supports the mod_cc(9)
    pluggable congestion control framework. This allows TCP congestion
    control algorithms to be implemented as dynamically loadable kernel
    modules. The following kernel modules are available as of
    9.0-RELEASE: cc_chd(4) for the CAIA-Hamilton-Delay algorithm,
    cc_cubic(4) for the CUBIC algorithm, cc_hd(4) for the Hamilton-Delay
    algorithm, cc_htcp(4) for the H-TCP algorithm, cc_newreno(4) for the
    NewReno algorithm, and cc_vegas(4) for the Vegas algorithm. The
    default algorithm can be set by a new sysctl(8) variable
    net.inet.tcp.cc.algorithm. The value must be set to one of the names
    listed by net.inet.tcp.cc.available, and newreno is the default set
    at boot time. For more detail, see the mod_cc(4) and mod_cc(9)
    manual pages.[r216109, r216114, r216115, r218152, r218153, r218155]

-   An h_ertt(4) (Enhanced Round Trip Time) khelp(9) module has been
    added. This module allows per-connection, low noise estimates of the
    instantaneous RTT in the TCP/IP network stack with a robust
    implementation even in the face of delayed acknowledgments and/or
    TSO (TCP Segmentation Offload) being in use for a
    connection.[r217806]

-   A new tcp(4) socket option TCP_CONGESTION has been added. This
    allows to select or query the congestion control algorithm that the
    TCP/IP network stack will use for connections on the
    socket.[r218912]

-   The ng_netflow(4) netgraph(4) node now supports NetFlow version 9. A
    new export9 hook has been added for NetFlow v9 data. Note that data
    export can be done simultaneously in both version 5 and version
    9.[r219183]

-   The geom_map(4) GEOM class has been added. This allows to generate
    multiple geom providers based on a hard-coded layout of a device
    with no explicit partition table such as embedded flash storage. For
    more information, see the geom_map(4) manual page.[r220559]

-   The graid(8) GEOM class has been added. This is a replacement of the
    ataraid(4) driver supporting various BIOS-based software
    RAID.[r219974]

-   A tws(4) driver for 3ware 9750 SATA+SAS 6Gb/s RAID controllers has
    been added.[r226115]

-   The FreeBSD Fast File System now supports softupdates journaling. It
    introduces a intent log into a softupdates-enabled file system which
    eliminates the need for background fsck(8) even on unclean shutdown.
    This can be enabled in a per-filesystem basis by using the -j flag
    of the newfs(8) utility or the -j enable option of the tunefs(8)
    utility. Note that the 9.0-RELEASE installer automatically enables
    softupdates journaling for newly-created UFS file systems.[r207141,
    r218726]

-   The FreeBSD Fast File System now supports the TRIM command when
    freeing data blocks. A new flag -t in the newfs(8) and tunefs(8)
    utilities sets the TRIM-enable flag for a file system. The
    TRIM-enable flag makes the file system send a delete request to the
    underlying device for each freed block. The TRIM command is
    specified as a Data Set Management Command in the ATA8-ACS2 standard
    to carry the information related to deleted data blocks to a device,
    especially for a SSD (Solid-State Drive) for optimization.[r216796]

-   The FreeBSD NFS subsystem has been updated. The new implementation
    supports NFS version 4 in addition to 2 and 3. The kernel options
    for the NFS server and client are changed from NFSSERVER and
    NFSCLIENT to NFSD and NFSCL. sysctl(8) variables which start with
    vfs.nfssrv. have been renamed to vfs.nfsd.. The NFS server now
    supports vfs.nfsd.server_max_nfsvers and vfs.nfsd.server_min_nfsvers
    sysctl(8) variables to specify the maximum and the minimum NFS
    version number which the server accepts. The default value is set to
    3 and 2, respectively.[r221124]

-   The FreeBSD ZFS subsystem has been updated to the SPA (Storage Pool
    Allocator, also known as zpool) version 28. It now supports data
    deduplication, triple parity RAIDZ (raidz3), snapshot holds, log
    device removal, zfs diff, zpool split, zpool import -F, and
    read-only zpool import.[r219089]

-   An implementation of iconv() API libraries and utilities which are
    standardized in Single UNIX Specification has been imported. These
    are based on NetBSD's Citrus implementation. Note that these are not
    built nor installed by default. To build and install them, specify
    WITH_ICONV=yes in /etc/src.conf and rebuild the base system as
    described in the FreeBSD Handbook.[r219019]

-   A readline(3) API set has been imported into libedit. This is based
    on NetBSD's implementation and BSD licensed utilities now use it
    instead of GNU libreadline.[r220370]

-   The rtsold(8) and rtadvd(8) daemons now support the RDNSS and DNSSL
    options described in RFC 6106, “IPv6 Router Advertisement Options
    for DNS Configuration”. A rtadvctl(8) utility to control the
    rtadvd(8) daemon has been added.[r222732, r224006]

-   The rtld(1) runtime linker now supports shared objects as filters in
    ELF shared libraries. Both standard and auxiliary filtering have
    been supported. The rtld(1) linker's processing of a filter defers
    loading a filtee until a filter symbol is referenced unless the
    LD_LOADFLTR environment variable is defined or a -z loadfltr option
    was specified when the filter was created.[r216695]

-   A bug in the tftpd(8) daemon has been fixed. It had an
    interoperability issue when transferring a large file.[r224536]

-   The utmp(5) user accounting database has been replaced by utmpx(3).
    User accounting utilities will now use utmpx database files
    exclusively. The wtmpcvt(1) utility can be used to convert wtmp
    files to the new format, making it possible to read them using the
    updated utilities.[r202188]

-   The zpool(8): utility now supports a zpool labelclear command. This
    allows to wipe the label data from a drive that is not active in a
    pool.[r224171]

A list of all platforms currently under development can be found on the
Supported Platforms page.
