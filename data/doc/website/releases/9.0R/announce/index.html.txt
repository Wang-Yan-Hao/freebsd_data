    and five congestion control algorithm implementations available

-   NFS subsystem updated, new implementation supports NFSv4 in addition
    to NFSv3 and NFSv2

Dedication

The FreeBSD Project dedicates the FreeBSD 9.0-RELEASE to the memory of
Dennis M. Ritchie, one of the founding fathers of the UNIX[tm] operating
system. It is on the foundation laid by the work of visionaries like
Dennis that software like the FreeBSD operating system came to be. The
fact that his work of so many years ago continues to influence new
design decisions to this very day speaks for the brilliant engineer that
he was.

May he rest in peace.

Availability

FreeBSD 9.0-RELEASE is now available for the amd64, i386, ia64, powerpc,
powerpc64, and sparc64 architectures.

FreeBSD 9.0 can be installed from bootable ISO images or over the
network. Some architectures also support installing from a USB memory
stick. The required files can be downloaded via FTP or BitTorrent as
described in the sections below. While some of the smaller FTP mirrors
may not carry all architectures, they will all generally contain the
more common ones such as amd64 and i386.

NOTE: A problem was discovered with the DVD images for amd64 and i386
architectures shortly after they were loaded on the FTP distribution
server. Those images have since been replaced and we have allowed enough
time that the newer images should have distributed to all the FTP
servers that carry the release. If you downloaded the amd64 or i386 DVD
images prior to this announcement it would be a good idea to verify the
checksums of the image you downloaded with the checksums provided as
part of this Release Announcement. The only thing wrong with the images
that were replaced is that sysinstall(8) can not be used to install the
pre-built packages on the DVD. Other than that there is nothing
different on the updated images. The bad DVD images were never available
on BitTorrent.

MD5 and SHA256 hashes for the release ISO images are included at the
bottom of this message.

The purpose of the images provided as part of the release are as
follows:

dvd1

    This contains everything necessary to install the base FreeBSD
    operating system, a collection of pre-built packages aimed at
    getting a graphical workstation up and running. It also supports
    booting into a "livefs" based rescue mode. This should be all you
    need if you can burn and use DVD-sized media.

disc1

    This contains the base FreeBSD operating system. It also supports
    booting into a "livefs" based rescue mode. There are no pre-built
    packages.

bootonly

    This supports booting a machine using the CDROM drive but does not
    contain the support for installing FreeBSD from the CD itself. You
    would need to perform a network based install (e.g. from an FTP
    server) after booting from the CD.

memstick

    This can be written to an USB memory stick (flash drive) and used to
    do an install on machines capable of booting off USB drives. It also
    supports booting into a "livefs" based rescue mode. There are no
    pre-built packages.

    As one example of how to use the memstick image, assuming the USB
    drive appears as /dev/da0 on your machine something like this should
    work:

        # dd if="FreeBSD"-9.0-RELEASE-amd64-memstick.img of=/dev/da0 bs="10240" conv="sync"

    Be careful to make sure you get the target (of=) correct.

FreeBSD 9.0-RELEASE can also be purchased on CD-ROM or DVD from several
vendors. One of the vendors that will be offering FreeBSD 9.0-based
products is:

-   FreeBSD Mall, Inc. http://www.freebsdmall.com/

BitTorrent

9.0-RELEASE ISOs are available via BitTorrent. A collection of torrent
files to download the images is available at:

-   http://torrents.FreeBSD.org:8080/

Other Projects Based on FreeBSD

There are many "third party" Projects based on FreeBSD. The Projects
range from re-packaging FreeBSD into a more "novice friendly"
distribution to making FreeBSD available on Amazon's EC2 infrastructure.
For more information about these Third Party Projects see:

-   http://wiki.freebsd.org/3rdPartyProjects
