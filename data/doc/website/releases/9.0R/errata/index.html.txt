  This document lists errata items for FreeBSD 9.0-RELEASE, containing
  significant information discovered after the release or too late in
  the release cycle to be otherwise included in the release
  documentation. This information includes security advisories, as well
  as news relating to the software or documentation that could affect
  its operation or usability. An up-to-date version of this document
  should always be consulted before installing this version of FreeBSD.

  This errata document for FreeBSD 9.0-RELEASE will be maintained until
  the release of FreeBSD 9.1-RELEASE.

1 Introduction

This errata document contains “late-breaking news” about FreeBSD
9.0-RELEASE. Before installing this version, it is important to consult
this document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems
that may already have been found and fixed.

Any version of this errata document actually distributed with the
release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be out of date by
definition, but other copies are kept updated on the Internet and should
be consulted as the “current errata” for this release. These other
copies of the errata are located at http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/,
plus any sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.

Source and binary snapshots of FreeBSD 9.0-STABLE also contain
up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of the snapshot).

For a list of all FreeBSD CERT security advisories, see
http://www.FreeBSD.org/security/ or

3 Open Issues

-   In some releases prior to 9.0-RELEASE, upgrading by using
    freebsd-update(8) can fail. This issue has been fixed by a change in
    Errata Notice EN-12:01. For more information, see
    http://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-EN-12:01.freebsd-update.asc

-   [amd64, i386] FreeBSD 9.0-RELEASE includes several changes to
    improve resource management of PCI devices. Some x86 machines may
    not boot or may have devices that no longer attach when using ACPI
    as a result of these changes. This can be worked around by setting a
    loader(8) tunable debug.acpi.disabled to hostres. To do this, enter
    the following lines at the loader prompt:

        set debug.acpi.disabled="hostres"
        boot

    Or, put the following line into /boot/loader.conf:

        debug.acpi.disabled="hostres"

-   A devctl(4) event upon arrival of a ugen(4) device has been changed.
    The event now includes ugen and cdev variables instead of
    device-name. This change can prevent the following devd(8) rule
    which worked in a previous releases from working:

        attach 0 {
            match "device-name" "ugen[0-9]+.[0-9]+";
            action "/path/to/script /dev/$device-name";
        }

    This should be updated to the following:

        attach 0 {
            match "subsystem" "DEVICE";
            match "type" "ATTACH";
            match "cdev" "ugen[0-9]+.[0-9]+";
            action "/path/to/script /dev/$cdev";
        }

-   The FreeBSD 9.0-RELEASE Release Notes should have mentioned that SSM
    (Source-Specific Multicast) MLDv2 now uses ALLOW_NEW_SOURCES and
    BLOCK_OLD_SOURCES record types to signal a join or a leave by
    default. This conforms RFC 4604, “Using Internet Group Management
    Protocol Version 3 (IGMPv3) and Multicast Listener Discovery
    Protocol Version 2 (MLDv2) for Source-Specific Multicast”. A new
    sysctl(8) variable net.inet6.mld.use_allow which controls the
    behavior has been added. The default value is 1 (use
    ALLOW_NEW_SOURCES and BLOCK_OLD_SOURCES).

-   9.0-RELEASE fails to configure an interface specified in the
    rc.conf(5) variable ipv6_prefix_IF when the interface does not have
    a corresponding ifconfig_IF_ipv6 variable. This problem will be
    fixed in the future releases. To work around this problem on
    9.0-RELEASE, add an ifconfig_IF_ipv6 line for each interface
    specified in ipv6_prefix_IF as the following:

        ipv6_prefix_em0="2001:db8:1:0 2001:db8:2:0"
        ifconfig_em0_ipv6="inet6 auto_linklocal"

-   In 9.0-RELEASE the FreeBSD USB subsystem supports USB 3.0 by the
    xhci(4) driver. However, a bug that could prevent it from working
    with a USB 3.0 hub has been found and fixed after the release date.
    This means 9.0-RELEASE and prior do not work with a USB 3.0 hub.
    This problem has been fixed in HEAD and will be merged into the
    9-STABLE branch.
