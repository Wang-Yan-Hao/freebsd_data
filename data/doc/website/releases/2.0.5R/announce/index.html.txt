FreeBSD 2.0.5 RELEASE Announcement

Date: Sat, 10 Jun 1995 13:01:12 -0700
From: "Jordan K. Hubbard" <jkh@freefall.cdrom.com>
To: announce@freefall.cdrom.com, hackers@freefall.cdrom.com
Subject: Announcing FreeBSD 2.0.5 RELEASE!

It is my usual pleasure (and, to a small degree, relief! :) to announce
the release of FreeBSD 2.0.5R - the final release in the 2.0.5 series.

This release provides both what I hope will be an exciting glimpse of
some of the new technologies and directions we have planned for 2.1R and
a stable and much easier-to-install alternative to 2.0R.

Highlights of this release are:

-   Multi-lingual documentation files.

-   Completely menu driven installation.

-   More installation media types.

-   Support for a much larger range of PC hardware.

-   Easy mounting of DOS partitions and CD devices mounted
    automatically.

-   "Canned" installation types for easy installs.

-   Easy post-configuration menu

And many other new features and bug fixes.

The ports and packages collection has also been bundled with 2.0.5R to
prevent synchronization errors. While this does result in a larger
overall distribution, it at least ensures more consistent results when
installing ports and packages.

More information on the release may be found in the RELNOTES and README
files, so I’ll simply leave you all to see for yourself!

The usual locations:

-   ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/2.0.5-RELEASE

-   ftp://freefall.cdrom.com/pub/FreeBSD/2.0.5-RELEASE

As well as the usual mirrors, once they pick it up.

It is also available on CD from Walnut Creek CDROM, the project’s
principle sponsors. Please see the release notes for ordering
information.

Any feedback should be sent to hackers@FreeBSD.org. I will be leaving
the country shortly (about 3 hours :) and will try to read my email as
often as possible, but for quicker replies please send to the mailing
list.

Thank you!

Jordan

From: Gary Palmer <gpalmer@westhill.cdrom.com>
To: announce@FreeBSD.ORGD
Subject: 2.0.5-RELEASE update

Yes, you have guessed it. As a result of the recent feedback we have had
about the original 2.0.5-RELEASE, we have gone poking and found a couple
of bugs on the original boot.flp image. There is now a
/pub/FreeBSD/2.0.5-RELEASE/UPDATES directory on ftp.cdrom.com and
freefall.cdrom.com with a version of boot.flp which will fix the
following problems:

-   The kernel was too big to boot on 4Mb machines.

-   It was possible to specify the filesystem mount points in such a way
    that the program would mount the filesystem before the parent
    filesystem was mounted (e.g. it would mount /usr/local and then
    /usr)

As the CDROM has not gone to replication yet, this updated floppy image
will be appearing on the CDROM.

Sorry to all those who had problems with the first boot floppy set - I
will personally nail Jordan to his chair and nail the chair to the floor
in front of his computer the next time we roll a release!
