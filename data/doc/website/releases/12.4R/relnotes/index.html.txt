FreeBSD 12.4-RELEASE Release Notes

Abstract

The release notes for FreeBSD 12.4-RELEASE contain a summary of the
changes made to the FreeBSD base system on the 12-STABLE development
line. This document lists applicable security advisories that were
issued since the last release, as well as significant changes to the
FreeBSD kernel and userland. Some brief remarks on upgrading are also
presented.

Introduction

This document contains the release notes for FreeBSD 12.4-RELEASE. It
describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of FreeBSD. It
also provides some notes on upgrading from previous versions of FreeBSD.

The release distribution to which these release notes apply represents
the latest point along the 12-STABLE development branch since 12-STABLE
was created. Information regarding pre-built, binary release
distributions along this branch can be found at
https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/.

The release distribution to which these release notes apply represents a
point along the 12-STABLE development branch since 12.3-RELEASE. The
12.4-RELEASE is expected to be the final release from the 12-STABLE
branch. Information regarding pre-built, binary release distributions
along this branch can be found at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/.

This distribution of FreeBSD 12.4-RELEASE is a release distribution. It
can be found at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/ or any of its mirrors.
More information on obtaining this (or other) release distributions of
FreeBSD can be found in the Obtaining FreeBSD appendix to the FreeBSD
Handbook.

All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before installing
FreeBSD. The errata document is updated with "late-breaking" information
discovered late in the release cycle or after the release. Typically, it
contains information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections
to documentation. An up-to-date copy of the errata for FreeBSD
12.4-RELEASE can be found on the FreeBSD Web site.

This document describes the most user-visible new or changed features in
FreeBSD since 12.3-RELEASE. In general, changes described here are
unique to the 12-STABLE branch unless specifically marked as MERGED
features.

Typical release note items document recent security advisories issued
after 12.3-RELEASE, new drivers or hardware support, new commands or
options, major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades. They may
also list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering
practices. Clearly the release notes cannot list every single change
made to FreeBSD between releases; this document focuses primarily on
security advisories, user-visible changes, and major architectural
improvements.

Upgrading from Previous Releases of FreeBSD

Binary upgrades between RELEASE versions (and snapshots of the various
security branches) are supported using the freebsd-update(8) utility.
The binary upgrade procedure will update unmodified userland utilities,
as well as unmodified GENERIC kernels distributed as a part of an
official FreeBSD release. The freebsd-update(8) utility requires that
the host being upgraded have Internet connectivity.

Source-based upgrades (those based on recompiling the FreeBSD base
system from source code) from previous versions are supported, according
to the instructions in /usr/src/UPDATING.

Userland

This section covers changes and additions to userland applications,
contributed software, and system utilities.

Userland Application Changes
