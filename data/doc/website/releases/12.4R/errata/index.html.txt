Introduction

This errata document contains "late-breaking news" about FreeBSD
12.4-RELEASE. Before installing this version, it is important to consult
this document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems
that may already have been found and fixed.

Any version of this errata document actually distributed with the
release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be out of date by
definition, but other copies are kept updated on the Internet and should
be consulted as the "current errata" for this release. These other
copies of the errata are located at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/,
plus any sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.

Source and binary snapshots of FreeBSD 12-STABLE also contain up-to-date
copies of this document (as of the time of the snapshot).

For a list of all FreeBSD CERT security advisories, see
https://www.FreeBSD.org/security/.

Open Issues

If upgrading from an earlier version of FreeBSD, sshd (from OpenSSH
9.1p1) will not accept new connections until it is restarted. After
installing the new userland, either reboot (as specified in the source
update procedure), or execute service sshd restart.
