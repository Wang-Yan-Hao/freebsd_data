    command will be issued on supported devices when deleting data.
    r238500

-   The MULTIPATH geom(4) class has been updated. It now supports
    Active/Active mode, Active/Read mode as hybrid of Active/Active and
    Active/Passive, keeping a failed path without removing the geom
    provider, manual configuration without on-disk metadata, and add,

    r230920, r231679, r237876

-   The usb(4) storage device driver now enables power save mode by
    default. r229107

-   The FreeBSD NFS filesystem has been improved:

    -   It now supports a timeout on positive name cache entries on the
        client side. A new mount option nametimeo has been added and set
        to 60 (in seconds) by default. r233326

    -   A memory leak when a ZFS volume is exported via the FreeBSD NFS
        server has been fixed. r234740

    -   A bug has been fixed. When a process writes to an mmap-backed
        file on an NFS filesystem, flushing changes to the data could
        fail under some circumstances such as errors due to permission
        mismatch, and this failure could not detected as an error. A new
        sysctl(8) variable vfs.nfs.nfs_keep_dirty_on_error has been
        added to control the behavior on the client side related to this
        issue. When this is set to 1, the pages where a write operation
        failed are kept dirty. The default value is set to 0. r233730

    -   The nfsv4(4) filesystem now supports a sysctl(8) variable
        vfs.nfsd.disable_checkutf8. This disables the check for UTF-8
        compliance in the filenames. This is disabled by default. Note
        that enabling this may help some interoperability issues but
        results in an NFSv4 server that is non-RFC 3530 compliant.
        r229799

-   The tmpfs(5) filesystem is not an experimental implementation
    anymore. r234511

-   The tmpfs(5) filesystem now supports a sysctl(8) variable
    vfs.tmpfs.memory_reserved to set the amount of required free pages
    when tmpfs(5) attempts to allocate a new node. r234849

-   FreeBSD ZFS filesystem has been updated by merging improvements from
    illumos project. The following changes are made: r229578, r232328

    -   New properties, clones and written, have been added.

    -   The zfs(8) send command now reports an estimated size of the
        stream.

    -   The zfs(8) destroy command now reports an estimate of the space
        which would be reclaimed, when -n flag is specified.

    -   The zfs(8) get command now supports the -t type flag to specify
        the data type.

-   The dhclient(8) utility now supports domain-search (option number
    119, described in RFC 3397). This allows a DHCP server to publish a
    list of implicit domain suffixes used during name lookup. If this
    option is specified, a search keyword will be added to
    /etc/resolv.conf. r230597

-   A bug in the gcc(1) compiler has been fixed. It could lead to
    incorrect calculations when -ffast-math is specified. r234023

-   The ifconfig(8) utility now supports a vlanhwcsum parameter to set
    or reset checksum offloading capability on VLANs. r231221

-   The ifconfig(8) utility now supports a carp state parameter to set
    the state to backup or master forcibly. r232486

-   The jail(8) utility now supports a configuration file (jail.conf(5))
    for complex configurations. r235839

-   Lock handling performance in the libthr pthread library has been
    improved. It now works 10 times faster especially under the
    condition that a mutex is heavily contested. r234372

-   A new C++ stack has been imported. This consists of libcxxrt,
    originally developed by a FreeBSD developer under contract by
    PathScale and open sourced by the FreeBSD and NetBSD foundations,
    and libc++ from the LLVM project. libcxxrt is a drop-in replacement
    for GNU libsupc++, which implements the C++ runtime support for
    features such as run-time type information, dynamic casting,
    thread-safe static initializer, and exceptions. libc++ implements
    the C++11 standard library, and will replace GNU libstdc++ in a
    future release. In 9.1-RELEASE, libstdc++ is still installed as
    standard and now dynamically links against libsupc++. This allows
    libraries linking libstdc++ and libc++ to both be used in the same
    program, to aid migration. r235798

-   The rtld(1) run-time linker now supports GCC’s RELRO (RElocation
    Read-Only). This prevents the GOT (Global Offset Table) from being
    overwritten. r231579

-   The rtld(1) run-time linker now supports a GNU hash section
    (DT_GNU_HASH), which is a replacement of optional ELF hash section.
    r235396

-   The setbuf(1) utility and libstdbuf library have been added. This
    controls the default buffering behavior of standard stdio streams.
    r235139

-   The xlocale(3) API has been implemented. This consists of
    _l-suffixed versions of various standard library functions that use
    the global locale, making them take an explicit locale parameter and
    allowing thread-safe extended locale support. Most of these APIs are
    required for IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (POSIX.1-2008 or ISO/IEC
    9945:2009) compatibility, and are required by libc++ and recent
    versions of GNOME. This implementation also supports several
    extensions for compatibility with Apple Darwin. r235785

-   ISC BIND has been updated to version 9.8.3-P4. r241417

-   The compiler-rt library, which provides low-level target-specific
    interfaces such as functions in libgcc, has been updated to
    revision 147467. r236018

-   file ( file(1)) has been updated to version 5.11. r237983

-   GNU gperf(1) has been updated to version 3.0.3 (the latest
    GPLv2-licensed version). r230237

-   libarchive, bsdtar(1), and cpio(1) have been updated to version
    2.8.5. r229588

-   libpcap library has been updated to 1.2.1. r236167

-   libstdc++ have been updated to rev 135556 of gcc-4_2-branch (the
    last LGPLv2-licensed version). r229551

-   The LLVM compiler infrastructure and clang, a C language family
    front-end, version 3.1 have been imported. Note that it is not used
    for building the FreeBSD base system by default. r236144

-   The netcat utility has been updated to version 5.1. r235971

-   OpenSSL has been updated to version 0.9.8x. r237998

-   tcpdump (tcpdump(1)) utility has been updated to version 4.2.1.
    r236192

-   The TENEX C shell (tcsh(1)) has been updated to version 6.18.01.
    r232633

-   The timezone database has been updated to the tzdata2012a release.
    r233447

-   zlib library has been updated to version 1.2.7. r237691
