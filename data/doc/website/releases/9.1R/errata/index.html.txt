FreeBSD 9.1-RELEASE Errata

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This document lists errata items for FreeBSD 9.1-RELEASE, containing
significant information discovered after the release or too late in the
release cycle to be otherwise included in the release documentation.
This information includes security advisories, as well as news relating
to the software or documentation that could affect its operation or
usability. An up-to-date version of this document should always be
consulted before installing this version of FreeBSD.

This errata document for FreeBSD 9.1-RELEASE will be maintained until
the release of FreeBSD 9.2-RELEASE.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction

This errata document contains “late-breaking news” about FreeBSD
9.1-RELEASE. Before installing this version, it is important to consult
this document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems
that may already have been found and fixed.

Any version of this errata document actually distributed with the
release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be out of date by
definition, but other copies are kept updated on the Internet and should
be consulted as the “current errata” for this release. These other
copies of the errata are located at http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/,
plus any sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.

Source and binary snapshots of FreeBSD 9.1-STABLE also contain
up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of the snapshot).

For a list of all FreeBSD CERT security advisories, see
http://www.FreeBSD.org/security/ or
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/.

Late-Breaking News

[November 2, 2012] The current mfi(4) driver has an overflow bug when
handling disks larger than 2^32 sectors in SYSPD volumes, also known as
JBODs, which will cause data corruption. This bug has been fixed on this
FreeBSD-CURRENT but was too late for inclusion in this release. An
Errata Notice for 9.1-RELEASE is planned.

[December 25, 2012] The Installtion Instructions had the following wrong
information about upgrading procedure. All of them have been fixed in
the online version.

-   The link URL of “upgrading section in the Release Notes”, branch
    names where upcoming Security Advisories or Errata Notices will be
    applied, and a command line argument of freebsd-update(8) were ones
    for 9.0-RELEASE, not for 9.1-RELEASE.

-   The list of releases supported by freebsd-update(8) utility were
    incorrect. For 9.X, The following versions are supported:
    9.0-RELEASE, 9.1-BETA1, and 9.1-RC[123].
