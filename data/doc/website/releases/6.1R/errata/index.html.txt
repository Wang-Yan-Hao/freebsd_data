  This document lists errata items for FreeBSD 6.1-RELEASE, containing
  significant information discovered after the release or too late in
  the release cycle to be otherwise included in the release
  documentation. This information includes security advisories, as well
  as news relating to the software or documentation that could affect
  its operation or usability. An up-to-date version of this document
  should always be consulted before installing this version of FreeBSD.

1 Introduction

This errata document contains “late-breaking news” about FreeBSD
6.1-RELEASE. Before installing this version, it is important to consult
this document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems
that may already have been found and fixed.

Any version of this errata document actually distributed with the
release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be out of date by
definition, but other copies are kept updated on the Internet and should
be consulted as the “current errata” for this release. These other
copies of the errata are located at http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/,
plus any sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.

Source and binary snapshots of FreeBSD 6-STABLE also contain up-to-date
copies of this document (as of the time of the snapshot).

For a list of all FreeBSD CERT security advisories, see
http://www.FreeBSD.org/security/ or

4 Known Problems and Solutions

(2006/05/10) The errata file distributed with FreeBSD 6.1-RELEASE
mistakenly contained the errata applicable to FreeBSD 6.0-RELEASE.

(2006/05/10) The release notes for FreeBSD 6.1-RELEASE gave the wrong
name for the KDE port in the item documenting the KDE upgrade. The
correct name is x11/kde3.

(2006/05/10) The release notes for FreeBSD 6.1-RELEASE should have
mentioned changes that enable the second core of dual-core i386 and
amd64 CPUs by default when running an SMP kernel.

(2006/05/13) A change in the ata(4) driver in FreeBSD 6.1-RELEASE
modified a software interface visible from userland programs. Programs
that use the IOCATAREQUEST ioctl(2) interface will need to be
recompiled. Typically, these programs communicate directly with ATA and
ATAPI drives, such as CDROM burning or ripping tools, or monitoring
utilities. One known example is smartd from the sysutils/smartmontools
port.

(2006/05/27, updated 2006/06/01) On FreeBSD/alpha, sysinstall(8)
sometimes does not allow a disk to be labeled. The disk is presented in
sysinstall(8) but actions like Auto do not result in a disklabel being
presented. One workaround is to boot the install CD, then select Fixit.
From the Fixit# prompt, run disklabel(8) manually. For example:
disklabel -rw da1 auto ensures a valid disklabel is written onto da1.
Reboot from the install media. sysinstall(8) will now detect a valid
disklabel on the disk and allow it to be partitioned to your preference.

(2006/05/27) FreeBSD 6.1-RELEASE includes a change to some definitions
in src/sys/net/if_media.h (revision 1.30.2.1). This could break
source-level compatibility with externally-maintained 10Gb Ethernet
network drivers written for FreeBSD 6.0-RELEASE. This change should have
been documented in the release notes.

(2006/06/01, updated 2006/07/07) A bug in the rc.d/jail startup script
could cause various problems for users attempting to configure jail(2)
environments at system startup time. A fix has been committed to HEAD,
RELENG_6, and RELENG_6_1. More details can be found in errata notice
FreeBSD-EN-06:01.jail.

(2006/06/01, updated 2006/08/30) Deadlocks have been observed (and can
be reproduced) in some cases where snapshots and quotas are both being
used on a file system. This problem has been fixed on the HEAD and
RELENG_6 branches.

(2006/06/01, updated 2006/08/28) A bug in the Neighbor Discovery
Protocol (NDP) implementation causes spurious error messages for
point-to-point IPv6 links on FreeBSD 6.1-RELEASE. This behavior is a
regression from FreeBSD 6.0-RELEASE. A solution for this problem has
been committed to HEAD, RELENG_6, and RELENG_6_1. Further details can be
found in errata notice FreeBSD-EN-06:02.net.

(2006/06/01, updated 2006/11/22) Problems have been observed when trying
to load packages from multiple CDROMs inside the sysinstall(8)
environment. Specifically, the disk-switching functionality in
sysinstall(8) seems to become confused about the contents of a disk that
has just been requested. This situation has been seen primarily when
installing the base system without Xorg (which lives on the first CDROM
of a multi-disk set), and then later using sysinstall(8) to load some
packages (such as the GNOME or KDE desktop environments) from a
subsequent CDROM that depend on Xorg. As a workaround during a new
install, one should try to install Xorg along with the base system, or
at least before any other packages that depend on it. This problem has
been corrected on HEAD and RELENG_6.

(2006/06/01, updated 2006/08/28) An error in the statistics-keeping
logic in the UMA kernel memory allocator has led to the number of
requests for mbufs denied (as reported by netstat -m) to increase
erroneously. A fix for this problem has been committed to HEAD,
RELENG_6, and RELENG_6_1. More information is contained in errata notice
FreeBSD-EN-06:02.net.

(2006/06/01, update 2006/10/07) A longstanding bug in the i386
bootloader can cause root file system corruption when the nextboot(8)
utility is used and the /boot/nextboot.conf configuration file happens
to be located after cylinder 1023 on the boot disk. A bugfix has been
committed to HEAD and has been merged to RELENG_6.

(2006/06/16, updated 2006/10/07) A locking-related bug has been observed
to cause noticeable slowdowns in NFS server performance. A fix has been
committed to HEAD and RELENG_6.

(2006/08/28) A local kernel panic in the network stack could be caused
by not checking the validity of a pointer before use. This problem has
been fixed on HEAD, RELENG_6, and RELENG_6_1, as described in
FreeBSD-EN-06:02.net.
