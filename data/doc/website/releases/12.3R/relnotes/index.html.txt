FreeBSD 12.3-RELEASE Release Notes

Abstract

The release notes for FreeBSD 12.3-RELEASE contain a summary of the
changes made to the FreeBSD base system on the 12-STABLE development
line. This document lists applicable security advisories that were
issued since the last release, as well as significant changes to the
FreeBSD kernel and userland. Some brief remarks on upgrading are also
presented.

Introduction

This document contains the release notes for FreeBSD 12.3-RELEASE. It
describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of FreeBSD. It
also provides some notes on upgrading from previous versions of FreeBSD.

The release distribution to which these release notes apply represents
the latest point along the 12-STABLE development branch since 12-STABLE
was created. Information regarding pre-built, binary release
distributions along this branch can be found at
https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/.

The release distribution to which these release notes apply represents a
point along the 12-STABLE development branch between 12.2-RELEASE and
the future 12.4-RELEASE. Information regarding pre-built, binary release
distributions along this branch can be found at
https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/.

This distribution of FreeBSD 12.3-RELEASE is a release distribution. It
can be found at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/ or any of its mirrors.
More information on obtaining this (or other) release distributions of
FreeBSD can be found in the Obtaining FreeBSD appendix to the FreeBSD
Handbook.

All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before installing
FreeBSD. The errata document is updated with "late-breaking" information
discovered late in the release cycle or after the release. Typically, it
contains information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections
to documentation. An up-to-date copy of the errata for FreeBSD
12.3-RELEASE can be found on the FreeBSD Web site.

This document describes the most user-visible new or changed features in
FreeBSD since 12.2-RELEASE. In general, changes described here are
unique to the 12-STABLE branch unless specifically marked as MERGED
features.

Typical release note items document recent security advisories issued
after 12.2-RELEASE, new drivers or hardware support, new commands or
options, major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades. They may
also list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering
practices. Clearly the release notes cannot list every single change
made to FreeBSD between releases; this document focuses primarily on
security advisories, user-visible changes, and major architectural
improvements.

Upgrading from Previous Releases of FreeBSD

Binary upgrades between RELEASE versions (and snapshots of the various
security branches) are supported using the freebsd-update(8) utility.
The binary upgrade procedure will update unmodified userland utilities,
as well as unmodified GENERIC kernels distributed as a part of an
official FreeBSD release. The freebsd-update(8) utility requires that
the host being upgraded have Internet connectivity.

Source-based upgrades (those based on recompiling the FreeBSD base
system from source code) from previous versions are supported, according
to the instructions in /usr/src/UPDATING.

Userland

This section covers changes and additions to userland applications,
contributed software, and system utilities.

Userland Configuration Changes

An update to the caroot CA bundle processor to support certificates
marked with a DISTRUST_AFTER entry.

The /etc/rc.final rc(8) script will now be run after all user processes
have terminated.

Userland Application Changes

The automount(8) utility will now explicitly set the root path to /
before performing an automatic mount.

The bectl(8) utility will now throw an error to prevent the creation of
a boot environment with spaces.

The bhyve(8) utility had support for large IOs fixed in nvme(4)
emulation.

The cmp(1) utility received -b, --print-bytes flags to be compatible
with GNU cmp(1).

The cmp(1) utility received the -i, --ignore-initial flags as an
alternative to skip1/skip2.

The cmp(1) utility now accepts SI suffixes for skip1/skip2.

The cmp(1) utility received the -n, --bytes flags to limit number of
bytes to compare.

The cpuset(1) utility can now be used by a jail to modify the roots of a
child jail.

General Notes Regarding Future FreeBSD Releases

FreeBSD EC2 AMI Ids

Support for recording EC2 AMI Ids in SSM was added to
release/Makefile.ec2 to allow SSM Parameter names to look like
/aws/service/freebsd/amd64/base/ufs/12.3/RELEASE using the public prefix
/aws/service/freebsd.

Default CPUTYPE Change

Starting with FreeBSD-13.0, the default CPUTYPE for the i386
architecture will change from 486 to 686.

This means that, by default, binaries produced will require a 686-class
CPU, including but not limited to binaries provided by the FreeBSD
Release Engineering team. FreeBSD 13.0 will continue to support older
CPUs, however users needing this functionality will need to build their
own releases for official support.

As the primary use for i486 and i586 CPUs is generally in the embedded
market, the general end-user impact is expected to be minimal, as new
hardware with these CPU types has long faded, and much of the deployed
base of such systems is nearing retirement age, statistically.

There were several factors taken into account for this change. For
example, i486 does not have 64-bit atomics, and while they can be
emulated in the kernel, they cannot be emulated in the userland.
Additionally, the 32-bit amd64 libraries have been i686 since their
inception.

As the majority of 32-bit testing is done by developers using the lib32
libraries on 64-bit hardware with the COMPAT_FREEBSD32 option in the
kernel, this change ensures better coverage and user experience. This
also aligns with what the majority of LinuxÂ® distributions have been
doing for quite some time.

This is expected to be the final bump of the default CPUTYPE in i386.
