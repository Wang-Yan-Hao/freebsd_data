FreeBSD 10.1-RELEASE Errata

Abstract

This document lists errata items for FreeBSD 10.1-RELEASE, containing
significant information discovered after the release or too late in the
release cycle to be otherwise included in the release documentation.
This information includes security advisories, as well as news relating
to the software or documentation that could affect its operation or
usability. An up-to-date version of this document should always be
consulted before installing this version of FreeBSD.

This errata document for FreeBSD 10.1-RELEASE will be maintained until
the release of FreeBSD 10.2-RELEASE.

Introduction

This errata document contains "late-breaking news" about FreeBSD
10.1-RELEASE Before installing this version, it is important to consult
this document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems
that may already have been found and fixed.

Any version of this errata document actually distributed with the
release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be out of date by
definition, but other copies are kept updated on the Internet and should
be consulted as the "current errata" for this release. These other
copies of the errata are located at http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/,
plus any sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.

Source and binary snapshots of FreeBSD 10.1-STABLE also contain
up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of the snapshot).

For a list of all FreeBSD CERT security advisories, see
http://www.FreeBSD.org/security/ or
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/.

Open Issues

-   FreeBSD/i386 10.1-RELEASE running as a guest operating system on
    VirtualBox can have a problem with disk I/O access. It depends on
    some specific hardware configuration and does not depend on a
    specific version of VirtualBox or host operating system.

    It causes various errors and makes FreeBSD quite unstable. Although
    the cause is still unclear, disabling unmapped I/O works as a
    workaround. To disable it, choose Escape to loader prompt in the
    boot menu and enter the following lines from loader(8) prompt, after
    an OK:

        set vfs.unmapped_buf_allowed=0
        boot

    Note that the following line has to be added to /boot/loader.conf
    after a boot. It disables unmapped I/O at every boot:

        vfs.unmapped_buf_allowed=0

    [2014-04-03 update] It has been reported that instability may be
    present on virtual machines running on other hypervisors, such as
    Xen or KVM.

-   FreeBSD/i386 10.1-RELEASE configured with a multi-disk ZFS dataset
    (mirror, raidz1, raidz2, raidz3) may crash during boot when the ZFS
    pool mount is attempted while booting an unmodified GENERIC kernel.

    As described in /usr/src/UPDATING entry 20121223, rebuilding the
    kernel with options KSTACK_PAGES=4 has been observed to resolve the
    boot-time crash. This, however, is not an ideal solution for
    inclusion in the GENERIC kernel configuration, as increasing
    KSTACK_PAGES implicitly decreases available usermode threads in an
    environment that is already resource-starved.

    Taking into account the heavy resource requirements of ZFS, in
    addition to the i386-specific tuning requirements for general
    workloads, using ZFS with the FreeBSD/i386 GENERIC kernel is
    strongly discouraged.

    Warning: It is extremely important to take note that, by default,
    freebsd-update(8) will install the GENERIC kernel configuration, and
    as such, freebsd-update(8) consumers are strongly encouraged to
    avoid FreeBSD-provided kernel binary upgrades with such
    configurations.

    Note: Although there is slight change in how the crash manifests on
    FreeBSD/i386 between 10.0-RELEASE and 10.1-RELEASE, and given the
    date of the /usr/src/UPDATING entry, there is no evidence suggesting
    this is a regression between FreeBSD 10.0-RELEASE and FreeBSD
    10.1-RELEASE directly.

-   Due to an incompatibility between bsdconfig(8) and pkg(8) version
    1.3, packages included on the FreeBSD dvd installer will not be
    recognized by bsdconfig(8).

    To install packages from the dvd1.iso installer, create the /dist
    target directory, and manually mount the dvd1.iso ISO:

        # mkdir -p /dist
        # mount -t cd9660 /dev/cd0 /dist

    Note: Be sure to use the correct /dev device path for the dvd1.iso
    ISO installer.

    Next, set REPOS_DIR to the path of the repos/ directory within the
    installer so pkg(8) will use the correct repository metadata.

    If using sh(1):

        # export REPOS_DIR=/dist/packages/repos

    If using csh(1):

        # setenv REPOS_DIR /dist/packages/repos

    Note: Keep in mind that REPOS_DIR will need to be set again after
    the current shell session is terminated, if continuing to use the
    packages provided on the dvd1.iso installer.

    Finally, bootstrap pkg(8) from the ISO, and install required
    packages:

        # pkg bootstrap
        # pkg install xorg-server xorg gnome2 [...]

-   [2015-02-06] Affects binary upgrade users: The second phase of
    freebsd-update install, the phase where the running userland is
    upgraded, fails on systems deployed with nss_ldap enabled in
    nsswitch.conf(5) when upgrading from 10.0-RELEASE to 10.1-RELEASE.

A workaround is to disable nss_ldap in nsswitch.conf(5) prior to running
freebsd-update install to upgrade the userland, after which it can be
enabled again when the upgrade process is completed.

The problem is being investigated, and an Errata Notice is expected to
be issued when a solution to the problem is identified.

-   [2015-03-31] Several reports were received regarding the QCOW2
    FreeBSD virtual machine images crashing on boot. As result of this,
    these images have been removed from the FTP mirrors, and the hashes
    removed from CHECKSUM.SHA256 and CHECKSUM.MD5 in the VM-IMAGES/
    directory on the FTP mirrors.
