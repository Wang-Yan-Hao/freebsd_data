  Issue                        Status          Responsible   Description
  twe(4) stability problem     Needs testing   --            The twe(4) driver has a stability problem when a lot of rapid sequential small file inserts into a new directory tree. A set of patches for the problem has been committed just before 4.10-RC3.
  vmspace leak                 Needs testing   --            Copying vm_exitingcnt to the new vmspace in vmspace_exec() can make it very high values and never drop to 0 and be freed. This can cause a system crash. A patch for the problem has been committed just before 4.10-RC3.
  twa(4) fails in sysinstall   Needs testing   --            When a twa(4) device in a system with no SCSI controller is detected, sysinstall in 4.10-RC2 does not recognize the disks attached. It seems that this problem may involve inconsistency between the CAM device rescanning and the kernel module loading. A patch for the problem has been committed just before 4.10-RC3.
