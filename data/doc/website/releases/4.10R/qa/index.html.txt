Testing Guide for 4.10-RELEASE

Goals

As part of our on-going effort to improve the release engineering
process, we have identified several areas that need significant quality
assurance testing during the release candidate phase. Below, we've
listed the changes in 4.10-RELEASE that we feel merit the most attention
due to their involving substantial changes to the system, or having
arrived late in the development cycle leading up to the release. In
general, our goal in the QA process is to attempt to check a number of
things:

-   The system has not regressed with respects to stability,
    correctness, interoperability, or performance of features present in
    prior releases.
-   New features result in the desired improvement in stability,
    correctness, interoperability, or performance.

To effectively determine this, it's desirable to test the system in a
diverse set of environments, applying a wide set of workloads, forcing
the system to operate both within and outside its normal specification.
Particular focus should often be placed on the continuing (or new)
capability of the system to perform correctly when used in concert with
systems from other vendors.

Features to explore carefully:

-   There was a large merge of the USB code from RELENG_5 into RELENG_4.
    This requires as much testing as possible to make sure that no
    devices have regressed in stability or functionality.

The release notes will always be a good place to look for things to
test.
