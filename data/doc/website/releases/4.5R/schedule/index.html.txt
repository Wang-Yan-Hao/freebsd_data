  Reminder announcement                 01 Dec 2001   03 Dec 2001   Release Engineers send announcement email to developers@FreeBSD.org with a rough schedule for the FreeBSD 4.5 release.
  4.5-PRERELEASE                        20 Dec 2001   20 Dec 2001   newvers.sh, param.h, and release.ent updated.

  Code freeze begins                    20 Dec 2001   20 Dec 2001   After this date, all commits to the RELENG_4 branch must be approved by re@FreeBSD.org. Certain highly active documentation committers are exempt from this rule for routine man page / release note updates. Heads-up emails should be sent to the developers@, stable@, and qa@ lists.
  Commercial software demos updated.    05 Jan 2002   24 Jan 2002   The second disc contains commercial software demos, these demos should be updated to contain the latest versions.
  4.5-RC                                09 Jan 2002   09 Jan 2002   newvers.sh and release.ent updated.
  Announce the Ports Freeze             09 Jan 2002   09 Jan 2002   Someone from portmgr should email freebsd-ports@ and CC: developers@ to set a date for the tagging of the ports tree. Will set this date at January 22nd.
  Heads up to hubs                      09 Jan 2002   09 Jan 2002   A message should be sent to freebsd-hubs@FreeBSD.org before the release is uploaded. The site administrators have frequently requested advance notice for new ISOs.
  First release candidate               09 Jan 2002   09 Jan 2002   The first release candidate for the x86 and Alpha architecture is released. ISO images should be uploaded to ftp-master.FreeBSD.org and releng4.FreeBSD.org. A network install directory should be uploaded to ftp-master.FreeBSD.org. The packages and XF86336 directories may be symlinked to save space, as long as you're sure to use relative symlinks.

  Ports tree frozen.                    22 Jan 2002   22 Jan 2002   CVSROOT/avail locks out everyone but the person who does the tagging. It will take approximately 2 hours to tag the entire ports tree with the RELEASE_4_5_0 tag. After this time, the ports/ tree will be re-opened for commits, but commits made after tagging will not go in 4.5-RELEASE.
  Final package build starts            22 Jan 2002   22 Jan 2002   The ports cluster and bento build final packages.

It's been pointed out that this table is rather boring. Bruce Mah gave a
slightly more interesting rendition of the 12 days of Code-Freeze.
