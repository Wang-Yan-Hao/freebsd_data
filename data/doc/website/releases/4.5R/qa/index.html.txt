Testing Guide for 4.5-RELEASE

Goals

As part of our on-going effort to improve the release engineering
process, we have identified several areas that need significant quality
assurance testing during the release candidate phase. Below, we've
listed the changes in 4.5-PRERELEASE that we feel merit the most
attention due to their involving substantial changes to the system, or
having arrived late in the development cycle leading up to the release.
In general, our goal in the QA process is to attempt to check a number
of things:

-   The system has not regressed with respects to stability,
    correctness, interoperability, or performance of features present in
    prior releases.
-   New features result in the desired improvement in stability,
    correctness, interoperability, or performance.

To effectively determine this, it's desirable to test the system in a
diverse set of environments, applying a wide set of workloads, forcing
the system to operate both within and outside its normal specification.
Particular focus should often be placed on the continuing (or new)
capability of the system to perform correctly when used in concert with
systems from other vendors.

Features to explore carefully:

-   Recent TCP changes, especially relating to the delayed ACK fix,
    congestion response, syncache, syncookies, increased socket buffer
    sizes, et al. We're interested in testing interoperability with as
    many platforms as possible, demonstrating continued strong (and
    better) scalability and performance, and watching out for quirks
    (connection stalls, ...), not to mention crashes. Jonathan Lemon was
    responding to a panic report on freebsd-current earlier today
    regarding a PCB call, which is something we should keep an eye on.
    On the other hand, Yahoo! is now deploying this code, and that
    should help test it a great deal.
-   VFS/VM/NFS fixes. We need to continue to test performance,
    correctness, and interoperability. In particular, I'd like to see a
    lot of inter-platform performance testing (FreeBSD->Solaris, vice
    versa, etc). We'd also like careful investigation of low-memory
    situations.
-   FFS fixes. We had some reports of deadlocks in FFS; it sounds like
    Matt Dillon has caught most of them, but combinations I'd particular
    like to see tested involve Quotas, Chroot, and NFS, under load, and
    involving memory mapping and heavy directory operations.
-   NTP 4.1. This is probably reasonable safe, but it doesn't hurt to do
    interop testing, especially on the Alpha platform.
-   SMBfs. We need stability testing, mostly, I suspect. Performance is
    probably not a large focus. While SMBfs support has been available
    on -STABLE through a port previously, determining that the
    integration with the base system (especially the boot process) was
    done correctly is important. Attempting to use SMBfs in /etc/fstab
    in a diskless environment might be one thing to explore, for
    example.
-   Once the man page change goes in (which I think it should) we'll
    want some basic testing of the man command. Update: This change
    proved too controversial for introduction this late in the release
    cycle, and so it will not be included with FreeBSD 4.5.
-   cdboot. Late in the release cycle, a new implementation of the
    CD-based boot loader was introduced. This should generally improve
    support for booting or installing from CD, but this change requires
    testing on a variety of architectures and devices. Update: Thanks to
    everyone who helped test this functionality. A number of users
    reported problems booting with this new loader, so this will not be
    used for FreeBSD 4.5.
-   Sysinstall module loading. In order to make room for more devices on
    the boot floppy, a number of wireless Ethernet device drivers were
    moved over to the MFSROOT floppy in the form of loadable kernel
    modules. We would like to see this functionality tested thoroughly
    before the final release.
-   ATA code. The ATA driver has been updated to support 48bit
    addressing and has been tested to work with at least one 160GB IDE
    drive. Further testing with very large IDE drives is necessary.
-   XFree86. There was at least one problem report with XFree86 4.x sent
    to the qa@FreeBSD.org mailing list. Please help us test this
    important third party software package to ensure it works well with
    FreeBSD 4.5. The FreeBSD Handbook may need to be updated to describe
    the recommended procedure for installing XFree86 4.x during a new
    installation.
-   Linux Compatibility. There was a small change in the Ethernet device
    enumeration of the Linux compatibility layer. All Linux applications
    should be tested under the new environment. In particular, those
    applications that deal with network interfaces should be tested
    carefully.

The release notes will always be a good place to look for things to
test. There are a number of new drivers, including if_em, which would
probably benefit from more exposure. Please report bugs to the
qa@FreeBSD.org list, and/or via send-pr with a heads up to the qa list.

Known Issues

4.5 Release Candidate 3 was released on January 23. There will be one
final release candidate before the final release. Please see the
postings to qa@FreeBSD.org and stable@FreeBSD.org for more information.
