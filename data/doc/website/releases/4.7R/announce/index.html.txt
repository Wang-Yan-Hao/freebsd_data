FreeBSD 4.7-RELEASE Announcement

Date: Thu, 10 Oct 2002 07:47:54 -0700
From: "Murray Stokely" <murray@FreeBSD.org>
To: freebsd-announce@FreeBSD.org
Subject: FreeBSD 4.7-RELEASE is now available

I am happy to announce the availability of FreeBSD 4.7-RELEASE, the
latest release of the FreeBSD -STABLE development branch. Since FreeBSD
4.6-RELEASE in June 2002, we have updated a number of software programs
in the base system, such as GCC and sendmail. Several new drivers have
been added for USB devices and disk controllers. We have also
incorporated updates for XFree86 and our Linux emulation libraries.

FreeBSD 4.7 also incorporates all of the security and bug fixes from
4.6.2 (released in August 2002), including several ATA-related bugfixes,
updates for OpenSSL and OpenSSH, and fixes to address several security
advisories.

For a complete list of new features and known problems, please see the
release notes and errata list, available here:

http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/4.7R/relnotes.html

http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/4.7R/errata.html

For more information about FreeBSD release engineering activities
(including information about the upcoming FreeBSD 5.0), please see:

http://www.FreeBSD.org/releng/

Availability

FreeBSD 4.7-RELEASE supports the i386 and alpha architectures and can be
installed directly over the net using the boot floppies or copied to a
local NFS/FTP server. Distributions for the i386 are available now. As
of this writing, the final builds for the alpha architecture are in
progress and will be made available shortly.

We can't promise that all the mirror sites will carry the larger ISO
images, but they will at least be available from:

-   ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/
-   ftp://ftp12.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/
-   ftp://ftp.tw.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/
-   ftp://ftp{2,3,4,5}.jp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/
-   ftp://ftp.cz.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/
-   ftp://ftp7.de.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/
-   ftp://ftp.lt.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/
-   ftp://ftp2.za.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/
-   ftp://ftp.se.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/
-   ftp://ftp{1,2,4}.ru.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/

If you can't afford FreeBSD on media, are impatient, or just want to use
it for evangelism purposes, then by all means download the ISO images,
otherwise please continue to support the FreeBSD Project by purchasing
media from one of our supporting vendors. The following companies have
contributed substantially to the development of FreeBSD:

  -------------------- --------------------------------------
  FreeBSD Mall, Inc.   http://www.freebsdmall.com/
  Daemon News          http://www.bsdmall.com/freebsd1.html
  -------------------- --------------------------------------

Each CD or DVD set contains the FreeBSD installation and application
package bits for the i386 ("PC") architecture. For a set of distfiles
used to build ports in the ports collection, please see the FreeBSD
Toolkit, a 6 CD set containing extra bits which no longer fit on the 4
CD set, or the DVD distribution.

FreeBSD is also available via anonymous FTP from mirror sites in the
following countries: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada,
China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hong
Kong, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Lithuania, the
Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Saudi
Arabia, South Africa, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan,
Thailand, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom.

Before trying the central FTP site, please check your regional mirror(s)
first by going to:

ftp://ftp.<yourdomain>.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD

Any additional mirror sites will be labeled ftp2, ftp3 and so on.

More information about FreeBSD mirror sites can be found at:

http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/mirrors-ftp.html

For instructions on installing FreeBSD, please see Chapter 2 of The
FreeBSD Handbook. It provides a complete installation walk-through for
users new to FreeBSD, and can be found online at:

http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/install.html

Acknowledgments

Many companies donated equipment, network access, or man-hours to
finance the release engineering activities for FreeBSD 4.7 including The
FreeBSD Mall, Compaq, Yahoo!, Sentex Communications, and NTT/Verio.

In addition to myself, the release engineering team for 4.7-RELEASE
includes:

  Bruce Mah <bmah@FreeBSD.org>          Release Engineering, Documentation
  Robert Watson <rwatson@FreeBSD.org>   Release Engineering, Security
  John Baldwin <jhb@FreeBSD.org>        Release Engineering, alpha Builds
  Brian Somers <brian@FreeBSD.org>      Release Engineering
  Steve Price <steve@FreeBSD.org>       Package Splits
  Will Andrews <will@FreeBSD.org>       Package Splits
  Kris Kennaway <kris@FreeBSD.org>      Package Building
  ------------------------------------- ------------------------------------

Please join me in thanking them for all the hard work which went into
making this release. Many thanks are also due to the FreeBSD committers
(committers@FreeBSD.org), without whom there would be nothing to
release, and thousands of FreeBSD users world-wide who have contributed
bug fixes, features, and suggestions.

Enjoy!
