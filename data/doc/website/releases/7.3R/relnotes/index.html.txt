FreeBSD 7.3-RELEASE Release Notes

Release Highlights

The highlights in the 7.3-RELEASE are the following:

-   The ZFS file system has been updated to version 13. The changes
    include ZFS operations by a regular user, L2ARC, ZFS Intent Log on
    separated disks (slog), sparse volumes, and so on.

-   A lock handling error has been fixed in interaction between
    malloc(3) implementation and threading library.

-   A deadlock in the sched_ule(4) scheduler has been fixed.

-   A new sysctl variable security.bsd.map_at_zero has been added and
    set to 1 (allow) by default. This controls whether FreeBSD allows to
    map an object at the address 0, which is part of the user-controlled
    portion of the virtual address space. Disabling this has some effect
    on preventing an attack which injects malicious code into that
    location and triggers a NULL pointer dereference in the kernel.

-   A new boot loader gptzfsboot, which supports GPT and ZFS has been
    added. zfsloader, the final boot loader similar to loader(8) which
    supports ZFS has been added.

-   [amd64, i386] CPU cache flushing has been optimized when changing
    caching attributes of pages by doing nothing for CPUs that support
    self-snooping and using CLFLUSH instead of a full cache invalidate
    when possible.

-   The amdsbwd(4) driver for AMD SB600/SB7xx watchdog timer has been
    added.

-   [amd64, i386] The hwpmc(4) driver for Hardware Performance
    Monitoring Counter support has been added.

-   DRM now supports Radeon HD 4200 (RS880), 4770 (RV740), and R6/7xx
    3D, and Intel G41 chips.

-   The alc(4) driver for Atheros AR8131/AR8132 PCIe Ethernet controller
    has been added.

-   [sparc64] The cas(4) driver has been added to provide support for
    Sun Cassini/Cassini+ and National Semiconductor DP83065 Saturn
    Gigabit Ethernet devices.

-   A userland utility mfiutil(8) for the mfi(4) devices has been added.

-   A userland utility mptutil(8) for the mpt(4) devices has been added.

-   The yp(8) utilities now support shadow.byname and shadow.byuid maps.
    These requires privileged port access.

-   The service(8) command as an easy interface for the rc.d scripts has
    been added.

-   ISC BIND has been updated to version 9.4-ESV.

-   sendmail has been updated from version 8.14.3 to version 8.14.4.

-   The supported version of the GNOME desktop environment (x11/gnome2)
    has been updated to 2.28.2.

-   The supported version of the KDE desktop environment (x11/kde4) has
    been updated to 4.3.5.

-   FreeBSD release ISO images now have “FreeBSD-” at the beginning of
    the filenames.

For more details, please see the Detailed Release Notes.

A list of all platforms currently under development can be found on the
Supported Platforms page.
