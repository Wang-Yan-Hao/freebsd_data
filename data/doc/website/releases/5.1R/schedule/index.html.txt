FreeBSD 5.1 Release Process

Introduction

This is a specific schedule for the release of FreeBSD 5.1. For more
general information about the release engineering process, please see
the Release Engineering section of the web site.

General discussions about the release engineering process or quality
assurance issues should be sent to the public FreeBSD-qa mailing list.
MFC requests should be sent to re@FreeBSD.org.

One of the major features of FreeBSD 5.1 will be further refinement of
the re-worked SMP support introduced in FreeBSD 5.0.

FreeBSD 5.1 will continue to be released from the 5-CURRENT development
stream. For more details about the milestones for reaching 5-STABLE, see
the 5-STABLE Roadmap page.

The current release engineering TODO list is also available. This list
is updated periodically through the release cycle.
