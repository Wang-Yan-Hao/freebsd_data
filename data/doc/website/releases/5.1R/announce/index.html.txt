FreeBSD 5.1-RELEASE Announcement

Date: Mon, 9 Jun 2003 09:36:57 -0700 (PDT)
From: Scott Long <scottl@FreeBSD.org>
To: freebsd-announce@FreeBSD.org
Subject: [FreeBSD-Announce] ]FreeBSD 5.1 Released!

It is my great privilege and pleasure to announce the availability of
FreeBSD 5.1-RELEASE. This release continues FreeBSD on the path of
advanced multiprocessor and application thread support and includes many
improved and widely-sought features:

-   Experimental 1:1 and M:N thread libraries provide kernel support for
    efficient application multithreading.
-   Support for Physical Address Extensions enables Pentium Pro and
    higher CPUs to access up to 64GB of RAM.
-   Experimental Name Service Switch infrastructure allows enterprises
    to seamlessly integrate with LDAP and Active Directory services.
-   Enhanced "jail" management, allowing one server to provide many
    different "virtual machines" with reduced administrator workload.
-   New device drivers include support for IBM/Adaptec ServeRAID
    controllers, expanded support for USB 2.0 and USB Ethernet adapters,
    and Promise Serial ATA controllers.
-   Experimental support for the amd64 platform allows FreeBSD to run on
    single processor AMD Opteron systems.

Although stability is greatly improved and many bugs have been fixed,
FreeBSD 5.1 might not be suitable for all users. More conservative users
may prefer to continue using FreeBSD 4.X. Information on the various
trade-offs involved, as well as some notes on future plans for both
FreeBSD 4.X and 5.X, can be found in the Early Adopter's Guide,
available here:

http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/5.1R/early-adopter.html

For a complete list of new features and known problems, please see the
release notes and errata list, available here:

http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/5.1R/relnotes.html

http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/5.1R/errata.html

For more information about FreeBSD release engineering activities,
please see:

This release is dedicated to the memory of Alan Eldridge. Alan was a
talented and dedicated member of the KDE On FreeBSD team and the FreeBSD
community, and his passing is mourned by all of us. For more
information, please see http://freebsd.kde.org/memoriam/alane.php.

Availability

FreeBSD 5.1-RELEASE supports the i386, pc98, alpha, sparc64, and ia64
architectures and can be installed directly over the net using the boot
floppies or copied to a local NFS/FTP server. Distributions for all
architectures are available now.

Please continue to support the FreeBSD Project by purchasing media from
one of our supporting vendors. The following companies will be offering
FreeBSD 5.1 based products:

  Daemonnews, Inc.     http://www.bsdmall.com/freebsd1.html

If you can't afford FreeBSD on media, are impatient, or just want to use
it for evangelism purposes, then by all means download the ISO images.
We can't promise that all the mirror sites will carry the larger ISO
images, but they will at least be available from:
