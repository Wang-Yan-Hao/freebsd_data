  Issue                             Status                        Responsible       Description
  devfs umount panic                Not done                                        There is a race condition between device removal and devfs umounts that causes "Memory modified after free" panics. Can be reproduced by doing 'mdconfig -u' concurrently with unmounting a devfs instance.
  /dev/kmem panic                   Not done                                        Kris has noticed panics on SMP machines when there was ABI breakage of libkvm and world was not rebuilt and utilities like fstat were used. This suggests panics can be caused by incorrect accesses to /dev/kmem.
  KLDs on sparc64                   Not done                                        On sparc64 machines with more than 4Gb memory KLDs are not usable and will panic the system. The problem is reportedly with how the KLDs are compiled, it only works if the code ends up below 4G.
  Max RAM on sparc64                Not done                                        Maximum RAM on sparc64 appears to be limited to 16Gb.
  make -jN                          Not done                                        Doing 'make -jN', then suspending/resuming it may result in make reporting it lost child process(es).
  OpenBSM                           Deferred for future release   Robert Watson     The integration of OpenBSM is waiting on some final licensing hurdles. Once those are cleared, it will be a very desirable feature for 6.0.
  update sysinstall disk labeling   In progress                   Craig Rodrigues   Sysinstall could use the same fixes recently made to fdisk so it plays nice with GEOM and disk labeling. This does not cause problems during install because nothing on the disk is mounted when its label is being manipulated but it can cause problems if sysinstall gets used on a live system to adjust labels on existing disks which sys-admins tend to do.

  Issue          Status        Responsible                                           Description
  dhclient       Not done      freebsd-doc                                           The ISC DHCP client v3.x has been removed in favor of the OpenBSD DHCP client which was based on ISC DHCP v2.X. Minimal updates to the FreeBSD Handbook may be required.
  WPA / hostap   In progress   loader@freebsdmall.com, Sam Leffler, Murray Stokely   Significant new wireless functionality will be available with FreeBSD 6.0. The wireless section of the FreeBSD Handbook should be updated to describe how to connect to networks with WPA keys, setup host access points, etc. A howto in progress is available here.

Testing foci for 6.0-RELEASE

  --------------------------------------------------------- --------------- ----------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Issue                                                     Status          Responsible                   Description
  New dhclient                                              Needs testing   Brooks Davis                  The ISC DHCP client v3.x has been removed in favor of the OpenBSD DHCP client which was based on ISC DHCP v2.X. More testing is needed to make sure there are no major regressions in functionality. We are particularly interested in tests involving non-standard environments.
  WPA / hostap                                              Needs testing   Sam Leffler                   Significant new wireless functionality is available in FreeBSD 6.0. As this functionality is rather new, further testing would be appreciated.
  if_bridge                                                 Needs testing                                 A new bridge implementation has been added from NetBSD. As this has not seen a wider audience yet, further testing would be appreciated. See if_bridge(4) for configuration details.
  sysinstall dhclient problems                              Needs testing   Scott Long, Sam Leffler       sysinstall has been updated to deal with the new DHCP client in 6.0, more testing is needed.
  ULE                                                       Needs testing   David Xu                      The ULE scheduler has been fixed on both HEAD and RELENG_6. More testing is needed.
  aac(4) regression                                         Needs testing   Scott Long                    There had been a regression in the aac device driver on Dell 2550 machines. This should be fixed but more testing would be good.
  vnode_pager_init nswbuf initialization bug                Needs testing   Alexander Kabaev              There had been a serious performance regression due to a very low bound on the number of swap buffers per vnode (1). This should be fixed but more testing would be good.
  fdisk & boot0cfg                                          Needs testing   Poul-Henning Kamp             The boot0cfg and fdisk utilities need to be updated to use the proper GEOM model for updating the boot sector of a mounted disk.
  Alarming devfs shutdown error needs to be quenched        Done            Robert Watson                 During system shutdown, devfs generates a spurious error message due to /dev being non-unmountable: "unmount of /dev failed (BUSY)". While this is not a product of serious breakage, it is a potentially alarming error, whose source should either be fixed, or the message should be forceably quenched, in order to avoid many false positive bug reports and user concern.
  page fault at if_ethersubr.c: 284                         Done            Gleb Smirnoff                 Found by stress tests at http://www.holm.cc/stress/log/cons141.html.
  Livelock                                                  Needs testing   Tor Egge                      Found by stress tests at http://www.holm.cc/stress/log/cons139.html. This is the second most frequent panic reported by Peter Holm.
  panic: softdep_setup_inomapdep: found inode               Needs testing   Tor Egge                      Found by stress tests at http://www.holm.cc/stress/log/cons138.html.
  M_SAVEDINO                                                Needs testing   Tor Egge                      A 'memory modified after free' bug affecting M_SAVEDINO. Possibly a softupdates bug.
  kgdb                                                      Needs testing   Marcel Moolenaar              kgdb has been modified to handle trap frames on all tier 1 and 2 architectures. This allows tracebacks to provide useful info.
  panic: wrong b_bufobj                                     Needs testing   Tor Egge                      Found by stress tests at http://www.holm.cc/stress/log/cons140.html. This is high priority and can be provoked within minutes of testing!
  Panic when filesystem fills                               Done            Robert Watson                 Inadequate locking causes panics when calling kernel printf functions. This is most often seen when a filesystem fills up and uprintf() is called to report it to the console, but it can happen in many other places also. Properly locking the upper and lower parts of the tty subsystem likely cannot happen for 6.0, but temporary fixes must be developed and committed. A patch has now been committed that is believed to fix this problem by acquiring Giant in uprintf() and tprintf(), as well as a regression test. This work-around has now been merged to RELENG_6 and is ready for wide-spread testing.
  panic on multicast socket close after interface removal   Done            Robert Watson                 Due to the addition of multicast locking, a long-present memory corruption bug now generates an immediate panic if an interface is removed while a multicast group is in use on the interface. This can manifest if running routed and using vlans. A regression test has now been committed as msocket_ifnet_remove. A short-term fix will be to GC references to the interface in the IPv4/IPv6 multicast socket options hung off of the inpcb; a long term solution will require determining the correct application semantics for interface removal as relates to multicast sockets. This problem is described in detail in PR kern/77665. A fix has now been committed to 7-CURRENT in the CVS HEAD, and merged to RELENG_6.
  panic: handle_written_inodeblock: live inodedep           Needs testing   Don “Truck” Lewis, Tor Egge   Found by stress tests at http://www.holm.cc/stress/log/cons142.html.
  "snaplk" livelock                                         Needs testing   Don “Truck” Lewis             Found by stress tests at http://www.holm.cc/stress/log/cons143.html.
  fpudna: fpcurthread == curthread 1 times                  Needs testing   Stephan Uphoff                This warning is appearing sporadically on a dual AMD64 system. It appears to be warning against a legitimate problem, and thus should be investigated and fixed.
  race condition in POSIX named fifos                       Done            Robert Watson                 There have been multiple reports of panics when running with make -j on SMP systems, which appear to be associated with a race condition in the POSIX named fifo support. A number of regression tests have been written to confirm that any fix does not break fifos, and a number of other unrelated bugs were fixed in the process. The cause of the symptoms has been identified, and a workaround has been committed to 7-CURRENT for testing; it has been merged to RELENG_6 for testing.
  UFS_EXTATTR_AUTOSTART                                     Done            Robert Watson                 Changes in VFS locking as part of the SMPng work have resulted in a new panic during the auto-starting of UFS1 extended attributes. A patch to fix this has been committed (ufs_extattr.c:1.82), and now requires further testing before it is merged to RELENG_6 and RELENG_6_0.
