1 Introduction

This errata document contains “late-breaking news” about FreeBSD
6.0-RELEASE. Before installing this version, it is important to consult
this document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems
that may already have been found and fixed.

Any version of this errata document actually distributed with the
release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be out of date by
definition, but other copies are kept updated on the Internet and should
be consulted as the “current errata” for this release. These other
copies of the errata are located at http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/,
plus any sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.

Source and binary snapshots of FreeBSD 6-STABLE also contain up-to-date
copies of this document (as of the time of the snapshot).

4 Known Problems and Solutions

(2005/11/26) On 6.0-RELEASE, the following ipfw(4) rule is interpreted
in a different way from the previous releases:

    allow ipv6 from 192.168.0.2 to me

When ipfw(4) does not support IPv6 (see the next entry for the details),
ipfw(8) accepts this rule and this blocks an IPv6 packet encapsulated in
an IPv4 packet (IPv6-over-IPv4 tunneling, protocol number 41) whose
source address is 192.168.0.2. When it supports IPv6, on the other hand,
this means a rule to allow an IPv6 packet from 192.168.0.2, and actually
ipfw(8) rejects this rule because the syntax is incorrect (“an IPv6
packet from an IPv4 address” never happens). Unfortunately there is no
simple workaround for this problem.

The ipfw(4) IPv6 support still has rough edges and there are other
problems due to incompatibility between the two. As a workaround for
them, you can use a combination of IPv4-only ipfw(4) and ip6fw(8), which
is almost compatible with the prior releases, instead of ipfw(4) with
IPv6 support. To disable IPv6 support of ipfw(4), use the ipfw.ko kernel
module and do not use the kernel option IPFIREWALL.

(2005/11/19) Although the FreeBSD 6.0-RELEASE Release Notes states that
ipfw(4) subsystem now supports IPv6, the combination of the GENERIC
kernel and a kernel module ipfw.ko does not support the ip6 protocol
keyword for packet filtering rule. This is because the kernel option
INET6 in the kernel configuration file is not recognized when the
ipfw.ko is built. To enable IPv6 support of ipfw(4), rebuild the kernel
with kernel options INET6 and IPFIREWALL instead of using the ipfw.ko
module.

(2005/11/16) Using if_bridge(4) in combination with a packet filter such
as ipfw(4) and pf(4) can prevent the network stack from working and/or
lead to a system panic after a certain period of time. This is because
it allocates mbuf(9) buffers for network packets and never releases a
part of them, so eventually all of the buffer memory will be exhausted.
This problem has been fixed in the HEAD and the RELENG_6 branch after
10:17:15 2005/11/16 UTC.

(2005/11/16, updated on 2005/11/19) When an ipfw(4) divert rule is
specified with the protocol keyword ip or all, IPv6 packets are silently
discarded at that rule since the divert(4) socket does not support IPv6.
This can be a problem especially for an IPv4 and IPv6 dual-stack host
with natd(8) enabled. Note that the kernel module ipfw.ko does not have
this problem because it does not support IPv6. To avoid this problem,
use an IPv4 specific divert rule such as divert natd ipv4 instead of
divert natd all.

(2005/11/6) The FreeBSD 6.0-RELEASE Release Notes wrongly states a
kernel option related to ipfw(8) as IPFIRWALL_FORWARD. The correct
option keyword is IPFIREWALL_FORWARD.

(2005/11/5) The FreeBSD 6.0-RELEASE Release Notes wrongly states the
version number of OpenSSH and IPFilter integrated into FreeBSD as 4.1p1
and 4.1.18. The correct versions are 4.2p1 and 4.1.8 respectively.

(2005/11/5) Distribution of 6.0-RELEASE contains CHECKSUM.MD5 and
CHECKSUM.SHA256 files for protecting the integrity of data. However,
these files in 6.0-RELEASE erroneously include checksums for the
checksum files themselves. Although the checksums look like wrong, they
can be safely ignored because a checksum for the checksum file never
corresponds to one in the file. This problem will be fixed in the next
releases.

(2005/11/5, FreeBSD/amd64 specific) The pmcstat(8) utility cannot yet
handle 32-bit executables when converting hwpmc(4) log files to gprof(1)
format.

(2005/11/5, FreeBSD/powerpc specific) The following panic may occur at
boot-time on some older PowerMac G4 systems:

    ...
    KDB: current backend: ddb
    panic: Assertion curthread != NULL failed at
    /usr/src/sys/kern/kern_mutex.c:268
    KDB: enter panic

This is a known problem with no workaround, and will be fixed in the
next release.

(2005/11/5) Changes of on-disk format of /usr/share/locale/*/LC_* files
in 6.0-RELEASE prevent third-party software which uses setlocale(3) for
its localization from working after a 5.x system upgraded. The software
includes ones installed into the 5.x system by using FreeBSD Ports
Collection and so on. To solve this problem, perform one of the
following:

-   Install misc/compat5x package into the upgraded 6.0 system. This
    package installs a library lib/compat/libc.so.5 which makes the
    software complied in a 5.x system use the old locale files to keep
    compatibility. Note that you need to remove /lib/libc.so.5 after
    upgrading.

    This package is available only for Tier-1 platforms.

-   Recompile the software on the 6.0 system.

(2005/10/3) At boot time the FreeBSD/sparc64 GENERIC kernel may output
the following messages when the machine has no framebuffer:

    Aug 26 19:31:27 hostname getty[429]: open /dev/ttyv1: No such file or directory

This is because the machine with no supported graphics hardware does not
recognize syscons(4) and /dev/ttyv* device nodes are not created. This
is not a harmful error and can be suppressed by disabling /dev/ttyv*
entries in /etc/ttys.

(2005/10/3) Kernel modules do not work on FreeBSD/sparc64 when the
machine has more than 4GB memory. There is no workaround for this issue
except for compiling the modules statically into your custom kernel in
advance.

(2005/10/3) The kgdb(1) utility does not work properly on
FreeBSD/sparc64 for debugging panics which include traps. As a
workaround you can use devel/gdb53.
