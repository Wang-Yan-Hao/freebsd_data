Testing Guide for 4.9-RELEASE

Goals

As part of our on-going effort to improve the release engineering
process, we have identified several areas that need significant quality
assurance testing during the release candidate phase. Below, we've
listed the changes in 4.9-RELEASE that we feel merit the most attention
due to their involving substantial changes to the system, or having
arrived late in the development cycle leading up to the release. In
general, our goal in the QA process is to attempt to check a number of
things:

-   The system has not regressed with respects to stability,
    correctness, interoperability, or performance of features present in
    prior releases.
-   New features result in the desired improvement in stability,
    correctness, interoperability, or performance.

To effectively determine this, it's desirable to test the system in a
diverse set of environments, applying a wide set of workloads, forcing
the system to operate both within and outside its normal specification.
Particular focus should often be placed on the continuing (or new)
capability of the system to perform correctly when used in concert with
systems from other vendors.

Features to explore carefully:

-   A bug affecting IPFW2 "limit" rules was fixed very late in the
    release cycle; other ipfw2 features should not be affected. We are
    interested in hearing any feedback about IFPW2 in 4.9-RC3.

-   The sysinstall(8) utility was updated to support multiple mail
    transfer agents (MTAs). As such, the familiar Network Services menu
    was modified to expose a new option entitled Mail.

-   The xl driver has recently been updated with full busdma support
    among other improvements. This driver will now work with large
    memory systems with PAE enabled.

-   Users with large memory configurations (>4G) should explore the
    recently added PAE support in 4.9-RELEASE.

The release notes will always be a good place to look for things to
test.

Known Issues

-   The kernel hangs solidly during device configuration when certain
    SATA controllers are installed on the system. (patch)
-   4.9-PRE panics reproducibly on a heavily loaded ata(4)-system. PR
