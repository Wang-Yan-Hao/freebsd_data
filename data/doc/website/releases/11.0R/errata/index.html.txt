FreeBSD 11.0-RELEASE Errata

Abstract

This document lists errata items for FreeBSD 11.0-RELEASE, containing
significant information discovered after the release or too late in the
release cycle to be otherwise included in the release documentation.
This information includes security advisories, as well as news relating
to the software or documentation that could affect its operation or
usability. An up-to-date version of this document should always be
consulted before installing this version of FreeBSD.

This errata document for FreeBSD 11.0-RELEASE will be maintained until
the release of FreeBSD 11.0-RELEASE.

Introduction

This errata document contains "late-breaking news" about FreeBSD
11.0-RELEASE Before installing this version, it is important to consult
this document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems
that may already have been found and fixed.

Any version of this errata document actually distributed with the
release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be out of date by
definition, but other copies are kept updated on the Internet and should
be consulted as the "current errata" for this release. These other
copies of the errata are located at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/,
plus any sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.

Source and binary snapshots of FreeBSD 11.0-STABLE also contain
up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of the snapshot).

For a list of all FreeBSD CERT security advisories, see

Open Issues

-   An issue was discovered with Amazon EC2™ images which would cause
    the virtual machine to hang during boot when upgrading from previous
    FreeBSD versions. New EC2™ installations are not affected, but
    existing installations running earlier releases are advised to wait
    until the issue is resolved in an Errata Notice before upgrading. An
    Errata Notice to address this is planned following the release.

-   FreeBSD/i386 installed on ZFS may crash during boot when the ZFS
    pool mount is attempted while booting an unmodified GENERIC kernel.

    A system tunable has been added as of revision r286584 to make the
    kern.kstack_pages tunable configurable without recompiling the
    kernel.

    To mitigate system crashes with such configurations, chose
    Escape to loader prompt in the boot menu and enter the following
    lines from loader(8) prompt, after an OK:

        set kern.kstack_pages=4
        boot

    Add this line to /boot/loader.conf for the change to persist across
    reboots:

        kern.kstack_pages=4

-   A bug was diagnosed in interaction of the pmap_activate() function
    and TLB shootdown IPI handler on amd64 systems which have PCID
    features but do not implement the INVPCID instruction. On such
    machines, such as SandyBridge™ and IvyBridge™ microarchitectures,
    set the loader tunable vm.pmap.pcid_enabled=0 during boot:

        set vm.pmap.pcid_enabled=0
        boot

    Add this line to /boot/loader.conf for the change to persist across
    reboots:

    To check if the system is affected, check dmesg(8) for PCID listed
    in the "Features2", and absence of INVPCID in the "Structured
    Extended Features". If the PCID feature is not present, or INVPCID
    is present, system is not affected.

        vm.pmap.pcid_enabled=0

-   The Release Notes erroneously states the WITH_SYSTEM_COMPILER
    src.conf(5) option is enabled by default, however this was disabled
    prior to the final release build.

-   The release announcement stated "Wireless support for 802.11n has
    been added." This was intended to state "Wireless support for
    802.11n has been added for additional wireless network drivers."

-   Some release notes pertaining to the Cavium ThunderX platform (the
    FreeBSD/arm64 reference platform) were omitted:

    -   Support for the Cavium Virtualized NIC ethernet driver has been
        added. (r289550) (Sponsored by Cavium)

    -   Support for the GICv3 and ITS device drivers has been added.
        (r286919) (Sponsored by Cavium)

    -   Support for PCI Enhanced Allocation support has been added.
        (r296308) (Sponsored by Cavium)

-   [2016-10-20] Several recent Dell systems fail to find a bootable
    disk when the system boots in Legacy/BIOS/CSM mode, the boot disk is
    partitioned with GPT, and the Active flag in the Protective MBR is
    not set. To work around this issue, either configure the system to
    boot in UEFI mode, or choose the "GPT + Active" scheme. [r293860]

-   [2016-10-21] Support for sha512 and skein checksumming has been
    added to the ZFS filesystem. This was not mentioned in the release
    notes.

    Systems being upgraded from earlier FreeBSD releases with ZFS will
    see a message in zpool status output noting the pool is not at the
    latest version, and some features may not be enabled. Additional
    instructions on how to update ZFS pools to the latest version and
    update the boot blocks for all boot drives in the pool will also be
    provided in the output.

    This information is also documented in /usr/src/UPDATING, which is
    included if the src component is selected during installation.

-   [2016-10-21] The size of the GPT enabled ZFS boot blocks
    (/boot/gptzfsboot) has increased past 64K. Systems upgraded from
    older releases may experience a problem where the size of the
    existing "freebsd-boot" partition is too small to hold the new
    gptzfsboot.

    Systems where the boot partition is immediately followed by the swap
    partition, such as those installed via bsdinstall(8), can resize the
    swap partition slightly using the gpart(8) resize command, so space
    can be reclaimed to increase the size of the freebsd-boot partition.

-   [2016-10-21] Due to a bug in earlier versions of clang(1) that is
    difficult to work around in the upgrade process, to upgrade the
    system from sources via buildworld to -CURRENT or 11.0-RELEASE, it
    is necessary to upgrade machines running 9.x to at least revision
    r286035, or machines running 10.x to revision r286033. Source-based
    upgrades from 10.3-RELEASE are not affected. This differs from the
    historical situation where one could generally upgrade from anywhere
    on earlier stable branches, so caution should be exercised.
