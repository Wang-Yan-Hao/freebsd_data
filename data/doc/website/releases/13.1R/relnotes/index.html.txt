FreeBSD 13.1-RELEASE Release Notes

Abstract

The release notes for FreeBSD 13.1-RELEASE contain a summary of the
changes made to the FreeBSD base system on the 13-STABLE development
line. This document lists applicable security advisories that were
issued since the last release, as well as significant changes to the
FreeBSD kernel and userland. Some brief remarks on upgrading are also
presented.

Introduction

This document contains the release notes for FreeBSD 13.1-RELEASE. It
describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of FreeBSD. It
also provides some notes on upgrading from previous versions of FreeBSD.

The release distribution to which these release notes apply represents
the latest point along the 13-STABLE development branch since 13-STABLE
was created. Information regarding pre-built, binary release
distributions along this branch can be found at
https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/.

The release distribution to which these release notes apply represents a
point along the 13-STABLE development branch between 13.0-RELEASE and
the future 13.2-RELEASE. Information regarding pre-built, binary release
distributions along this branch can be found at
https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/.

This distribution of FreeBSD 13.1-RELEASE is a release distribution. It
can be found at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/ or any of its mirrors.
More information on obtaining this (or other) release distributions of
FreeBSD can be found in the Obtaining FreeBSD appendix to the FreeBSD
Handbook.

All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before installing
FreeBSD. The errata document is updated with "late-breaking" information
discovered late in the release cycle or after the release. Typically, it
contains information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections
to documentation. An up-to-date copy of the errata for FreeBSD
13.1-RELEASE can be found on the FreeBSD Web site.

This document describes the most user-visible new or changed features in
FreeBSD since 13.0-RELEASE. In general, changes described here are
unique to the 13-STABLE branch unless specifically marked as MERGED
features.

Typical release note items document recent security advisories issued
after 13.0-RELEASE, new drivers or hardware support, new commands or
options, major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades. They may
also list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering
practices. Clearly the release notes cannot list every single change
made to FreeBSD between releases; this document focuses primarily on
security advisories, user-visible changes, and major architectural
improvements.

Upgrading from Previous Releases of FreeBSD

Binary upgrades between RELEASE versions (and snapshots of the various
security branches) are supported using the freebsd-update(8) utility.
The binary upgrade procedure will update unmodified userland utilities,
as well as unmodified GENERIC kernels distributed as a part of an
official FreeBSD release. The freebsd-update(8) utility requires that
the host being upgraded have Internet connectivity.

Source-based upgrades (those based on recompiling the FreeBSD base
system from source code) from previous versions are supported, according
to the instructions in /usr/src/UPDATING.

Users of all powerpc architectures, after successful kernel and world
installation, will need to run manually "kldxref /boot/kernel".

Userland

This section covers changes and additions to userland applications,
contributed software, and system utilities.

Userland Configuration Changes

The -i flag is now added to rtsol(8) and rtsold(8) by default in
/etc/defaults/rc.conf. a0fc5094bf4c (Sponsored by
https://www.patreon.com/cperciva)

Userland Application Changes

The -i option has been added to rtsol(8) and rtsold(8) to disable the
random delay between zero and one seconds, speeding up the boot process.
8056b73ea163 (Sponsored by https://www.patreon.com/cperciva)

For 64-bit architectures, the base system is now built with Position
Independent Executable (PIE) support enabled by default. It may be
disabled using the WITHOUT_PIE knob. A clean build is required.
396e9f259d96

There is a new zfskeys rc(8) service script, which allows for automatic
decryption of ZFS datasets encrypted with ZFS native encryption during
boot. See the rc.conf(5) manual page for more information. 33ff39796ffe,
8719e8a951b7 (Sponsored by Modirum and Klara Inc.)

The NVMe emulation in bhyve(8) has been upgraded to version 1.4 of the
NVMe specification. b7a2cf0d9102 - eae02d959363

NVMe iovec construction for large IOs in bhyve(8) has been fixed. The
problem was exposed by the UEFI driver included with Rocky Linux 8.4.
a7761d19dacd

Extra Alt Gr mappings for Brazillian Portuguese ABNT2 keyboards were
added. 310623908c20

The chroot facility now supports unprivileged operation, and the
chroot(8) program now has a -n option to enable its use. 460b4b550dc9
(Sponsored by EPSRC)

The CAM library has been modified to use realpath(3) on device names
before parsing them, which allows tools such as camcontrol(8) and
smartctl(8) to be friendlier when symlinks are in use. e32acf95ea25

md5sum(1) and similar message-digest programs compatible with those on
Linux were added by having the corresponding BSD programs run with the
-r option if the program name ends in sum. c0d5665be0dc (Sponsored by
Netflix)

svnlite(1) is disabled in the build by default. a4f99b3c2384

mpsutil(8) has been extended to show adapter information and to control
NCQ. 395bc3598b47

Problems after downloading firmware to a device using camcontrol(8) were
fixed by forcing a rescan of the LUN after the firmware download.
327da43602cc (Sponsored by Netflix)

A new mode has been added to the scripted partition editor for variant
disk names in bsdinstall(8). If the disk parameter DEFAULT is set in
place of an actual device name, or no disk is specified for the
PARTITIONS parameter, the installer will follow the logic used in the
automatic-partitioning mode, in which it will either provide a selection
dialog for one of several disks if several are present or automatically
select it if there is only one. This simplifies the creation of
fully-automatic installation media for hardware or VMs with varying disk
names. 5ec4eb443e81

Contributed Software

Building of LLDB has been enabled on all powerpc architectures.
cb1bee9bd34

One True Awk has been updated to the latest from upstream (20210215).
All the FreeBSD patches but one have now been either upstreamed or
discarded. Notable changes include:

-   Locale is no longer used for ranges

-   Various bugs fixed

-   Better compatibility with gawk and mawk

The one remaining FreeBSD change, likely to be removed in FreeBSD 14, is
that we still allow hex numbers, prefixed with 0x, to be parsed and
interpreted as hex numbers, while all other awks (now including One True
Awk) interpret them as 0, in line with awk’s historic behavior.

zlib has been upgraded to version 1.2.12.

libarchive has been upgraded to verion 3.6.0 with additional bug and
security fixes from the upcoming patchlevel release. Release notes are
available at https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/releases.

The ssh package has been updated to OpenSSH v8.8p1, including a security
update and bug fixes. Other updates include these changes:

-   ssh(1): When prompting whether to record a new host key, accept that
    key’s fingerprint as a synonym for "yes."

-   ssh-keygen(1): When acting as a CA and signing certificates with an
    RSA key, default to using the rsa-sha2-512 signature algorithm.

-   ssh(1): UpdateHostkeys is enabled by default, subject to some
    conservative preconditions.

-   scp(1): The behavior of remote to remote copies (e.g.
    scp host-a:/path host-b:) has been changed to transfer through the
    local host by default.

-   scp(1) has experimental support for transfers using the SFTP
    protocol as a replacement for the venerable SCP/RCP protocol that it
    has traditionally used.

The use of FIDO/U2F hardware authenticators has been enabled in ssh,
using the new public key types ecdsa-sk and ed25519-sk, along with
corresponding certificate types. FIDO/U2F support is described in
https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-8.2. a613d68fff9a (Sponsored by The
FreeBSD Foundation)

Runtime Libraries and API

Assembly optimized code for OpenSSL has been added on powerpc, powerpc64
and powerpc64le. ce35a3bc852

The detection of CPU features accelerating crypto operations for ARMv7
and ARM64 has been fixed, speeding up aes-256-gcm and sha256
substantially. 32a2fed6e71f (Sponsored by Ampere Computing LLC and Klara
Inc.)

Building ASAN and UBSAN libraries has been enabled on riscv64 and
riscv64sf. 8c56b338da7

OFED libraries are now built on riscv64 and riscv64sf. 2b978245733

OPENMP libraries are now built on riscv64 and riscv64sf. aaf56e35569

8934d3e7b9b9

Supported Platforms

Support has been added for the HiFive Unmatched RISC-V board.

Storage

This section covers changes and additions to file systems and other
storage subsystems, both local and networked.

General Storage

ZFS Changes

ZFS has been upgraded to OpenZFS release 2.1.4. OpenZFS release notes
can be found at https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/releases.

NFS Changes

Two new daemons, rpc.tlsclntd(8) and rpc.tlsservd(8), are now built by
default on amd64 and arm64. They provide support for NFS-over-TLS as
described in the Internet Draft entitled "Towards Remote Procedure Call
Encryption By Default". These daemons are built when WITH_OPENSSL_KTLS
is specified. They use KTLS to encrypt/decrypt all NFS RPC message
traffic, and provide optional verification of machine identity via X.509
certificates. 2c76eebca71b 59f6f5e23c1a

The default minor version used for an NFSv4 mount has been changed to
the highest minor version supported by the NFSv4 server. This default
can be overridden by using the minorversion mount option. 8a04edfdcbd2

A new NFSv4.1/4.2 mount option nconnect has been added that can be used
to specify the number of TCP connections that will be used for the
mount, up to a maximum of 16. The first (default) TCP connection will be
used for all RPCs that consist of small RPC messages. The RPCs that can
consist of large RPC messages (Read/Readdir/ReaddirPlus/Write) will be
sent on the additional TCP connections in a round-robin fashion. If
either the NFS client or NFS server have multiple network interfaces
aggregated together, or a network interface that uses multiple queues,
this can increase NFS performance for the mount. 9ec7dbf46b0a

A sysctl called vfs.nfsd.srvmaxio has been added that can be used to
increase the NFS server’s maximum I/O size from 128Kbytes to any power
of 2 up to 1Mbyte. It can only be set when the nfsd threads are not
running, and will normally require an increase in kern.ipc.maxsockbuf to
at least the value recommended by the console log message generated when
setting vfs.nfsd.srvmaxio is first attempted. 9fb6e613373c

UFS Changes

Following 5cc52631b3b8, fsck_ffs(8) did not work for background fsck in
preen mode where UFS was tuned for soft updates without soft update
journaling. Fixed: fb2feceac34c

Boot Loader Changes

This section covers the boot loader, boot menu, and other boot-related
changes.

Boot Loader Changes

UEFI boot is improved for amd64. The loader detects whether the loaded
kernel can handle the in-place staging area (non-copying mode). The
default is copy_staging auto. Auto-detection can be overridden, for
example: with copy_staging enable, the loader will unconditionally copy
the staging area to 2M, regardless of kernel capabilities. Also, the
code to grow the staging area is more robust; for growth to occur, it’s
no longer necessary to hand-tune and recompile the loader. (Sponsored by
The FreeBSD Foundation)

boot1 and loader have been fixed on powerpc64le. 8a62b07bce7

Other Boot Changes

Performance improvements have been made to loader(8), nvme(4),
random(4), rtsold(8), and x86 clock calibration, which collectively
yield a significant speedup in system boot time. Configuration changes
on the EC2 platform provide additional benefits, resulting in
13.1-RELEASE booting over twice as fast as 13.0-RELEASE. (Sponsored by
https://www.patreon.com/cperciva)

EC2 images are now built by default to boot using UEFI instead of legacy
BIOS. Note that UEFI is not supported by Xen-based EC2 instances or by
"bare metal" EC2 instances. 65f22ccf8247 (Sponsored by
https://www.patreon.com/cperciva)

Support was added for recording EC2 AMI Ids in the AWS Systems Manager
Parameter Store. FreeBSD will be using the public prefix
/aws/service/freebsd, resulting in parameter names which look like
/aws/service/freebsd/amd64/base/ufs/13.1/RELEASE. 242d1c32e42c
(Sponsored by https://www.patreon.com/cperciva)

Networking

This section describes changes that affect networking in FreeBSD.

General Network

The handling of the lowest address on an IPv4 (sub)net (host 0) has been
changed so that packets are not sent as a broadcast unless this address
has been set as the broadcast address. This makes the lowest address
usable for a host. The old behavior can be restored with the
net.inet.ip.broadcast_lowest sysctl. See
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-schoen-intarea-unicast-lowest-address/
for background information. 3ee882bf21af

General Notes Regarding Future FreeBSD Releases

Default CPUTYPE Change

Starting with FreeBSD-13.0, the default CPUTYPE for the i386
architecture will change from 486 to 686.

This means that, by default, binaries produced will require a 686-class
CPU, including but not limited to binaries provided by the FreeBSD
Release Engineering team. FreeBSD 13.0 will continue to support older
CPUs, however users needing this functionality will need to build their
own releases for official support.

As the primary use for i486 and i586 CPUs is generally in the embedded
market, the general end-user impact is expected to be minimal, as new
hardware with these CPU types has long faded, and much of the deployed
base of such systems is nearing retirement age, statistically.

There were several factors taken into account for this change. For
example, i486 does not have 64-bit atomics, and while they can be
emulated in the kernel, they cannot be emulated in the userland.
Additionally, the 32-bit amd64 libraries have been i686 since their
inception.

As the majority of 32-bit testing is done by developers using the lib32
libraries on 64-bit hardware with the COMPAT_FREEBSD32 option in the
kernel, this change ensures better coverage and user experience. This
also aligns with what the majority of Linux® distributions have been
doing for quite some time.

This is expected to be the final bump of the default CPUTYPE in i386.
