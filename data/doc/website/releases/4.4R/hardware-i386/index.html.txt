FreeBSD 4.4-RELEASE i386 Hardware Notes

The FreeBSD Documentation Project

Copyright © 2000, 2001 by The FreeBSD Documentation Project

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 Introduction

This document contains the hardware compatability notes for FreeBSD
4.4-RELEASE on the i386 hardware platform. It lists devices known to
work on this platform, as well as some notes on boot-time kernel
customization that may be useful when attempting to configure support
for new devices.

  Note: This document includes information specific to the i386 hardware
  platform. Versions of the hardware compatability notes for other
  architectures will differ in some details.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2 Supported Processors and Motherboards

FreeBSD for the i386 currently runs on a wide variety of ISA, VLB, EISA,
MCA and PCI bus based PC's, ranging from 386sx to Pentium 4 class
machines (though the 386sx is not recommended).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3 Supported Devices

$FreeBSD: src/release/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/hardware/common/dev.sgml,v
1.13.2.14 2001/09/06 23:17:00 bmah Exp $

This section describes the devices currently known to be supported by
with FreeBSD on the i386 platform. Other configurations may also work,
but simply have not been tested yet. Feedback, updates, and corrections
to this list are encouraged.

Where possible, the drivers applicable to each device or class of
devices is listed. If the driver in question has a manual page in the
FreeBSD base distribution (most should), it is referenced here.

4 Boot-time Kernel Configuration

This section describes the boot-time configuration of the FreeBSD
kernel.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.1 Default Configuration

The following table contains a list of all of the devices that are
present in the GENERIC kernel. This is the essential part of the
operating system that is placed in your root partition during the
installation process. A compressed version of the GENERIC kernel is also
used on the installation floppy diskette and DOS boot image.

The table describes the various parameters used by the driver to
communicate with the hardware in your system. There are four parameters
in the table, though not all are used by each and every device:

  ------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Port    The starting I/O port used by the device, shown in hexadecimal.
  IRQ     The interrupt the device uses to alert the driver to an event, given in decimal.
  DRQ     The DMA (direct memory access) channel the device uses to move data to and from main memory, also given in decimal.
  IOMem   The lowest (or starting) memory address used by the device, also shown in hexadecimal.
  ------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If an entry in the table has `n/a' for a value then it means that the
parameter in question does not apply to that device. A value of `dyn'
means that the correct value should be determined automatically by the
kernel when the system boots and that you don't need to worry about it.

If an entry is marked with an *, it means that support is currently not
available for it but should be back as soon as someone converts the
driver to work within the new (post-4.0) framework.

If the hardware in your computer is not set to the same settings as
those shown in the table and the item in conflict is not marked 'dyn',
you will have to either reconfigure your hardware or use UserConfig to
reconfigure the kernel to match the way your hardware is currently set
(see the next section).

If the settings do not match, the kernel may be unable to locate or
reliably access the devices in your system.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.2 Using UserConfig to change FreeBSD kernel settings

  Note: The markup for this section leaves a lot to be desired.

The FreeBSD kernel on the install floppy contains drivers for every
piece of hardware that could conceivably be used to install the rest of
the system with. Unfortunately, PC hardware being what it is, some of
these devices can be difficult to detect accurately, and for some, the
process of detecting another can cause irreversible confusion.

To make this process easier, FreeBSD provides UserConfig. With this tool
the user can configure and disable device drivers before the kernel is
loaded, avoiding potential conflicts, and eliminating the need to
reconfigure hardware to suit the default driver settings.

Once FreeBSD is installed, it will remember the changes made using
UserConfig, so that they only need be made once.

It is important to disable drivers that are not relevant to a system in
order to minimize the possibility of interference, which can cause
problems that are difficult to track down.

UserConfig features a command line interface for users with serial
consoles or a need to type commands, and a full screen ``visual''
interface, which provides point-and-shoot configuration functionality.

Here is a sample UserConfig screen shot in ``visual'' mode:

        ---Active Drivers---------------------------10 Conflicts------Dev---IRQ--Port--
         Storage :  (Collapsed)
         Network :
          NE1000,NE2000,3C503,WD/SMC80xx Ethernet adapters    CONF  ed0       5  0x280

         Communications : (Collapsed)

        ---Parameters-for-device-ed0---------------------------------------------------
         Port address : 0x280      Memory address : 0xd8000
         IRQ number   : 5          Memory size    : 0x2000
         Flags        : 0x0000
        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          IO Port address (Hexadecimal, 0x1-0x2000)
          [TAB]   Change fields           [Q]   Save device parameters

The screen is divided into four sections:

-   Active Drivers. Listed here are the device drivers that are
    currently enabled, and their basic parameters.

-   Inactive Drivers. These drivers are present, but are disabled.

-   Parameter edit field. This area is used for editing driver
    parameters.

-   Help area. Keystroke help is displayed here.

One of the Active and Inactive lists is always in use, and the current
entry in the list will be shown with a highlight bar. If there are more
entries in a list than can be shown, it will scroll. The bar can be
moved up and down using the cursor keys, and moved between lists with
the TAB key.

Drivers in the Active list may be marked CONF. This indicates that one
or more of their parameters conflicts with another device, and indicates
a potential for problems. The total number of conflicts is displayed at
the top of the screen.

As a general rule, conflicts should be avoided, either by disabling
conflicting devices that are not present in the system, or by altering
their configuration so that they match the installed hardware.

In the list areas, drivers are grouped by their basic function. Groups
can be Collapsed to simplify the display (this is the default state for
all groups). If a group is collapsed, it will be shown with Collapsed in
the list, as above. To Expand a Collapsed group, position the highlight
bar over the group heading and press Enter. To Collapse it again, repeat
the process.

When a device driver in the Active list is highlighted, its full
parameters are displayed in the Parameter edit area. Note that not all
drivers use all possible parameters, and some hardware supported by
drivers may not use all the parameters the driver supports.

To disable a driver, go to the Active list, Expand the group it is in,
highlight the driver and press Del. The driver will move to its group in
the Inactive list. (If the group is collapsed or off the screen, you may
not see the driver in its new location.)

To enable a driver, go to the Inactive list, Expand the group it is in,
highlight the driver and press Enter. The highlight will move to the
Active list, and the driver you have just enabled will be highlighted,
ready to be configured.

To configure a driver, go to the Active list, Expand the group it is in,
highlight the driver and press Enter. The cursor will move to the
Parameter edit area, and the device's parameters may be edited.

While editing parameters, the TAB and cursor keys can be used to move
between fields. Most numeric values (except IRQ) are entered in
hexadecimal, as indicated by the '0x' at the beginning of the field. The
allowable values for a given field are show in the Key Help area when
the field is active.

To finish configuring a driver, press 'Q'.

Note that PCI, Microchannel and EISA devices can be probed reliably,
therefore they are not shown in the table above nor can their settings
be changed using UserConfig.
