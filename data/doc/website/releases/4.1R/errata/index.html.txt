FreeBSD 4.1 Errata Notes

    If you read no other documentation before installing this
    version of FreeBSD, you should at least by all means *READ
    THE ERRATA* for this release so that you don't stumble over
    problems which have already been found and fixed.  This ERRATA.TXT
    file is obviously already out of date by definition, but other
    copies are kept updated on the net and should be consulted as
    the "current errata" for your release.  These other copies of
    the errata are located at:

      1. http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/

      2. ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/<your-release>/ERRATA.TXT
         (and any sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location).

    Any changes to this file are also automatically emailed to:

        freebsd-current@FreeBSD.org

    For all FreeBSD security advisories, see:

        http://www.FreeBSD.org/security/

    for the latest security incident information.

    ---- Security Advisories:

    Current active security advisories: None

    ---- System Update Information:

    The FreeBSD Boot Manager (boot0) has a bug that causes it to hang the machine
    during boot with no screen output.

    Fix: Boot your machine into FreeBSD either via a boot floppy or a CD-ROM, then
    download a new boot0 binary from the following location:

        http://people.FreeBSD.org/~jhb/4.1R/i386/boot0

    Once you have downloaded the new binary, install it with the boot0cfg command
    onto your hard disk.  For example, if you have boot0 on disk ad0, you would
    run the following command:

        /usr/sbin/boot0cfg -B -b /path/to/downloaded/boot0 ad0

    You may also use cvsup to update your source tree and build the new boot0
    binary from source.  You will need version 1.14.2.3 of
    src/sys/boot/i386/boot0/boot0.s or newer.

    The MD5 checksum of this file is:

        MD5 (boot0) = 8770a386dba44f0aa06b15db72c1f624

    To verify the checksum of your downloaded copy, perform the following
    command:

        /sbin/md5 /path/to/downloaded/boot0

    and compare with the above.
