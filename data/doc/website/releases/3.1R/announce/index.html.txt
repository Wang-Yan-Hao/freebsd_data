FreeBSD 3.1 Announcement

Date: Mon, 15 Feb 1999 12:00:03 -0700
From: "Jordan K. Hubbard" <jkh@freebsd.org>
Subject:FreeBSD 3.1 is now released!

We are pleased, as always, to announce the availability of 3.1-RELEASE,
the much anticipated follow-on release to FreeBSD 3.0 (released
November, 1998). Many hundreds of bug fixes and general enhancements
have been made to the system so please see the release notes for more
information.

FreeBSD 3.1-RELEASE is available on ftp.freebsd.org and various FTP
mirror sites throughout the world. It can also be ordered on CD from
Walnut Creek CDROM, from where it will be shipping shortly as a 4 CD set
containing a lot of extra stuff of interest to programmers and general
users alike.

IMPORTANT NOTE: All of the profits from the sales of this CD set go to
support the FreeBSD Project!

Like many businesses in the field of high-tech, Walnut Creek CDROM has
realized that in order to make any product for an emerging market grow,
you have to make a significant investment in such growth, even if it
means abandoning short-term profits. Walnut Creek CDROM is the only
CDROM vendor who currently does anything like this and it’s certainly my
hope that you will help support the project by buying (or getting
someone else to buy :) one of their CDs. Thanks!

The official FTP distribution site for FreeBSD is:

  ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD

Or via the WEB page at:

  http://www.cdrom.com

And on CD-ROM from Walnut Creek CDROM:

  Walnut Creek CDROM
  4041 Pike Lane, #F
  Concord CA, 94520 USA
  Phone: +1 925 674-0783
  Fax: +1 925 674-0821
  Tech Support: +1 925 603-1234
  Email: info@cdrom.com
  WWW: http://www.cdrom.com/

If you are in Japan, please refer to Pacific HiTech for information on
ordering a localized (or the english) version of the 3.1 product when it
becomes available. Pacific HiTech is now an affiliate of Walnut Creek
CDROM for Japanese sales of FreeBSD.

Additionally, FreeBSD is available via anonymous FTP from mirror sites
in the following countries: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria,
Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany,
Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Korea, Latvia,
Malaysia, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovenia,
South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand, the Ukraine and the
United Kingdom (and quite possibly several others which I’ve never even
heard of :).

Before trying the central FTP site, please check your regional mirror(s)
first by going to:

  ftp://ftp.<yourdomain>.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD

Any additional mirror sites will be labeled ftp2, ftp3 and so on.

The latest versions of export-restricted code for FreeBSD (2.0C or
later) (eBones and secure) are also being made available at the
following locations. If you are outside the U.S. or Canada, please get
secure (DES) and eBones (Kerberos) from one of the following foreign
distribution sites:

South Africa

    ftp://ftp.internat.FreeBSD.ORG/pub/FreeBSD
    ftp://ftp2.internat.FreeBSD.ORG/pub/FreeBSD

Brazil

    ftp://ftp.br.FreeBSD.ORG/pub/FreeBSD

Finland

    ftp://nic.funet.fi/pub/unix/FreeBSD/eurocrypt
