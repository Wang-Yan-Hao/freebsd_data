FreeBSD 2.2.5 Announcement

Date: 22 Oct 1997 14:09:08 -0500
From: "Jordan K. Hubbard" <jkh@time.cdrom.com>
Subject: 2.2.5 RELEASE now available from ftp.freebsd.org (and some
mirrors)

It is my great pleasure, as always, to announce the release of FreeBSD
2.2.5, our next release on the 2.2-stable branch. Those folks who are
still running 2.1.x and wish to upgrade to 2.2 technology are now
encouraged to do so as 2.2.5 has reached an equivalent level of
stability in all of our tests. A number of annoying problems with 2.2.2
have also been fixed (see the release notes for more information on
this).

FreeBSD 2.2.5-RELEASE is available on ftp.freebsd.org and various FTP
mirror sites throughout the world. It can also be ordered on CD from
Walnut Creek CDROM, from where it will be shipping shortly as a new 4 CD
set containing a lot of extra stuff of interest to programmers and
general users alike.

The official FTP distribution site for FreeBSD is:

  ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD

Or via the WEB page at:

  http://www.cdrom.com/pub/FreeBSD

And on CD-ROM from Walnut Creek CDROM:

  Walnut Creek CDROM
  4041 Pike Lane, #D
  Concord CA, 94520 USA
  Phone: +1 510 674-0783
  Fax: +1 510 674-0821
  Tech Support: +1 510 603-1234
  Email: info@cdrom.com
  WWW: http://www.cdrom.com/

Additionally, FreeBSD is available via anonymous FTP from mirror sites
in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark,
Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Japan,
Korea, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Russia, South Africa, Sweden,
Taiwan, Thailand and the UK (among other countries :). Please check your
regional mirrors first by going to:

  ftp://ftp.<yourdomain>.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD

since ftp.freebsd.org is itself rather overloaded at the present time
(Id software and Slackware Linux chose the same time to release their
latest products :).

The latest versions of export-restricted code for FreeBSD (2.0C or
later) (eBones and secure) are also being made available at the
following locations. If you are outside the U.S. or Canada, please get
secure (DES) and eBones (Kerberos) from one of the following foreign
distribution sites:

South Africa

    ftp://ftp.internat.FreeBSD.ORG/pub/FreeBSD
    ftp://ftp2.internat.FreeBSD.ORG/pub/FreeBSD

Brazil

    ftp://ftp.br.FreeBSD.ORG/pub/FreeBSD

Finland

    ftp://nic.funet.fi/pub/unix/FreeBSD/eurocrypt
