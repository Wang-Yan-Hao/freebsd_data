This information includes security advisories, as well as news relating
to the software or documentation that could affect its operation or
usability. An up-to-date version of this document should always be
consulted before installing this version of FreeBSD.

Introduction

This errata document contains "late-breaking news" about FreeBSD
11.3-RELEASE. Before installing this version, it is important to consult
this document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems
that may already have been found and fixed.

Any version of this errata document actually distributed with the
release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be out of date by
definition, but other copies are kept updated on the Internet and should
be consulted as the "current errata" for this release. These other
copies of the errata are located at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/,
plus any sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.

Source and binary snapshots of FreeBSD 11.3-STABLE also contain
up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of the snapshot).

For a list of all FreeBSD CERT security advisories, see
https://www.FreeBSD.org/security/.

Open Issues

-   [2019-07-04] An issue which can cause a crash when connecting to a
    bhyve(4) instance with a VNC client under certain circumstances had
    been reported. An errata notice is planned post-release.

-   [2019-07-04] An issue booting bhyve(4) virtual machines compiled
    with clang(1) version 8.0.0 or later had been reported late in the
    release cycle. An errata notice is planned post-release.

    This issue is believed to only affect OpenBSD virtual machines
    compiled with clang(1).

-   [2019-07-04] An issue when upgrading from FreeBSD 11.3 to FreeBSD
    12.0 (which occurred earlier in time, comparatively), had been
    reported where the com.delphix:spacemap_v2 zpool(8) feature does not
    exist on FreeBSD 12.0, will fail to import the ZFS pool.

    At this time, it is advised to defer migrating from FreeBSD 11.3 to
    FreeBSD 12.x until FreeBSD 12.1 is available.

    Upgrading from earlier FreeBSD 11.x releases to FreeBSD 12.0 are
    believed to be unaffected.

Late-Breaking News

-   [2019-12-06] An issue has been reported with the FreeBSD
    11.3-RELEASE images on the Google Compute Engine platform which
    causes virtual machines to fail to start properly.

    While we intend to investigate how to handle similar situations
    should they arise in the future, updated images will not be provided
    as of this time.

    Users wanting to use FreeBSD in Google Compute Engine are advised to
    use 12.0-RELEASE or 12.1-RELEASE, or for those who wish to track
    11.`X`, the freebsd-11-3-stable-amd64-v20190801 snapshot from
    stable/11 has been reported to work correctly.

    More details can be found in PR 242303.
