FreeBSD 11.3-RELEASE Release Notes

Abstract

The release notes for FreeBSD 11.3-RELEASE contain a summary of the
changes made to the FreeBSD base system on the 11.3-STABLE development
line. This document lists applicable security advisories that were
issued since the last release, as well as significant changes to the
FreeBSD kernel and userland. Some brief remarks on upgrading are also
presented.

Introduction

This document contains the release notes for FreeBSD 11.3-RELEASE. It
describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of FreeBSD. It
also provides some notes on upgrading from previous versions of FreeBSD.

This distribution of FreeBSD 11.3-RELEASE is a release distribution. It
can be found at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/ or any of its mirrors.
More information on obtaining this (or other) release distributions of
FreeBSD can be found in the Obtaining FreeBSD' appendix to the FreeBSD
Handbook.

All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before installing
FreeBSD. The errata document is updated with "late-breaking" information
discovered late in the release cycle or after the release. Typically, it
contains information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections
to documentation. An up-to-date copy of the errata for FreeBSD
11.3-RELEASE can be found on the FreeBSD Web site.

This document describes the most user-visible new or changed features in
FreeBSD since 11.2-RELEASE. In general, changes described here are
unique to the 11.3-STABLE branch unless specifically marked as MERGED
features.

Typical release note items document recent security advisories issued
after 11.2-RELEASE, new drivers or hardware support, new commands or
options, major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades. They may
also list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering
practices. Clearly the release notes cannot list every single change
made to FreeBSD between releases; this document focuses primarily on
security advisories, user-visible changes, and major architectural
improvements.

Upgrading from Previous Releases of FreeBSD

[amd64,i386] Binary upgrades between RELEASE versions (and snapshots of
the various security branches) are supported using the freebsd-update(8)
utility. The binary upgrade procedure will update unmodified userland
utilities, as well as unmodified GENERIC kernels distributed as a part
of an official FreeBSD release. The freebsd-update(8) utility requires
that the host being upgraded have Internet connectivity.

Source-based upgrades (those based on recompiling the FreeBSD base
system from source code) from previous versions are supported, according
to the instructions in /usr/src/UPDATING.

Important: Upgrading FreeBSD should only be attempted after backing up
all data and configuration files.

Security and Errata

This section lists the various Security Advisories and Errata Notices
since 11.2-RELEASE.

Userland

This section covers changes and additions to userland applications,
contributed software, and system utilities.

Userland Configuration Changes

The jail(8) utility has been updated to include a new jail.conf(5)
parameter, allow.read_msgbuf, which prevents jailed processes and users
from accessing the dmesg(8) buffer. This parameter is set to false by
default. (r339446)

The system crontab(5), /etc/crontab, has been updated to set PATH for
consistency with the cron(8) daemon. (r342103)

The default devd.conf(5) has been updated to prevent duplicated
hostapd(8) and wpa_supplicant(8) startup via devd(8). (r343469)

A new variable, init_exec, has been added to kenv(1), allowing init(8)
to run an executable file after opening the console, replacing init(8)
as PID 1. (r346479)

Userland Application Changes

The cpuset(1), sockstat(1), ipfw(8), and ugidfw(8) utilities have been
updated to support jail(8) names. (r336040)

The newfs_msdos(8) utililty has been updated to include a new flag, -T,
which is used to specify the timestamp for build reproducibility.
(r336328)

The dd(1) utility has been updated to add a new
status`operand, `progress, which reports the current status on a single
line every second. (r338364)

The last(1) utility has been updated to include libxo(3) support.
(r338451)

The lastlogin(8) utility has been updated to include libxo(3) support.
(r338452)

The traceroute(8) utility has been updated to include libcasper(3)
support. (r338475)

The diff(1) utility has been updated to implement -B and
--ignore-blank-lines support. (r339160)

The makewhatis(1) utility has been updated to prevent operating within
read-only directories. (r340963)

The jail(8) utility has been updated to add a new flag, -e, which takes
a jail.conf(5) parameter as an argument and prints a list of
non-wildcard jails with the specified parameter. (r341790)

The ktrdump(8) utility has been updated to include the -l flag which
enables "live" mode when specified. (r342706)

The trim(8) utility has been added, which deletes content for blocks on
flash-based storage devices that use wear-leveling algorithms. (r343118)

The gzip(1) utility has been updated to add -l support for xz(1) files.
(r343251)

The newfs(8) and tunefs(8) utilities have been updated to allow
underscores in label names. (r343538) (Sponsored by Netflix)

The pfctl(8) utility has been updated to provide clearer output and
reference the net.pf.request_maxcount sysctl(8) if a defined table is
too large. (r344020)

The newfs(8) and tunefs(8) utilities have been updated to allow dashes
in label names. (r344052)

The fdisk(8) utility has been updated to support sectors larger than
2048 bytes. (r344490)

The sh(1) utility has been updated to add the pipefail option which
simplifies checking the exit status of all commands in a pipeline.
(r345561)

The patch(1) utility has been updated to exit successfully if the input
patch file is zero-length. (r345878)

The spi(8) utility has been added, which is used to communicate with
devices on an SPI bus through the userland. (r346518)

Contributed Software

The xz(1) utility has been updated to version 5.2.4. (r334607)

The file(1) utility has been updated to version 5.34. (r337827)

The ELF Tool Chain has been updated to version r3614. (r338414)
(Sponsored by The FreeBSD Foundation)

The lld utility has been updated to add -z interpose, marking the object
