FreeBSD 2.1 Announcement

Date: Sun, 19 Nov 1995 14:48:46 -0800
From: "Jordan K. Hubbard" <jkh@freebsd.org>
To: announce@freefall.cdrom.com
Subject: 2.1.0-RELEASE now available!

Could it be? Could the long-awaited release of FreeBSD 2.1 truly have
arrived?

It gives me great pleasure to answer those questions with a ``yes!''

FreeBSD 2.1.0-RELEASE is now available on ftp.freebsd.org and various
FTP mirror sites throughout the world. It can also be ordered on CD from
Walnut Creek CDROM, from where it will be shipping shortly.

FreeBSD 2.1 represents the culmination of 6 months worth of work on the
2.1-STABLE branch of FreeBSD since the previous release (FreeBSD 2.0.5).

The STABLE branch was conceived out of the need to allow FreeBSD to grow
and support long-term development projects like devfs, NFSv3, IPX,
PCCARD, etc. while at the same time not jeopardizing the stability of
its existing user base. Experimental or high-impact changes are allowed
into FreeBSD-current, which represents a sort of shared group
development tree, and only well tested or obvious fixes are allowed into
STABLE. In a few rare cases, where some bit of functionality was
entirely missing before, we’ve supplied an ALPHA test quality version in
STABLE on the premise that some functionality is better than none at all
(a good example being the IDE CDROM driver).

For more information on the 2.1 release itself, please consult the
documentation that accompanies the installation procedure.
