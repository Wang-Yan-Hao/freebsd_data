Testing foci for 6.2-RELEASE

  ------------------------------------ --------------- --------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Issue                                Status          Responsible                                               Description
  bce(4) stability fixes               Needs testing   Scott Long                                                Several stability fixes for bce(4) were merged from HEAD to RELENG_6 around 20061024. Initial testing results have been promising, but more testing reports would be useful.
  em(4) stability fixes                Needs testing   Scott Long, Jack F. Vogel, Gleb Smirnoff, Kris Kennaway   Several difficult-to-diagnose stability issues have been observed in the em(4) driver since August. As of 20061027, a newer driver provided by Intel (version 6.2.9) has been committed to RELENG_6 for testing. UPDATE: Additional changes committed 20061110 fix some other observed stability problems and restore missing jumbo frame functionality.
  sysinstall(8) kernel selection fix   Needs testing   Erwin Lansing                                             A bug in sysinstall(8) could result in it failing to install a kernel on a new disk if the user did not choose a distribution from the distribution menu. This is believed to have been fixed as of 20061029, but could use more testing.
  ggated(8)                            Needs testing   Paweł Jakub Dawidek                                       A recently-committed patch to ggated(8) is believed to fix some fairly serious problems, as reported in PR kern/104829.
  devfs(5) fixes                       Needs testing   Konstantin Belousov                                       Several deadlocks and locking bugs have been fixed in devfs(5).
  tty(4) fixes                         Needs testing   Martin Blapp                                              Several workarounds have been committed for known problems in the tty(4) layer.
