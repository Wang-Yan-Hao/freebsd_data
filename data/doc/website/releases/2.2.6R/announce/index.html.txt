From: "Jordan K. Hubbard" <jkh@time.cdrom.com>
Subject: 2.2.6 RELEASE now available from ftp.freebsd.org (and some
mirrors)

As always, it’s my great pleasure to announce the release of FreeBSD
2.2.6, our latest release on the 2.2-stable branch and the result of
over 4 months of work since 2.2.5 was released. See the release notes
for a list of significant changes since the previous release.

FreeBSD 2.2.6-RELEASE is available on ftp.freebsd.org and various FTP
mirror sites throughout the world. It can also be ordered on CD from
Walnut Creek CDROM, from where it will be shipping shortly as a 4 CD set
containing a lot of extra stuff of interest to the programmer and
general user alike.

The official FTP distribution site for FreeBSD is:

  ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD

Or via the WEB page at:
