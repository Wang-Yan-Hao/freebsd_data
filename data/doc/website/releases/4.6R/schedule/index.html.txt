Schedule

  ---------------------------------------- -------------- -------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Action                                   Expected       Actual         Description
  Reminder announcement                    01 Apr 2002    09 Apr 2002    Release Engineers send announcement email to developers@FreeBSD.org with a rough schedule for the FreeBSD 4.6 release.
  4.6-PRERELEASE Testing Guide published   Ongoing        --             A testing guide should be published with information about recent changes and areas of the system that should be thoroughly tested during the pre-release/RC period.
  4.6-PRERELEASE                           01 May 2002    01 May 2002    newvers.sh, and release.ent updated.
  FTP site updated                         01 May 2002    18 May 2002    pkg_add -r works for 4.6-PRERELEASE machines.
  Code freeze begins                       01 May 2002    01 May 2002    After this date, all commits to the RELENG_4 branch must be approved by re@FreeBSD.org. Certain highly active documentation committers are exempt from this rule for routine man page / release note updates. Heads-up emails should be sent to the developers@, stable@ and qa@ lists.
  Commercial software demos updated.       15 May 2002    --             The second disc contains commercial software demos, these demos should be updated to contain the latest versions.
  4.6-RC                                   15 May 2002    15 May 2002    newvers.sh and release.ent updated.
  Announce the Ports Freeze                15 May 2002    19 May 2002    Someone from portmgr should email freebsd-ports@ and BCC: developers@ to set a date for the week long ports freeze and tagging of the ports tree.
  Heads up to hubs                         28 May 2002    --             A message should be sent to freebsd-hubs@FreeBSD.org before the release is uploaded. The site administrators have frequently requested advance notice for new ISOs.
  First release candidate                  16 May 2002    17 May 2002    The first release candidate for the x86 and Alpha architecture is released. ISO images should be uploaded to ftp-master.FreeBSD.org and releng4.FreeBSD.org. A network install directory should be uploaded to ftp-master.FreeBSD.org. The packages/ and XF86336/ directories may be symlinked to save space, as long as you're sure to use relative symlinks.
  Heads up to -stable                      17 May 2002    17 May 2002    A message should be sent to qa@FreeBSD.org and stable@FreeBSD.org after the snapshot is uploaded.
  Package split posted                     17 May 2002    --             The proposed package split (which packages go on which disc of the 4 CD set) should be posted to qa@FreeBSD.org, ports@FreeBSD.org, and stable@FreeBSD.org.
  Second release candidate                 ?? May 2002    18 May 2002    Note: the release date of this candidate depends on the user experience with RC1.
  Third release candidate                  --             --             There will be no 4.6 RC3 snapshot.
  Ports tree frozen.                       24 May 2002    25 May 2002    CVSROOT/avail locks out everyone but the person who does the tagging. It will take approximately 2 hours to tag the entire ports tree with the RELEASE_4_6_0 tag. After this time, the ports/ tree will be re-opened for commits, but commits made after tagging will not go in 4.6-RELEASE.
  Final package build starts               25 May 2002    --             The ports cluster and bento build final packages.
  Package split                            26 May 2002    --             The packages must be split so that packages with similar dependencies appear on each of the four discs, with the most popular packages appearing on the first disc.

  Note to freebsd-stable@                  5 June 2002    6 June 2002    A note should be sent to the freebsd-stable@ to let over-anxious users know that the tags have been created but the release still isn't ready. Tags may be slid before the announcement goes out. Point users to freebsd-qa@ for details.
  Version numbers bumped.                  5 June 2002    8 June 2002    The files listed here are updated to reflect the fact that this is FreeBSD 4.6.
  Update man.cgi on the website.           6 June 2002    3 June 2002    Make sure the 4.6 manual pages are being displayed by default for the man->web gateway. Also make sure these man pages are pointed to by docs.xml.

  Upload to ftp-master.                    10 June 2002   14 June 2002   release and packages uploaded to ftp-master.FreeBSD.org
  Announcement                             10 Jun 2002    15 June 2002   Announcement sent out after a majority of the mirrors have received the bits.
