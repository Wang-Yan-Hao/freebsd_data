Major issues for 7.0-RELEASE

  ------------------------------- -------- --------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Issue                           Status   Responsible                       Description
  routed not working              Done     Robert Watson                     Routed should have been updated because of updates made to the underlying network infrastructure. The old interface was added back in but marked as depreciated.
  TCP accept race condition       Done     Gleb Smirnoff, Robert Watson      A race in TCP will lead to very occasional returning of 0.0.0.0:0 rather than the correct IP address via the socket address returned by accept(). A patch has been merged to HEAD, RELENG_7 and RELENG_7_0.
  sleepq race condition           Done     John Baldwin                      Races in the sleepq implementation will occasionally result in sleeps with timeouts failing to wake up, as well as other symptoms. A patch has been merged to HEAD, RELENG_7, and RELENG_7_0.
  pty race condition              Done     Konstantin Belousov               Multiple race conditions in the tty/pty code have lead to occasional panics. One set of problems has been fixed, but others are still being explored It is aniticipated that the remaining problems will be fixed for 7.0RC2.
  amd64 minidump race condition   Done     Ruslan Ermilov                    A race condition during minidump generation on SMP amd64 could lead trashed file systems due to writing outside of the swap area. A patch has been merged to HEAD, RELENG_7, and RELENG_7_0.
  libkse fork process wedge       Done     Julian Elischer, Daniel Eischen   A bug in libkse could lead the processes hanging after fork if they fork while running multiple threads. A patch has been committed to HEAD that properly reinitializes internal thread library locks after fork; it has been merged to RELENG_7 and RELENG_7_0.
