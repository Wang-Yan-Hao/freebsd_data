  This document lists errata items for FreeBSD 7.0-RELEASE, containing
  significant information discovered after the release or too late in
  the release cycle to be otherwise included in the release
  documentation. This information includes security advisories, as well
  as news relating to the software or documentation that could affect
  its operation or usability. An up-to-date version of this document
  should always be consulted before installing this version of FreeBSD.

  This errata document for FreeBSD 7.0-RELEASE will be maintained until
  the release of FreeBSD 7.1-RELEASE.

1 Introduction

This errata document contains “late-breaking news” about FreeBSD
7.0-RELEASE. Before installing this version, it is important to consult
this document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems
that may already have been found and fixed.

Any version of this errata document actually distributed with the
release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be out of date by
definition, but other copies are kept updated on the Internet and should
be consulted as the “current errata” for this release. These other
copies of the errata are located at http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/,
plus any sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.

Source and binary snapshots of FreeBSD 7-STABLE also contain up-to-date
copies of this document (as of the time of the snapshot).

For a list of all FreeBSD CERT security advisories, see
http://www.FreeBSD.org/security/ or
ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/.

3 Open Issues

[20080229] tcpdump(1) does not correctly print the TX/RX rates for
802.11 frames. This issue has been fixed on the HEAD and RELENG_7
branches.

[20080229] A bug in Linux emulation may cause segmentation faults for
some Linux programs using mmap(2). This issue has been fixed on the HEAD
and RELENG_7 branches.

[20080229] Instances of packet corruption and instability have been
observed with the re(4) network driver. Some users have reported that
using a newer version of this driver (on HEAD) has solved their
problems, or at least mitigated them.

[20080229, updated 20080817] A change in the way that FreeBSD sends TCP
options has been reported to cause connectivity issues. This problem has
been corrected on HEAD and the RELENG_7 and RELENG_7_0 branches..
Further details are contained in errta notice FreeBSD-EN-08:02.tcp.

[20080307] The FreeBSD implementation of SCTP currently depends on
having INET6 support compiled into the kernel. This requirement is
planned to be removed in future releases.

[20080307] Source upgrades from FreeBSD 6.X to FreeBSD 7.0-RELEASE will
generate warnings from kldxref(8) during the installkernel step. These
warnings are harmless and can be ignored.

[20080307] The crypto(4) driver, which is required for IPsec
functionality, has severe problems on FreeBSD/powerpc (a kernel with
device crypto included in its configuration will be non-functional).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

4 Late-Breaking News and Corrections

[20080229] The FreeBSD 7.0-RELEASE release documentation (release notes,
hardware notes, and so forth) all contained a note that users of FreeBSD
7-STABLE should be subscribed to the freebsd-current mailing list. This
note should not have appeared.

[20080229] The release notes gave an incorrect version number for KDE.
The correct version number is 3.5.8.
