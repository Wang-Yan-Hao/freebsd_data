Introduction

This document contains the release notes for FreeBSD 12.0-RELEASE. It
describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of FreeBSD. It
also provides some notes on upgrading from previous versions of FreeBSD.

The release distribution to which these release notes apply represents
the latest point along the 12-STABLE development branch since 12-STABLE
was created. Information regarding pre-built, binary release
distributions along this branch can be found at
https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/.

The release distribution to which these release notes apply represents a
point along the 12-STABLE development branch between 11.2-RELEASE and
the future 13.0-RELEASE. Information regarding pre-built, binary release
distributions along this branch can be found at
https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/.

This distribution of FreeBSD 12.0-RELEASE is a release distribution. It
can be found at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/ or any of its mirrors.
More information on obtaining this (or other) release distributions of
FreeBSD can be found in the Obtaining FreeBSD' appendix to the FreeBSD
Handbook.

All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before installing
FreeBSD. The errata document is updated with "late-breaking" information
discovered late in the release cycle or after the release. Typically, it
contains information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections
to documentation. An up-to-date copy of the errata for FreeBSD
12.0-RELEASE can be found on the FreeBSD Web site.

This document describes the most user-visible new or changed features in
FreeBSD since 11.2-RELEASE. In general, changes described here are
unique to the 12-STABLE branch unless specifically marked as MERGED
features.

Typical release note items document recent security advisories issued
after 11.2-RELEASE, new drivers or hardware support, new commands or
options, major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades. They may
also list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering
practices. Clearly the release notes cannot list every single change
made to FreeBSD between releases; this document focuses primarily on
security advisories, user-visible changes, and major architectural
improvements.

Upgrading from Previous Releases of FreeBSD

[amd64,i386] Binary upgrades between RELEASE versions (and snapshots of
the various security branches) are supported using the freebsd-update(8)
utility. The binary upgrade procedure will update unmodified userland
utilities, as well as unmodified GENERIC kernels distributed as a part
of an official FreeBSD release. The freebsd-update(8) utility requires
that the host being upgraded have Internet connectivity.

Source-based upgrades (those based on recompiling the FreeBSD base
system from source code) from previous versions are supported, according
to the instructions in /usr/src/UPDATING.

functionality replaced by jedec_dimm(4) . [r337033]

The DRM driver for modern graphics chipsets has been marked deprecated
and marked for removal in FreeBSD 13. The DRM kernel modules are
available from graphics/drm-stable-kmod or graphics/drm-legacy-kmod in
the Ports Collection as well as via pkg(8) . Additionally, the kernel
modules have been added to the lua loader.conf(5) module_blacklist, as
installation from the Ports Collection or pkg(8) is strongly
recommended. [r339218]

The following drivers have been deprecated in FreeBSD 12.0, and not
present in FreeBSD 13.0: ae(4) , de(4) , ed(4) , ep(4) , ex(4) , fe(4) ,
pcn(4) , sf(4) , sn(4) , tl(4) , tx(4) , txp(4) , vx(4) , wb(4) , xe(4)
[r339735]

Hardware Support

This section covers general hardware support for physical machines,
hypervisors, and virtualization environments, as well as hardware
changes and updates that do not otherwise fit in other sections of this
document.

Hardware Support

Support for powernv POWER9 MMU initialization has been added. [r333273]

Graphics Support

FreeBSD has changed the way graphics drivers are handled on amd64 and
i386. Graphics drivers for modern ATI/AMD® and Intel® graphics cards are
now available in the Ports Collection. The base drivers are still
available and will be installed by default, but they lack support for
current generation laptop and desktop systems.

In most cases it is enough to install graphics/drm-kmod from ports or
packages to install a driver appropriate for the system, then adding the
appropriate driver to kld_list in rc.conf(5) .

For Intel® (i915) systems after Broadwell™, the rc.conf(5) entry is:

    kld_list="/boot/modules/i915kms.ko"

Systems with ATI/AMD® graphics cards have two options. Modern systems
starting with the HD7000 series GPU should use:

    kld_list="/boot/modules/amdgpu.ko"

Systems with cards released before the HD7000 GPU use:

    kld_list="/boot/modules/radeonkms.ko"

Note:
Users must be added to the video GID after installing graphics/drm-kmod
in order for X to start properly.

Note:
There are known issues with the xserver driver provided by
x11-drivers/xf86-video-ati when using graphics drivers from the base
system; x11-drivers/xf86-video-ati-legacy should be used instead.

Note:
There is a known issue where booting with UEFI and using the ATI/AMD®
graphics driver may cause the screen to be garbled before the
appropriate driver is loaded. For additional information regarding
graphics support on FreeBSD, please see the Graphics Wiki Page.

Virtualization Support

Amazon® EC2™ AMI instances now have sysutils/amazon-ssm-agent installed
by default, though the service is not enabled by default in rc.conf(5) .
To enable the service, add: [r325254]

      >>/etc/rc.conf
        amazon_ssm_agent_enable="YES"

to the EC2™ user-data.

Amazon® EC2™ AMI instances now disable ChallengeResponseAuthentication
in sshd_config(5) by default. [r326564]

Amazon® EC2™ AMI instances now use the Amazon® internal NTP service by
default. [r326565]

The bhyve(8) utility has been updated to allow controlling CPU topology
from userland. [r332298]

The bhyve(8) utility has been updated to add virtio_scsi(4) storage
support. [r334940] (Sponsored by iXsystems)

[r335974] (Sponsored by iXsystems)

A new sysctl(8) , security.jail.vmm_allowed, has been added, which when
set to 1 allows bhyve(8) use within a jail(8) . [r337023] (Sponsored by
HardenedBSD, G2, Inc.)

Amazon® EC2™ AMI instances now disable the PS/2 keyboard and mouse
devices by default, reducing overall boot time by 2.5 seconds. [r338321]

ARM Support

Support for the USB OTG serial terminal has been enabled on arm systems
by default. [r335004] (Sponsored by The FreeBSD Foundation)

The armv6 and armv7 images now default to boot with EFI. [r336998]

Support has been added for building aarch64 images for the PINE64-LTS
system. [r337000]

Support for capsicum(4) has been enabled on armv6 and armv7 by default.
[r338666] (Sponsored by The FreeBSD Foundation)

Storage

This section covers changes and additions to file systems and other
storage subsystems, both local and networked.

General Storage

The UFS/FFS filesystem has been updated to support check hashes to
cylinder-group maps. Support for check hashes is available only for
UFS2. [r323923]

The CAM Target Layer (CTL) frontend and backend options have been
overhauled to use nv(3) allowing creating multiple ioctl(2) frontend
ports. [r333446] (Sponsored by iXsystems)

The default auto_master(5) configuration has been updated to add the
noautoro automont(8) flag to the /media mount point (commented by
default). [r337749] (Sponsored by DARPA, AFRL)

The UFS/FFS filesystem has been updated to consolidate TRIM/BIO_DELETE
commands, reducing read/write requests due to fewer TRIM messages being
sent simultaneously. [r338056] (Sponsored by Netflix)

TRIM consolidation support has been enabled by default in the UFS/FFS
filesystem. TRIM consolidation can be disabled by setting the
vfs.ffs.dotrimcons sysctl(8) to 0, or adding vfs.ffs.dotrimcons=0 to
sysctl.conf(5) . [r338517] (Sponsored by Netflix)

The geom(8) utility has been updated to add a new flag, -p, which prints
the GEOM class of the specified provider. [r338640] (Sponsored by DARPA,
AFRL)

The geom(8) utility has been updated to add a new flag, -t, which prints
the GEOM hierarchy. [r338684] (Sponsored by DARPA, AFRL)

Networked Storage

The NFS version 4.1 server has been updated to include pNFS server
support. [r335012]

ZFS

ZFS has been updated to include new sysctl(8) s,
vfs.zfs.arc_min_prefetch_ms and vfs.zfs.arc_min_prescient_prefetch_ms,
which improve performance of the zpool(8) scrub subcommand. [r334844]

Boot Loader Changes

This section covers the boot loader, boot menu, and other boot-related
