FreeBSD 8.1-RELEASE Release Notes

Release Highlights

The highlights in the 8.1-RELEASE are the following:

-   [powerpc] FreeBSD now supports SMP in PowerPC G5 systems. Note that
    SMP support on FreeBSD/powerpc is disabled by default in GENERIC
    kernel.

-   [sparc64] FreeBSD now supports UltraSPARC IV, IV+, and SPARC64 V
    CPUs.

-   The ZFS zpool version has been updated to 14. The zfsloader has been
    added. This is a separate zfs(8) enabled loader. Note that a ZFS
    bootcode (zfsboot or gptzfsboot) need to be installed to use this
    new loader.

-   The bwn(4) driver for Broadcom BCM43xx chipsets has been added.

-   The run(4) driver for Ralink RT2700U/RT2800U/RT3000U USB 802.11agn
    devices has been added.

-   The sge(4) driver for Silicon Integrated Systems SiS190/191
    Fast/Gigabit Ethernet has been added. This supports TSO and TSO over
    VLAN.

-   The uhso(4) driver for Option HSDPA USB devices has been added. A
    new uhsoctl(1) userland utility can be used to initiate and close
    the WAN connection.

-   The urtw(4) driver has been improved and now supports RTL8187B-based
    devices.

-   The ipfw(4) subsystem including dummynet(4) has been improved.

-   The pfil(9) framework for packet filtering in FreeBSD kernel now
    supports separate packet filtering instances like ipfw(4) for each
    VIMAGE jail.

-   The vlan(4) pseudo interface now supports TSO (TCP Segmentation
    Offloading). The capability flag is named as IFCAP_VLAN_HWTSO and it
    is separated from IFCAP_VLAN_HWTAGGING. The age(4), alc(4), ale(4),
    bce(4), bge(4), cxgb(4), jme(4), re(4), and mxge(4) driver support
    this feature.

-   The vlan(4) pseudo interface for IEEE 802.1Q VLAN now ignore
    renaming of the parent's interface name. The configured VLAN
    interfaces continue to work with the new name while previously the
    configurations were removed as the renaming happens.

-   The HAST (Highly Available STorage) framework has been added. This
    is a framework to allow transparently storing data on two physically
    separated machines connected over the TCP/IP network. HAST works in
    Primary-Secondary (Master-Backup, Master-Slave) configuration, which
    means that only one of the cluster nodes can be active at any given
    time. Only Primary node is able to handle I/O requests to
    HAST-managed devices. Currently HAST is limited to two cluster nodes
    in total.

-   FreeBSD cam(3) SCSI framework has been improved and a new kernel
    option option ATA_CAM has been added. This turns ata(4) controller
    drivers into cam(4) interface modules. When enabled, this option
    deprecates all ata(4) peripheral drivers and interfaces such as ad
    and acd, and allows cam(4) drivers ada, and cd and interfaces to be
    natively used instead. Note that this is not enabled by default in
    the GENERIC kernel.

-   The mvs(4) CAM ATA driver for Marvell 88SX50XX/88SX60XX/88SX70XX/SoC
    SATA controllers has been added. This driver supports same hardware
    as the ata(4) driver does, but provides many additional features,
    such as NCQ and PMP.

-   The liblzma library for LZMA2 lossless data compression algorithm
    and the userland utilities xz(1), xzdec(1), lzma(1), and
    lzmainfo(1). has been imported.

-   The ACPI-CA has been updated to 20100304.

-   ISC BIND has been updated to version 9.6.2-P2.

-   OpenSSH has been updated from version 5.1p1 to version 5.4p1.

-   OpenSSL has been updated to version 0.9.8n.

-   sendmail has been updated to version 8.14.4.

-   The supported version of the GNOME desktop environment (x11/gnome2)
    has been updated to 2.28.2.

-   The supported version of the KDE desktop environment (x11/kde4) has
    been updated to 4.4.3.

For more details, please see the Detailed Release Notes.

A list of all platforms currently under development can be found on the
Supported Platforms page.
