FreeBSD 2.2 Announcement

It is our great pleasure to announce the release of FreeBSD 2.2, the
long-awaited first release of our 2.2 branch technology following
lengthy ALPHA, BETA and GAMMA testing cycles.

FreeBSD 2.2-RELEASE is now available on ftp.FreeBSD.org and various FTP
mirror sites throughout the world. It can also be ordered on CD from
Walnut Creek CDROM, from where it will be shipping shortly.

FreeBSD 2.2 represents a rather large leap in functionality from the
2.1.x releases, everyone being is strongly encouraged to read the
release notes for a list of new features.
