FreeBSD 3.2 Announcement

Date: Mon May 17 19:28:17 PDT 1999
From: "Jordan K. Hubbard" <jkh@freebsd.org>
Subject:FreeBSD 3.2 is released!

It is my usual pleasure to announce the availability of 3.2-RELEASE, our
follow-on to release to FreeBSD 3.1 (released February, 1999). Many bug
fixes and general enhancements have been made to the system and a number
of new features added, so please see the release notes for more
information.

FreeBSD 3.2-RELEASE is available at ftp.freebsd.org and various FTP
mirror sites throughout the world. It can also be ordered on CD from The
FreeBSD Mall, from where it will be shipping soon on a 4 CD set
containing installation bits for both the x86 and Alpha architectures as
well a lot of other material of general interest to programmers and
end-users alike.

NOTE: All of the profits from the sales of this CD set go to support the
FreeBSD Project!

The official FTP distribution site for FreeBSD is:

  ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD
