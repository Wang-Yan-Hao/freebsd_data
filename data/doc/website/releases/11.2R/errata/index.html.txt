FreeBSD 11.2-RELEASE Errata

Abstract

This document lists errata items for FreeBSD 11.2-RELEASE, containing
significant information discovered after the release or too late in the
release cycle to be otherwise included in the release documentation.
This information includes security advisories, as well as news relating
to the software or documentation that could affect its operation or
usability. An up-to-date version of this document should always be
consulted before installing this version of FreeBSD.

This errata document for FreeBSD 11.2-RELEASE will be maintained until
the release of FreeBSD 11.2-RELEASE.

Introduction

This errata document contains "late-breaking news" about FreeBSD
11.2-RELEASE. Before installing this version, it is important to consult
this document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems
that may already have been found and fixed.

Any version of this errata document actually distributed with the
release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be out of date by
definition, but other copies are kept updated on the Internet and should
be consulted as the "current errata" for this release. These other
copies of the errata are located at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/,
plus any sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.

Source and binary snapshots of FreeBSD 11.2-STABLE also contain
up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of the snapshot).

For a list of all FreeBSD CERT security advisories, see
https://www.FreeBSD.org/security/.

Open Issues

-   FreeBSD/i386 installed on ZFS may crash during boot when the ZFS
    pool mount is attempted while booting an unmodified GENERIC kernel.

    A system tunable has been added as of revision r286584 to make the
    kern.kstack_pages tunable configurable without recompiling the
    kernel.

    To mitigate system crashes with such configurations, choose
    Escape to loader prompt in the boot menu and enter the following
    lines from loader(8) prompt, after an OK:

        set kern.kstack_pages=4
        boot

    Add this line to /boot/loader.conf for the change to persist across
    reboots:

        kern.kstack_pages=4

-   [2017-07-25] FreeBSD/arm64 currently lacks EFI real-time clock (RTC)
    support, which may cause the system to boot with the wrong time set.

    As a workaround, either enable ntpdate(8) or include
    ntpd_sync_on_start="YES" in rc.conf(5).

-   [2017-07-25] A late issue was discovered with FreeBSD/arm64 and
    "root on ZFS" installations where the root ZFS pool would fail to be
    located.

    There currently is no workaround.

-   [2017-11-06] An issue with FreeBSD virtual machines with vagrant was
    discovered that affects the VirtualBox where the virtual machine
    will not start on the initial boot invoked with vagrant up.

    The issue is due to the virtual machine MAC being unset, as FreeBSD
    does not provide a default Vagrantfile.

    It has been observed, however, that a subsequent invocation of
    vagrant up will allow the virtual machine to successfully boot,
    allowing access via vagrant ssh.

-   [2018-06-21] An issue had been discovered late in the release cycle
    where removing ZFS vdevs from a pool under certain conditions would
    cause a system crash when zfsd(8) is enabled in rc.conf(5).

    At present, it is believed to be limited to removal of a mirror vdev
    from a pool consisting of multiple mirror vdevs.

    See PR 228750 for more information and updates as the issue is
    investigated.

-   [2018-06-26] An issue had been discovered late in the release cycle
    where a system crash could occur after installing
    emulators/virtualbox-ose-kmod from upstream package mirrors via
    pkg(8).

    Building emulators/virtualbox-ose-kmod from the ports(7) collection
    has been observed to work around the crash.

    See PR 228535 for more information.

-   [2018-06-26] It was discovered after the releng/11.2 branch was
    tagged for FreeBSD 11.2-RELEASE that a few device drivers were
    missing from the hardware page. The missing drivers, alc(4),
    cxgbev(4), liquidio(4), and mos(4) were added to the 11-STABLE
    hardware page.

-   [2018-06-26] The URL to the instructions for source-based upgrades
    in UPDATING incorrectly points to a page that no longer exists. The
    correct URL is
    https://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/makeworld.html.

-   [2018-06-27] The announcement email for FreeBSD 11.2 incorrectly
    states the ocs_fw(4) driver had been added; this should have stated
    ocs_fc(4).

-   [2018-06-28] An issue had been reported after the release of FreeBSD
    11.2 with x11/nvidia-driver installed from the upstream package
    mirrors via pkg(8).

    Building x11/nvidia-driver from the ports(7) collection has been
    reported to resolve the issue.

    See PR 228536 for more information.

-   [2018-10-18] A FreeBSD system with a custom kernel configuration
    excluding NFS on 10.x did not explicitly require the krpc option to
    be included when booting via ZFS-on-root and, for example, setting
    MODULES_OVERRIDE="zfs opensolaris" in the kernel configuration.

    In 11.x, however, krpc is explicitly required if the kernel
    configuration excludes NFS.
