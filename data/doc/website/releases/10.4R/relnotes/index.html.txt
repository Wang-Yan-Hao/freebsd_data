FreeBSD 10.4-RELEASE Release Notes

Abstract

The release notes for FreeBSD 10.4-RELEASE contain a summary of the
changes made to the FreeBSD base system on the 10.4-STABLE development
line. This document lists applicable security advisories that were
issued since the last release, as well as significant changes to the
FreeBSD kernel and userland. Some brief remarks on upgrading are also
presented.

Introduction

This document contains the release notes for FreeBSD 10.4-RELEASE. It
describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of FreeBSD. It
also provides some notes on upgrading from previous versions of FreeBSD.

The snapshot distribution to which these release notes apply represents
a point along the 10.4-STABLE development branch between 10.3-RELEASE
and the future 10.4-STABLE. Information regarding pre-built, binary
snapshot distributions along this branch can be found at
https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/.

All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before installing
FreeBSD. The errata document is updated with "late-breaking" information
discovered late in the release cycle or after the release. Typically, it
contains information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections
to documentation. An up-to-date copy of the errata for FreeBSD
10.3-RELEASE can be found on the FreeBSD Web site.

This document describes the most user-visible new or changed features in
FreeBSD since 10.3-RELEASE.

Typical release note items document recent security advisories issued
after 10.3-RELEASE, new drivers or hardware support, new commands or
options, major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades. They may
also list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering
practices. Clearly the release notes cannot list every single change
made to FreeBSD between releases; this document focuses primarily on
security advisories, user-visible changes, and major architectural
improvements.

Upgrading from Previous Releases of FreeBSD

[amd64,i386] Binary upgrades between RELEASE versions (and snapshots of
the various security branches) are supported using the freebsd-update(8)
utility. The binary upgrade procedure will update unmodified userland
utilities, as well as unmodified GENERIC kernel distributed as a part of
an official FreeBSD release. The freebsd-update(8) utility requires that
the host being upgraded have Internet connectivity.

Source-based upgrades (those based on recompiling the FreeBSD base
system from source code) from previous versions are supported, according
to the instructions in /usr/src/UPDATING.

Important:
Upgrading FreeBSD should only be attempted after backing up all data and
configuration files.

Security and Errata

Userland

This section covers changes and additions to userland applications,
contributed software, and system utilities.

Userland Configuration Changes

The inetd(8) utility is now built without libwrap support when
WITHOUT_TCP_WRAPPERS is set in src.conf(5). (r313206)

The libthr(3) library and related files are now evaluated and removed by
the delete-old-libs target when upgrading the system if WITHOUT_LIBTHR
is set in src.conf(5). (r316046)

The WITH_RPCBIND_WARMSTART_SUPPORT src.conf(5) knob has been added,
which when enabled allows building rpcbind(8) with warmstart support.
(r319243)

Userland Application Changes

The truss(1) utility has been updated to include the -H flag, which logs
the thread ID of a thread invoking a system call. (r298427)

The zfsbootcfg(8) utility has been added, providing one-time
boot.config(5)-style options for zfsboot(8). (r308915)

present. (r316348)

The cxgbetool(8) utility has been added, providing command-line access
to features and debugging facilities of cxgbe(4) devices. (r319390)

The ifconfig(8) utility has been updated to show MAC addresses
persistently stored by network drivers. This provides a mechanism
through which the original MAC address can be retrieved if, for example,
an interface is added to a lagg(4) and the MAC is overridden in
rc.conf(5). (r318430)

The rcp(1), rlogin(1), rsh(1), rlogind(8), and rshd(8) utilities have
been marked as deprecated, and planned for removal in FreeBSD
12.0-RELEASE. (r320646)

The syslogd(8) utility has been updated to restart logging a subprocess
that had restarted unexpectedly. (r320772)

The gdb(1) and kgdb(1) utilities have been marked as deprecated, and
planned for removal from the base system in the future. A newer version
is available in the devel/gdb port. (r320824)

The cron(8) utility has been updated to add support for including files
within /etc/cron.d and /usr/local/etc/cron.d by default. (r321242)

The syslogd(8) utility has been updated to add the include keyword which
allows specifying a directory containing configuration files to be
included in addition to syslog.conf(5). The default syslog.conf(5) has
been updated to include /etc/syslog.d and /usr/local/etc/syslog.d by
default. (r321234)

The newsyslog(8) utility has been updated to support logging to
syslogd(8) in a format compliant with RFC5424. For more details, see the
description for the T flag in newsyslog.conf(5). (r321263)

The pw(8) utility has been updated to support empty secondary groups
being passed with the -G flag, ensuring the target user does not have
any secondary group memberships. (r323333)

Installation and Configuration Tools

The bsdinstall(8) utility has been updated to ensure newly-created
partitions are properly aligned at 4096 byte boundaries. (r313433)

The default EFI partition created by bsdinstall(8) has been increased
from 800KB to 200MB. (r321202) (Sponsored by The FreeBSD Foundation)

Runtime Libraries and API

The kvm_close(3) function has been updated to return the accumulated
error from previous close(2) calls. (r316040)

The syslog(3) function has been updated to be more resilent to thread
cancellation occurring in supported deferred mode, eliminating possible
lockups in multi-threaded applications that often create and cancel
threads using the function, such as net/mpd5. (r320312)

The stdio(3) function has been updated to be deferred cancel-safe,
eliminating possible lockups in multi-threaded applications using
functions such as funopen(3), fropen(3), and fwopen(3). (r321074)

ABI Compatibility

The type max_align_t is now defined for C11 compliance. (r309258)

Userland Debugging

ptrace(2) now supports events for thread creation and destruction,
permitting more reliable debugging of threaded processes. (r304017)

ptrace(2) now supports events for vfork(2), permitting reliable
debugging across vfork(2) invocations. (r304499)

Process core dumps now include the process ID (PID) and command line
arguments. (r306786)

Kernel

This section covers changes to kernel configurations, system tuning, and
system control parameters that are not otherwise categorized.

Miscellaneous Kernel Changes

The vt(4) driver has been updated, increasing the maximum framebuffer
size. (r321198)

Kernel Bug Fixes

(r322793)

System Tuning and Controls

The kern.features.linux and kern.features.linux64 flags have been added
to the kern.features sysctl(8), which when set to 1, indicate the kernel
is configured with compatibility for 32-bit and/or 64-bit linux
binaries, respectively. (r321024)

hypervisors, and virtualization environments, as well as hardware
changes and updates that do not otherwise fit in other sections of this
document.

Virtualization Support

PCI passthrough with bhyve(4) resets functions via FLR when a virtual
machine is started and stopped. (r306520) (Sponsored by Chelsio)
