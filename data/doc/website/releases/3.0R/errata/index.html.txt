FreeBSD 3.0 Errata Notes

    The file
    ERRATA.TXT contains post-release ERRATA for 3.0 and should always
    be considered the definitive place to look *first* before reporting
    a problem with this release.  This file will also be periodically
    updated as new issues are reported so even if you've checked this
    file recently, check it again before filing a bug report.  Any
    changes to this file are also automatically emailed to:

        freebsd-stable@FreeBSD.org

    For 3.0 security advisories, see:

    ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/

    For the latest information.

    ---- Security Advisories:

    Current active security advisories for 3.0:     1

    o SA-98:08: IP fragmentation denial of service

    Fix: Update to 3.0-current or apply patch supplied with advisory 98:08 in:

    ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-98:08.fragment.asc

    ---- System Update Information:


    o The GPL_MATH_EMULATE kernel option causes a fatal trap during system
      startup.

    Fix: Replace the GPL_MATH_EMULATE option with the default math
         emulation option MATH_EMULATE.  This will only affect users who
         have modified their kernel configuration file.  The problem is
         corrected in revision 1.16 of the file
         /usr/src/sys/gnu/i386/fpemul/fpu_entry.c.


    o DOS partition installs fail to find the installation bits.


    Fix: Rename C:\FREEBSD to C:\3.0-RELEASE and retry the installation.
         The naming syntax was changed to make DOS more like the other
         types of installation media but the docs on DOS installation
         were not updated properly to reflect this.  The current sysinstall
         now accepts both locations, as it should have to begin with.
