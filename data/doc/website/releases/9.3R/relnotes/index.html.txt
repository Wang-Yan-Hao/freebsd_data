FreeBSD 9.3-RELEASE Release Notes

Abstract

The release notes for FreeBSD 9.3-RELEASE contain a summary of the
changes made to the FreeBSD base system on the 9.3-STABLE development
line. This document lists applicable security advisories that were
issued since the last release, as well as significant changes to the
FreeBSD kernel and userland. Some brief remarks on upgrading are also
presented.

Introduction

This document contains the release notes for FreeBSD 9.3-RELEASE. It
describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of FreeBSD. It
also provides some notes on upgrading from previous versions of FreeBSD.

This distribution of FreeBSD 9.3-RELEASE is a release distribution. It
can be found at http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/ or any of its mirrors.
More information on obtaining this (or other) release distributions of
FreeBSD can be found in the "Obtaining FreeBSD" appendix to the FreeBSD
Handbook.

All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before installing
FreeBSD. The errata document is updated with "late-breaking" information
discovered late in the release cycle or after the release. Typically, it
contains information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections
to documentation. An up-to-date copy of the errata for FreeBSD
9.3-RELEASE can be found on the FreeBSD Web site.

What’s New

This section describes the most user-visible new or changed features in
FreeBSD since 9.2-RELEASE.

Typical release note items document recent security advisories issued
after 9.2-RELEASE, new drivers or hardware support, new commands or
options, major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades. They may
also list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering
practices. Clearly the release notes cannot list every single change
made to FreeBSD between releases; this document focuses primarily on
security advisories, user-visible changes, and major architectural
improvements.

Security Advisories

Problems described in the following security advisories have been fixed.

several bug fixes and documentation improvements. The openpam_ttyconv(3)
library has been completely rewritten. r263421

parameter to v, even if $1 contains spaces, and local w=~/myfile will
expand the tilde (~). r264423

The find(1) utility has been updated to implement -ignore_readdir_race.
Prior to this change, -ignore_readdir_race existed as an option for GNU
find(1) compatibility, and was ignored if specified. A counter primary,
-noignore_readdir_race now also exists, and is the default behavior.
r264699

The ps(1) utility has been updated to include the -J flag, used to
filter output by matching ail(8) IDs and names. Additionally, argument 0
can be used to -J to only list processes running on the host system.

by default for newsyslog(8). r267114

A new flag, "onifconsole" has been added to /etc/ttys. This allows the
system to provide a login prompt via serial console if the device is an
active kernel console, otherwise it is equivalent to off. r267243

The arc4random(3) library has been updated to match that of
FreeBSD-CURRENT. r267379

been replaced with a stub shell script that instructs to use the
Bugzilla web interface. r267911

Ports and Packages

Important:

Note to FreeBSD desktop users: please read this section carefully,
especially before upgrading ports that depend on Xorg.

In April 2014, the FreeBSD Ports collection switched to a newer version
of Xorg that supports KMS (Kernel Mode Setting).

Users upgrading from earlier versions of FreeBSD 9.x or FreeBSD 8.x
should be aware of several things regarding Xorg:

-   When applications are built from the FreeBSD Ports Collection or
    installed from the new_xorg pkg(8) repository, the newer, KMS-aware
    version of Xorg is used.

-   The KMS version of Xorg does not switch back to text mode after
    leaving the X desktop environment, and the system console will not
    be visible. The new vt(4) console driver supports graphic consoles
    and keeps the console visible after X has exited. The vt(4) driver
    must be compiled into the kernel. A VT kernel configuration example
    file is included in 9.3-RELEASE, but is not compiled or enabled by
    default. See vt(4) and the vt(4) wiki page for additional
    information.

-   Packages for KDE4 are not available in the default (latest) pkg(8)
    repository, however are available in the new_xorg repository. See
    the announcement email for details on how to use the new_xorg
    repository.

    The older Xorg that does not support KMS can still be installed from
    the latest upstream pkg(8) repository and the packages included on
    the 9.3-RELEASE DVD.

    However, it is important to note that some newer applications
    require the newer Xorg, and will not work with the old version. The
    newer [Xorg is recommended, and should be used unless not compatible
    with legacy graphics cards.

    To continue using the old version of Xorg when building from the
    FreeBSD Ports Collection, set WITHOUT_NEW_XORG=yes in make.conf(5).

Release Engineering and Integration

As part of the release build, the etcupdate(8) utility will bootstrap
the system, allowing etcupdate(8) to work after the first upgrade of a
system. r260891

The release.sh script and release Makefile have been updated to use
pkg(7) to populate the dvd installation medium. r262879 (Sponsored by
The FreeBSD Foundation)

The services.mkdb(8) utility has been updated to support multiple byte
orders. Similar to cap_mkdb(1), the services.db will be created with
proper endinanness as part of cross-architecture release builds. r263028

Upgrading from Previous Releases of FreeBSD

Upgrading Using freebsd-update(8) or a Source-Based Procedure

[amd64,i386] Binary upgrades between RELEASE versions (and snapshots of
the various security branches) are supported using the freebsd-update(8)
utility. The binary upgrade procedure will update unmodified userland
utilities, as well as an unmodified GENERIC kernel, distributed as a
part of an official FreeBSD release. The freebsd-update(8) utility
requires that the host being upgraded have Internet connectivity.

Source-based upgrades (those based on recompiling the FreeBSD base
system from source code) from previous versions are supported using to
the instructions in /usr/src/UPDATING.

For more specific information about upgrading instructions, see FreeBSD
9.3-RELEASE Installation Instructions.

Important:

Upgrading FreeBSD should only be attempted after backing up all data and
configuration files.

User-Visible Incompatibilities

FreeBSD 9.0 and later versions have several configuration
incompatibilities with earlier versions of FreeBSD. These differences
are best understood before upgrading. Please read this section and the
Upgrading Section in 9.0-RELEASE Release Notes carefully before
submitting a problem report and/or posting a question to the FreeBSD
mailing lists.
