FreeBSD 11.1-RELEASE Errata

Abstract

This document lists errata items for FreeBSD 11.1-RELEASE, containing
significant information discovered after the release or too late in the
release cycle to be otherwise included in the release documentation.
This information includes security advisories, as well as news relating
to the software or documentation that could affect its operation or
usability. An up-to-date version of this document should always be
consulted before installing this version of FreeBSD.

This errata document for FreeBSD 11.1-RELEASE will be maintained until
the release of FreeBSD 11.1-RELEASE.

Introduction

This errata document contains "late-breaking news" about FreeBSD
11.1-RELEASE Before installing this version, it is important to consult
this document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems
that may already have been found and fixed.

Any version of this errata document actually distributed with the
release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be out of date by
definition, but other copies are kept updated on the Internet and should
be consulted as the "current errata" for this release. These other
copies of the errata are located at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/,
plus any sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.

Source and binary snapshots of FreeBSD 11.1-STABLE also contain
up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of the snapshot).

For a list of all FreeBSD CERT security advisories, see

Note:
This advisory addresses the most significant issues for FreeBSD 11.1 on
amd64 CPUs. We expect to update this advisory to include 10.x for amd64
CPUs. Future FreeBSD releases will address this issue on i386 and other
CPUs.

Open Issues

-   FreeBSD/i386 installed on ZFS may crash during boot when the ZFS
    pool mount is attempted while booting an unmodified GENERIC kernel.

    A system tunable has been added as of revision r286584 to make the
    kern.kstack_pages tunable configurable without recompiling the
    kernel.

    To mitigate system crashes with such configurations, choose
    Escape to loader prompt in the boot menu and enter the following
    lines from loader(8) prompt, after an OK:

        set kern.kstack_pages=4
        boot

    Add this line to /boot/loader.conf for the change to persist across
    reboots:

        kern.kstack_pages=4

-   [2017-07-21] Due to a bug in earlier versions of clang(1) that is
    difficult to work around in the upgrade process, to upgrade the
    system from sources via buildworld to -CURRENT or 11.1-RELEASE, it
    is necessary to upgrade machines running 9.x to at least revision
    r286035, or machines running 10.x to revision r286033. Source-based
    upgrades from 10.3-RELEASE are not affected. This differs from the
    historical situation where one could generally upgrade from anywhere
    on earlier stable branches, so caution should be exercised.

-   [2017-07-25] FreeBSD/arm64 currently lacks EFI real-time clock (RTC)
    support, which may cause the system to boot with the wrong time set.

    As a workaround, either enable ntpdate(8) or include
    ntpd_sync_on_start="YES" in rc.conf(5).

-   [2017-07-25] A late issue was discovered with FreeBSD/arm64 and
    "root on ZFS" installations where the root ZFS pool would fail to be
    located.

    There currently is no workaround.

-   [2017-07-26] Note for those upgrading from 11.1-RC2 in VirtualBox:

    If system panics were experienced when upgrading from 11.1-RC1 to
    11.1-RC2, and the emulators/virtualbox-ose-additions{,-nox11} port
    was built locally as a resolution, the port will either need to be
    rebuilt when upgrading from 11.1-RC2 to 11.1-RELEASE, or reinstall
    the package from the pkg(8) mirrors using either:

         # pkg install -f virtualbox-ose-additions

    or

         # pkg install -f virtualbox-ose-additions-nox11

    To ensure the system does not panic after rebooting into the updated
    kernel, it is recommended to disable the vboxguest service in
    rc.conf(5) prior to rebooting the system if possible, or use pkg(8)
    to forcefully reinstall the package.

    Systems being upgraded from 11.1-RC1 and earlier and 11.1-RC3 to
    11.1-RELEASE should be unaffected.

-   [2017-07-27] The release notes erroneously state revision r315330
    was sponsored by Rubicon Communications, LLC (Netgate), when in fact
    this work was done by Hiroki Mori independently.

-   [2017-08-09] The release notes stated the ruptime(1), rwho(1), and
    rwhod(8) utilities have been marked "deprecated", however this
    change was reversed in 12.0-CURRENT.

    The other utilities mentioned in the entry in the release notes,
    however, are unchanged.

-   [2017-11-06] An issue with FreeBSD virtual machines with vagrant was
    discovered that affects the VirtualBox where the virtual machine
    will not start on the initial boot invoked with vagrant up.

    The issue is due to the virtual machine MAC being unset, as FreeBSD
    does not provide a default Vagrantfile.

    It has been observed, however, that a subsequent invocation of
    vagrant up will allow the virtual machine to successfully boot,
    allowing access via vagrant ssh.
