FreeBSD 5.3 Release Process

Introduction

This is a specific schedule for the release of FreeBSD 5.3. For more
general information about the release engineering process, please see
the Release Engineering section of the web site.

General discussions about the release engineering process or quality
assurance issues should be sent to the public FreeBSD-qa mailing list.
MFC requests should be sent to re@FreeBSD.org.

FreeBSD 5.3 will be the first release from the RELENG_5 branch and thus
will also be the first 5-STABLE release.

The current release engineering TODO list is also available. This list
is updated periodically through the release cycle.

Schedule

  src/ tree frozen                   16 Aug 2004   16 Aug 2004   Announce the src/ code freeze for 5.3. Commits to the HEAD branch will be locked until the RELENG_5 branch is created.
  RELENG_5 branch creation           16 Aug 2004   17 Aug 2004   Create the RELENG_5 branch. Commits to this branch will require Release Engineering approval until the RELENG_5_3 branch is created.

From this time until the tagging of the doc/ tree, non-critical changes should be postponed to allow translation teams time to finish their work for the release. If we can resolve problems before this expected date, doc/ slush could start earlier. At this point, we are considering on 10 Sep at earliest, and on 17 Sep at latest.
