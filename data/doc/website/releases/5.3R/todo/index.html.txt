  Issue                                                                        Status             Responsible                   Description
  Reports of poor performance with the if_re driver (re ethernet interfaces)   In progress        John-Mark Gurney              There have been reports that specific gigabit ethernet cards supported by the if_re driver are experiencing poor performance; a patch has been posted that corrects timer and interrupt problems with the driver, and is believed to correct the performace problems. The patch will be merged to 6.x and 5.x shortly.
  GDB thread support                                                           In progress        David Xu, Marcel Moolenaar    With improved support for threading primitives, support is now required to ease debugging of threaded applications. Ideally, this support will work for both libthr and libkse threading models.
  KSE support for sparc64                                                      In progress        Ken Smith                     Kernel bits implemented, userland not implemented.
  truss support for ptrace                                                     --                 --                            Almost all process debugging tools have been updated to use non-procfs kernel primitives, with the exception of truss(1). As procfs is considered deprecated due to its inherent security risks, it is highly desirable to update truss to operate in a post-procfs world. Dag-Erling Smørgrav had prototype patches; Robert Drehmel is developing and testing patches now. Support for system call tracing has been added to ptrace().
  FAST_IPSEC and KAME compatibility                                            Not done           --                            FAST_IPSEC currently cannot be used directly with the KAME IPv6 implementation, requiring an additional level of IP tunnel indirection to protect IPv6 packets when using hardware crypto acceleration. This issue must be resolved so that the two services may more easily be used together. Among other things, this will require a careful review of the handling of mbuf header copying and m_tag support in the KAME IPv6 code.
  rpc.lockd(8) stability                                                       --                 --                            A process cannot be interrupted while waiting on a lock. Fixing this requires that the RPC code be taught how to deal with lock cancellation and interruption events.
  Revised kld build infrastructure                                             Not done           Peter Wemm                    Kernel modules are currently built independently from a kernel configuration, and independently from one another, resulting in substantially redundant compilation of objects, as well as the inability to easily manage compile-time options for kernel objects (such as MAC, PAE, etc) that may require conditional compilation in the kernel modules. In order to improve build performance and better support options of this sort, the KLD build infrastructure needs to be revamped. Peter Wemm has done some initial prototyping, and should be contacted before starting on this work.
  Race conditions in truss                                                     Errata candidate   Robert Drehmel                Truss appears to contain a race condition during the start-up of debugging, which can result in truss failing to attach to the process before it exits. The symptom is that truss reports that it cannot open the procfs node supporting the process being debugged. A bug also appears to exist where in truss will hang if execve() returns ENOENT. A further race appears to exist in which truss will return "PIOCWAIT: Input/output error" occasionally on startup. The fix for this sufficiently changes process execution handling that we will defer the fix to post-5.0 and consider this errata.
  filedesc LOR                                                                 Not done           --                            The LOR reported in PR kern/55175 needs to be fixed. Filedesc locking needs to be heavily reviewed in general.
  KSE support for alpha                                                        In progress        Marcel Moolenaar              Userland bits implemented, kernel bits not implemented.
  CAM locking                                                                  In progress        Scott Long, Justin T. Gibbs   For kernel API/ABI compatibility reasons, it would be desirable to have the CAM locking strategy determined and loosely implemented for 5.3.
  syscons not working on Sparc64 Ultra-30                                      Not done           --                            When running syscons on an Ultra-30 with Creator-3D typing characters on the keyboard produces garbage. Problem reported by Kris Kennaway. Debugging difficult due to lack of this particular configuration among developers and problem isn't present on similar hardware (e.g. no problem on Ultra-60 w/Creator-3D).

                                                        contains a bit old information. Some parts of this guide
                                                        need a rewrite, and this document should be published as

  Issue                                                                                    Status          Responsible                                         Description
  KSE as the default threads library                                                       Needs testing   David Xu, Daniel Eischen                            KSE has matured to the point of being more stable and POSIX-compliant than the traditional libc_r. All Tier-1 platforms MUST have stable KSE support for 5.3 in order to support a consistent transition. Additionally, all ports that depend on the pthreads API must be modified to properly detect and support the default threading library.
  Updated binutils for all platforms                                                       Needs testing   David O'Brien                                       Binutils needs updating in order to support new platforms, newer GDB versions, and Thread Local Storage.
  gcc 3.3 floating point alignment regression                                              Needs testing                                                       The previous GCC 3.3 snapshot included regressions in alignment of floating point arguments, resulting in a substantial performance degradation. The recent GCC 3.4.2 import should fix this, but more testing is needed.
  in6_pcbnotify() panic with TCP                                                           Done            Robert Watson                                       Jun Kuriyama has reported a failed locking assertion with IPv6 TCP notifications. This problem is believed to be corrected.
  Per-platform Thread-Local Storage                                                        Needs testing   Doug Rabson, Marcel Moolenaar                       To complete support for thread-local storage on FreeBSD, per-architecture changes must be made. Currently pending platforms are amd64, alpha, ia64, i386, sparc64, and powerpc.
  SMP instability under load                                                               Needs testing   Doug White, Alan L. Cox                             High load on SMP systems appears to result in a hard hang related to VM IPI. Doug White has prepared a candidate patch that appears to resolve this instability, which is currently in testing for merge to the CVS HEAD.
  Fine-grained network stack locking without Giant                                         Needs testing   Robert Watson                                       Significant parts of the network stack (especially IPv4, UNIX domain IPC, and sockets) now have fine-grained locking of their data structures. It's possible to run many common network subsystems and services without the Giant lock. However, a number of device drivers and less mainstream network subsystems are currently not MPSAFE. 5.3 betas have shipped with Giant-free networking by default, with some bug reports and fixes in later betas and release candidates. Please report any problems to the current@ mailing list.
  kld support for amd64                                                                    Needs testing   David O'Brien, Ian Dowse                            KLDs work when loaded from userland, but not from the loader. kldxref and loader support has been committed to HEAD and RELENG_5 and needs final testing.
  ATA panics under sparc64                                                                 Needs testing   Søren Schmidt, Scott Long                           Recent changes to the ATA driver trigger a bug on sparc64 that causes a panic on boot. This was caused by bugs in busdma that have been hopefully fixed.
  ifconf() sleep warning                                                                   Done            Brooks Davis                                        The ifconf() ioctl for listing network interfaces performs a copyout() while holding the global ifnet list mutex. This generates a witness warning in the event that copyout() generates a page fault, and risks more serious problems. This problem is believed to be corrected.
  poll()/select() application wedge reports with debug.mpsafenet="1"                       Done            Robert Watson                                       There are reports of applications wedging in poll() and select() while running the network stack without the Giant lock. A recent sleepq change appears to have caused some of the observed problems to go away (others are difficult to test for due to recent SMP instability). This problem appears to be corrected.
  if_em wedging under high pps                                                             Done            Max Laier                                           There have been several reports of if_em cards "wedging" under high packets-per-second load. This problem appears to have been corrected.
  Panic on USB detach                                                                      Needs testing   Warner Losh, Scott Long                             A recent regression in the USB code is causing panics when a USB device detaches, especially USB hubs. A fix is in RELENG_5 now.
  KAME IPSEC "ENOBUFS" problem with racoon and mbuma                                       Done            Robert Watson, Sam Leffler                          There are reports that racoon is unable to complete IKE negotiation due to a send to the pfkey socket returning ENOBUFS. This appears to be a result of an incorrect assumption about mbuf data size due to a change resulting from mbuma. This problem appears to have been corrected.
  BIND9 import into 5-CURRENT                                                              Done            Doug Barton, Dag-Erling Smørgrav, Tom Rhodes        BIND9 is now in RELENG_5 and HEAD. Testing is needed of basic functionality, migration from 8.x, and 3rd party packages in the ports tree.
  Synaptics touchpad problems                                                              Needs testing   Philip Paeps                                        Synaptics updates to the psm(4) driver have resulted in poor interactivity for taps and button press events for some users. Support is now disabled by default but work will procede to fix the underlying problems.
  Scheduler-related hangs involving threads                                                Needs testing   Scott Long, Julian Elischer                         Significant work has happened in the scheduler to fix stability problems. More testing for UP and SMP under heavily load is needed.
  NFS over IPv6 problems                                                                   Done            Doug White                                          Jun Kuriyama has reported problems with NFS over IPv6 not functioning correctly as of the improved NFS support for disconnection changes. Doug White has tracked down the source of the problem (EMSGSIZE being returned by IPv6 UDP send routine due to fragmentation), and is currently exploring possible fixes. This problem appears to have been corrected.
  Reports of socket buffer corruption in tcp_output()                                      Done            Robert Watson                                       There have been reports of occasional corruption of socket buffers. This may have been the result of missing socket buffer locking in tcp_output(), which has now been corrected in 6.x and 5.x; this problem is believed to be fixed.
  Reports of hangs using i4b (isdn4bsd)                                                    Done            Robert Watson                                       There have been reports of system hangs while using ISDN with the i4b ISDN framework on SMP systems. These likely result from insufficient synchronization in the i4b implementation when runnning without the Giant lock over the network stack. The workaround until this is fixed is to re-assert the Giant lock over the stack when i4b is compiled into the kernel; this has been committed to 6.x and and 5.x. This problem appears to have been corrected.
  Problems with multicast and setuid binaries/daemons                                      Done            Robert Watson, Christian S.J. Peron                 There have been reports that multicast socket options on raw sockets no longer work properly with daemons changing privilege or setuid binaries. These symptoms have been tracked down to bugs relating to permitting limited use of raw sockets in jail(). A patch correcting these problems has been merged to 6.x and 5.x. This problem appears to have been corrected.
  Reports of sodealloc() panic under heavy load                                            Done            Robert Watson, Brian F. Feldman                     There have been reports of a so_count invariant violation in sofree(), which may relate to race conditions in sofree() against accept(), which were recently corrected in 6.x, and has been merged to 5.x. This problem appears to have been corrected.
  Merge of Darwin msdosfs, other fixes                                                     Done            --                                                  Apple's Darwin operating system has fairly extensive improvements to msdosfs and other kernel services; these fixes must be reviewed and merged to the FreeBSD tree.
  Reports of poor performance of the if_de driver (de ethernet interfaces)                 Done            Robert Watson, John-Mark Gurney                     There have been reports that if_de ethernet cds behave poorly when running with debug.mpsafenet="1", even though the driver is marked to run all portions with the Giant lock. This suggests a race condition specific to this drive, which is currently being debugged. A patch has been committed to the 6.x and 5.x branches, and appears to correct the problem.
  Threaded application get stuck in an unkillable state when touched by GDB                Done            David Xu                                            Attaching GDB to a threaded process will leave the process in an unkillable state. Rebooting the machine is the only way to recover from this. This is easily triggered when a KDE app crashes and KDE automatically attaches GDB to it to extract a stack trace. A candidate fix is in 6-CURRENT. More testing and review is needed.
  More truss problems                                                                      Done            Alfred Perlstein                                    Truss appears to have another problem. It is repeatable by running "truss -f fsck -p /", suspending it with ^Z, and then killing truss. It will leave behind the fsck processes which will be unkillable.
  Reports of TCP-related instability under extremely high load; possibly related to SACK   Needs testing   George V. Neville-Neil, Robert Watson, Scott Long   There have been reports that, under extremely high load, the tcp_output() routine may appear to run for extended periods, resulting in the appearance of a hang for an extended period (up to 30 minutes), followed by recovery. A fix for SACK was developed and committed that hopefully corrects this problem.
