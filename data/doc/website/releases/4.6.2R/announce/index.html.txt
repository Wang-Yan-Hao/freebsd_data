FreeBSD 4.6.2-RELEASE Announcement

Date: Thu, 15 Aug 2002 14:08:02 -0700
From: "Murray Stokely" <murray@FreeBSD.org>
To: freebsd-announce@FreeBSD.org
Subject: FreeBSD 4.6.2-RELEASE is now available

I am happy to announce the availability of FreeBSD 4.6.2-RELEASE, a
maintenance release of the FreeBSD 4.6-STABLE branch. Since FreeBSD
4.6-RELEASE in June 2002, we have resolved several ATA-related problems,
updated the system OpenSSL and OpenSSH components, and addressed several
security issues.

For a list of new features and known problems, please see the release
notes and errata list, available here:

-   http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/4.6.2R/relnotes.html
-   http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/4.6.2R/errata.html

For more information about FreeBSD release engineering activities
(including information about the upcoming FreeBSD 4.7), please see:

-   http://www.FreeBSD.org/releng/

Availability

FreeBSD 4.6.2-RELEASE supports the i386 and alpha architectures and can
be installed directly over the net using the boot floppies or copied to
a local NFS/FTP server. Distributions for the i386 are available now. As
of this writing, the final builds for the alpha architecture are in
progress and will be made available shortly.

We can't promise that all the mirror sites will carry the larger ISO
images, but they will at least be available from:

-   ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org
-   ftp://ftp.dk.FreeBSD.org
-   ftp://ftp2.FreeBSD.org
-   ftp://ftp.tw.FreeBSD.org
-   ftp://ftp10.tw.FreeBSD.org

If you can't afford FreeBSD on media, are impatient, or just want to use
it for evangelism purposes, then by all means download the ISO images,
otherwise please continue to support the FreeBSD Project by purchasing
media from one of our supporting vendors. The following companies will
be offering FreeBSD 4.6.2 based products:

  ----------------------- --------------------------------------
  Daemon News             http://www.bsdmall.com/freebsd1.html
  FreeBSD Mall, Inc.      http://www.freebsdmall.com/
  FreeBSD Services Ltd.   http://www.freebsd-services.com/
  ----------------------- --------------------------------------

FreeBSD is also available via anonymous FTP from mirror sites in the
following countries: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada,
China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hong
Kong, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Korea, Lithuania, the
Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Saudi
Arabia, South Africa, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan,
Thailand, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom.

Before trying the central FTP site, please check your regional mirror(s)
first by going to:

ftp://ftp.<yourdomain>.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD

Any additional mirror sites will be labeled ftp2, ftp3 and so on.

More information about FreeBSD mirror sites can be found at:

http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/mirrors-ftp.html

For instructions on installing FreeBSD, please see Chapter 2 of The
FreeBSD Handbook. It provides a complete installation walk-through for
users new to FreeBSD, and can be found online at:

http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/install.html

Acknowledgments

bug fixes, features, and suggestions.

Enjoy!
