FreeBSD 5.0 Release Process

Introduction

This is a specific schedule for the release of FreeBSD 5.0. For more
general information about the release engineering process, please see
the Release Engineering section of the web site.

General discussions about the release engineering process or quality
assurance issues should be sent to the public freebsd-qa mailing list.
MFC requests should be sent to re@FreeBSD.org.

One of the major new features of FreeBSD 5.0 will be completely
re-worked SMP support.

The current release engineering TODO list is also available. This list
is updated periodically through the release cycle.
