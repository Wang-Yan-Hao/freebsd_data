  This document lists errata items for FreeBSD 5.4-RELEASE, containing
  significant information discovered after the release or too late in
  the release cycle to be otherwise included in the release
  documentation. This information includes security advisories, as well
  as news relating to the software or documentation that could affect
  its operation or usability. An up-to-date version of this document

1 Introduction

This errata document contains ``late-breaking news'' about FreeBSD
5.4-RELEASE. Before installing this version, it is important to consult
this document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems
that may already have been found and fixed.

Any version of this errata document actually distributed with the
release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be out of date by
definition, but other copies are kept updated on the Internet and should
be consulted as the ``current errata'' for this release. These other
copies of the errata are located at http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/,
plus any sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.

Source and binary snapshots of FreeBSD 5-STABLE also contain up-to-date
copies of this document (as of the time of the snapshot).

3 Open Issues

No issues.

4 Late-Breaking News

(6 May 2005) An error in the default permissions on the /dev/iir device
node, which allowed unprivileged local users to send commands to the
hardware supported by the iir(4) driver. Although the error was fixed
prior to 5.4-RELEASE, it was applied too late in the release cycle to be
mentioned in the release notes. For more information, see security
advisory FreeBSD-SA-05:06.iir.

(6 May 2005) A bug in the validation of i386_get_ldt(2) system call
input arguments, which may allow kernel memory may be disclosed to the
user process, has been fixed. This bug was fixed prior to 5.4-RELEASE,
although not in time to be mentioned in the release notes. For more
information, see security advisory FreeBSD-SA-05:07.ldt.

(6 May 2005) Several information disclosure vulnerabilities in various
parts of the kernel have been fixed in 5.4-RELEASE, although too late to
be mentioned in the release notes. For more information, see security
advisory FreeBSD-SA-05:08.kmem.

(24 Jun 2005) The FreeBSD/sparc64 5.4-RELEASE should have stated that
the FreeBSD/sparc64 GENERIC kernel prior to the upcoming 6.0-RELEASE
officially only supports serial consoles. This is especially true for
the FreeBSD/sparc64 5.4-RELEASE GENERIC kernel because the
ofw_console(4) driver which also provides limited indirect support for
graphical consoles has been replaced with the uart(4) driver in favor
better serial support.

Due to this limitation to serial consoles the screen will stop working
after the message ``jumping to kernel entry at...'' is displayed when
trying to use the FreeBSD/sparc64 5.4-RELEASE GENERIC kernel with a
graphical console, while FreeBSD itself continues working actually.

If you want to use FreeBSD/sparc64 with a graphical console anyway you
can do one of the following:

-   In case your machine is equipped with a Sun Creator, Sun Creator3D,
    or Sun Elite3D frame buffer card and a Sun RS232 keyboard you can
    install FreeBSD/sparc64 5.4-RELEASE with a serial console and
    afterwards compile a custom kernel with the following additional
    options:

        device          sc
        device          creator
        options         KBD_INSTALL_CDEV

    Additionally you have to enable the tty[1-7] entries in /etc/ttys
    like so:

        ttyv0   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  on  secure
        # Virtual terminals
        ttyv1   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  on  secure
        ttyv2   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  on  secure
        ttyv3   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  on  secure
        ttyv4   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  on  secure
        ttyv5   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  on  secure
        ttyv6   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  on  secure
        ttyv7   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         cons25  on  secure

    This will yield native support for these keyboards and frame buffers
    including VTY switching and X Window System. Note that this really
    requires at least FreeBSD/sparc64 5.4-RELEASE otherwise it will not
    work on most of the UltraSPARC models.

-   In case your machine is equipped with a ATI Mach64 frame buffer
    (found on-board in e.g. Sun Blade 100/150 and Sun Ultra 5/10 as well
    as on Sun PGX8 and Sun PGX64 add-on cards) or a PS/2 or a USB
    keyboard update to a FreeBSD/sparc64 6.0 from June 10 2005 or later.
    If you use the stock GENERIC kernel and /etc/ttys from there no
    further action is required.

    This will yield native support for these keyboards and frame buffers
    including VTY switching and X Window System.

-   In case your machine is equipped with hardware other than those
    mentioned above or you refuse to update to FreeBSD/sparc64 6.0 you
    can re-enable the ofw_console(4) driver as a last resort. To do so
    build a custom kernel with the following additional options:

        device          ofw_console
        device          sab
        device          zs

    and make sure to comment out the following kernel option:

        device          uart

    This will yield limited indirect support for any graphical console
    hardware, however with poor performance, and VTY switching as well
    as X Window System do not work with this. Note that ofw_console(4)
    is not really MPSAFE and therefore can result in panics under
    certain conditions.

For more details of how to recompile your kernel or update to FreeBSD
6.0, see Configuring the FreeBSD Kernel and The Cutting Edge sections in
the FreeBSD Handbook, respectively.
