FreeBSD 5.4-RELEASE Announcement

Date: Mon, 9 May 2005 17:01:58 -0400
From: Ken Smith <kensmith@FreeBSD.org>
To: freebsd-announce@FreeBSD.org
Subject: [FreeBSD-Announce] FreeBSD 5.4-RELEASE Announcement

The Release Engineering Team is happy to announce the availability of
FreeBSD 5.4-RELEASE, the latest release of the FreeBSD Stable
development branch. Since FreeBSD 5.3-RELEASE in November 2004 we have
made many improvements in functionality, stability, performance, and
device driver support for some hardware, as well as dealt with known
security issues and made many bugfixes.

For a complete list of new features, known problems, and late-breaking
news, please see the release notes and errata list, available here:

http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/5.4R/relnotes.html

http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/5.4R/errata.html

FreeBSD 5.4 will become an "Errata Branch". In addition to Security
fixes other well-tested fixes to basic functionality will be committed
to the RELENG_5_4 branch after the release. Both Security Advisories and
Errata Notices are announced on the freebsd-announce@freebsd.org mailing
list.

It is expected there will be at least one more release from the RELENG_5
branch, most likely two. The current plans are for the RELENG_6 branch
to be created within the next few months, and an initial 6.0-RELEASE
will be made a few months afterwards. There will be a 5.5-RELEASE
following a few months after the 6.0-RELEASE.

For more information about FreeBSD release engineering activities,
please see:

http://www.FreeBSD.org/releng/

Dedication

The FreeBSD 5.4 Release is dedicated to the memory of Cameron Grant.
Cameron was an active FreeBSD Developer and principal architect of the
sound driver subsystem despite his physical handicap. His is a superb
example of human spirit dominating over adversity. Cameron was an
inspiration to those who met him; he will be fondly remembered and
sorely missed.

Availability

FreeBSD 5.4-RELEASE supports the i386, amd64, ia64, pc98, sparc64, and
alpha architectures and can be installed directly over the net, using
bootable media, or copied to a local NFS/FTP server. Distributions for
all architectures except alpha are available now. The distribution for
alpha should become available within the next day or two.

Please continue to support the FreeBSD Project by purchasing media from
one of our supporting vendors. The following companies will be offering
FreeBSD 5.4 based products:

-   FreeBSD Mall, Inc. http://www.freebsdmall.com/

-   Daemonnews, Inc. http://www.bsdmall.com/freebsd1.html

If you can not afford FreeBSD on media, are impatient, or just want to
use it for evangelism purposes, then by all means download the ISO
images. We can not promise that all the mirror sites will carry the
larger ISO images. At the time of this announcement they are available
from the following sites. MD5 checksums for the release images are
included at the bottom of this message.

Bittorrent

As with the 5.3 release we are experimenting with Bittorrent. A
collection of trackers for the release ISO images is available at

http://people.freebsd.org/~kensmith/5.4-torrent/
