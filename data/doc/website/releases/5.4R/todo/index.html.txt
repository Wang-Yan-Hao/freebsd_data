FreeBSD 5.4 Open Issues

Open Issues

This is the beginning of a list of open issues that need to be worked on
or resolved for FreeBSD 5.4. If you have any updates for this list,
please e-mail re@FreeBSD.org. The feature list for 5.4 is still a work
in progress, so items may be added, removed, or modified before we're
done.

  Issue                                  Status        Responsible              Description
  KAME IPSEC without the Giant Lock      In progress   George V. Neville-Neil   Currently, the KAME IPSEC implementation contains inadequate locking to operate without the Giant lock over the network stack, forcing kernels compiled with the KAME IPSEC implementation (not FAST_IPSEC) to run the network stack with the Giant lock, reducing parallelism, increasing lock contention, and increasing latency by preventing preemption. For 5.4-RELEASE, it is desirable to complete the locking work for KAME IPSEC so that it can run without the Giant lock.
  All Network Interface Drivers MPSAFE   In progress   --                       Currently, some network interface drivers are not safe without the Giant lock due to missing synchronization. These drivers are protected by running non-INTR_MPSAFE and with the IFF_NEEDSGIANT flag set, which cause interrupt threads to acquire the Giant lock before executing the driver's interrupt handler, and to perform if_start (interface transmit start) asynchronously once the Giant lock can be acquired. This results in these drivers performing less well due to increased lock contention, decreased ability to preempt, and latency associated with asynchronous launching of latency-critical events. For 5.4, all network drivers should be able to operate without the Giant lock.
  NetIPX without the Giant Lock          In progress   Robert Watson            Currently, the IPX/SPX (netipx) implementation contains inadequate locking to operate without the Giant lock over the network stack, forcing kernels compiled with IPX support to run the network stack with the Giant lock, reducing parallelism, increasing lock contention, and increasing latency by preventing preemption. For 5.4-RELEASE, it is desirable to complete the locking work for IPX so that it can run without the Giant lock.
  Fix regression in file(1)              --            --                       The new version of file(1) does not cross-build properly. If sparc64 executables are built on i386 the compiled magic numbers file that gets installed is wrong and file(1) doesn't work properly.
  SIGABRT under load                     In progress   Alan L. Cox              Under very high load (Kris sees this on the package builders) a limitation of 16 sumultaneous exec's may be hit in exec_map(). A workaround has been implemented with a fix planned for 5.5.
  DDB_UNATTENDED may not work            Not done      --                       There are reports of problems getting dumps after panics.
  fix for ttywakeup panic                In progress   Doug White               There appears to be a race condition opening/closing ttys.

  Issue                                                       Status   Responsible     Description
  File descriptor locking                                     Done     Jeff Roberson   File descriptor locking needs to be merged back from HEAD.
  IPFilter mpsafe fixes                                       Done     Robert Watson   IPFilter is currently not mpsafe but doesn't run with Giant.
  Update sysinstall to handle separate packages CD            Done     John Baldwin    Avoid the need for a disc1-gnome/disc1-kde as was done for 4.11
  busdma fixes                                                Done     Scott Long      More work is needed on busdma to fix bounce buffer problems.
  AMR driver MPSAFE                                           Done     Scott Long      Making the AMR driver MPSAFE will greatly increase its performance.
  CARP support                                                Done     Gleb Smirnoff   Common Address Redundancy Protocol allows multiple hosts on the same local network to share a set of IP addresses.
  kstack overflows in softupdates                             Done     --              There had been reports of kernel stack overflows in softupdates code that caused filesystem problems on reboot. This was fixed during the early stage of code freeze but should be tested.
  ATAPI CDROMs in PIO mode during install                     Done     Ken Smith       People are having difficulties with various ATAPI CDROMs on various architectures. We need to either do all installs in PIO mode or provide a boot menu method of selecting it.
  truss not working                                           Done     Jeff Roberson   See PR kern/78664.
  Deadlock under heavy interrupt load on MP Opteron systems   Done     Doug White      A deadlock related to delivering IPIs on AMD 64-bit processors has been identified.
  SCHED_ULE update                                            Done     Jeff Roberson   Many improvements have been made to the ULE scheduler in 6-CURRENT. These should be merged back to 5.4. The merging is done but ULE is still known to cause panics for some people, especially on SMP systems. Try it with extreme caution.
