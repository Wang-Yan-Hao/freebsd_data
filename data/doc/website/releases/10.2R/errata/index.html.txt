FreeBSD 10.2-RELEASE Errata

Abstract

This document lists errata items for FreeBSD 10.2-RELEASE, containing
significant information discovered after the release or too late in the
release cycle to be otherwise included in the release documentation.
This information includes security advisories, as well as news relating
to the software or documentation that could affect its operation or
usability. An up-to-date version of this document should always be
consulted before installing this version of FreeBSD.

This errata document for FreeBSD 10.2-RELEASE will be maintained until
the release of FreeBSD 10.3-RELEASE.

Introduction

This errata document contains "late-breaking news" about FreeBSD
10.2-RELEASE Before installing this version, it is important to consult
this document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems
that may already have been found and fixed.

Any version of this errata document actually distributed with the
release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be out of date by
definition, but other copies are kept updated on the Internet and should
be consulted as the "current errata" for this release. These other
copies of the errata are located at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/,
plus any sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.

Source and binary snapshots of FreeBSD 10.2-STABLE also contain
up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of the snapshot).

For a list of all FreeBSD CERT security advisories, see
https://www.FreeBSD.org/security/.

Open Issues

-   FreeBSD/i386 10.2-RELEASE running as a guest operating system on
    VirtualBox# can have a problem with disk I/O access. It depends on
    some specific hardware configuration and does not depend on a
    specific version of VirtualBox or host operating system.

    It has been reported that instability may be present on virtual
    machines running on other hypervisors, such as Xen or KVM.

    It causes various errors and makes FreeBSD quite unstable. Although
    the cause is still unclear, disabling unmapped I/O works as a
    workaround. To disable it, choose Escape to loader prompt in the
    boot menu and enter the following lines from loader(8) prompt, after
    an OK:

        set vfs.unmapped_buf_allowed=0
        boot

    Note that the following line has to be added to /boot/loader.conf
    after a boot. It disables unmapped I/O at every boot:

        vfs.unmapped_buf_allowed=0

-   FreeBSD/i386 10.2-RELEASE installed on ZFS may crash during boot
    when the ZFS pool mount is attempted while booting an unmodified
    GENERIC kernel.

    As described in /usr/src/UPDATING entry 20121223, rebuilding the
    kernel with options KSTACK_PAGES=4 has been observed to resolve the
    boot-time crash. This, however, is not an ideal solution for
    inclusion in the GENERIC kernel configuration, as increasing
    KSTACK_PAGES implicitly decreases available usermode threads in an
    environment that is already resource-starved.

    Taking into account the heavy resource requirements of ZFS, in
    addition to the i386-specific tuning requirements for general
    workloads, using ZFS with the FreeBSD/i386 GENERIC kernel is
    strongly discouraged.

    If installing FreeBSD/i386 on ZFS, it is possible to configure the
    system after installation to increase the KSTACK_PAGES.

    When prompted by bsdinstall(8) to perform additional
    post-installation configuration to the system, select [ YES ].

    This procedure requires the system sources available locally. If the
    System source code distribution was not selected during
    installation, it can be obtained using svnlite:

        # mkdir -p /usr/src
        # svnlite co svn://svn.freebsd.org/base/releng/10.2 /usr/src

    Build the kernel-toolchain required to rebuild the kernel:

        # make -C /usr/src kernel-toolchain

    Next, create a kernel configuration file to increase the
    KSTACK_PAGES option:

        # printf "include GENERIC\noptions KSTACK_PAGES=4\n" > /usr/src/sys/i386/conf/ZFS

    Then build and install the `ZFS` kernel:

        # make -C /usr/src buildkernel KERNCONF=ZFS
        # make -C /usr/src installkernel KERNCONF=ZFS

    Warning:
    It is extremely important to take note that, by default,
    freebsd-update(8) will install the GENERIC kernel configuration, and
    as such, freebsd-update(8) consumers are strongly encouraged to
    avoid FreeBSD-provided kernel binary upgrades with such
    configurations.

-   Due to an incompatibility between bsdconfig(8) and pkg(8), packages
    included on the FreeBSD dvd installer will not be recognized by
    bsdconfig(8).

    To install packages from the dvd1.iso installer, create the /dist
    target directory, and manually mount the dvd1.iso ISO:

        # mkdir -p /dist
        # mount -t cd9660 /dev/cd0 /dist

    Note:
    Be sure to use the correct /dev device path for the dvd1.iso ISO
    installer.

    Next, set REPOS_DIR to the path of the repos/ directory within the
    installer so pkg(8) will use the correct repository metadata.

    If using sh(1):

        # export REPOS_DIR=/dist/packages/repos

    If using csh(1):

        # setenv REPOS_DIR /dist/packages/repos

    Note:
    Keep in mind that REPOS_DIR will need to be set again after the
    current shell session is terminated, if continuing to use the
    packages provided on the dvd1.iso installer.

    Finally, bootstrap pkg(8) from the ISO, and install required
    packages:

        # pkg bootstrap
        # pkg install xorg-server xorg gnome3 [...]

-   An issue was discovered where the netstat(1) -s option will cause a
    segmentation fault on systems with IPSEC compiled into the kernel.
    The issue was resolved in the stable/10 branch, and an Errata Notice
    is planned after 10.2-RELEASE is released.

    [2015-08-19] Resolved as FreeBSD-EN-15:12.

-   An issue was discovered that causes make(1) to generate noisy output
    when doing source-based upgrades from FreeBSD 9.3 and earlier. The
    issue was reported in PR 202277, and after investigation and
    determining the issue does not cause source-based upgrades to fail,
    a post-release Errata Notice is planned.

    [2015-08-19] Resolved as FreeBSD-EN-15:11.

-   An issue with FreeBSD virtual machines with vagrant was discovered
    that affects the VirtualBox where the virtual machine will not start
    on the initial boot invoked with vagrant up.

    The issue is due to the virtual machine MAC being unset, as FreeBSD
    does not provide a default Vagrantfile.

    It has been observed, however, that a subsequent invocation of
    vagrant up will allow the virtual machine to successfully boot,
    allowing access via vagrant ssh.

-   [2015-08-16] An error was discovered in the release notes for
    FreeBSD 10.2-RELEASE regarding the drm device driver. The entry for
    r282199 states the driver was updated to match the version Linux®
    3.8.13 version, however the entry should have noted the change
    affects device-independent code, and does not bring the drm driver
    fully in line with the stated Linux® version.
