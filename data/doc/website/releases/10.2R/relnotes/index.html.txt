Introduction

This document contains the release notes for FreeBSD 10.2-RELEASE. It
describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of FreeBSD. It
also provides some notes on upgrading from previous versions of FreeBSD.

This distribution of FreeBSD 10.2-RELEASE is a release distribution. It
can be found at https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/ or any of its mirrors.
More information on obtaining this (or other) release distributions of
FreeBSD can be found in the Obtaining FreeBSD' appendix to the FreeBSD
Handbook.

All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before installing
FreeBSD. The errata document is updated with "late-breaking" information
discovered late in the release cycle or after the release. Typically, it
contains information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections
to documentation. An up-to-date copy of the errata for FreeBSD
10.2-RELEASE can be found on the FreeBSD Web site.

This document describes the most user-visible new or changed features in
FreeBSD since 10.1-RELEASE.

Typical release note items document recent security advisories issued
after 10.1-RELEASE, new drivers or hardware support, new commands or
options, major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades. They may
also list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering
practices. Clearly the release notes cannot list every single change
made to FreeBSD between releases; this document focuses primarily on
security advisories, user-visible changes, and major architectural
improvements.

Upgrading from Previous Releases of FreeBSD

[amd64,i386] Binary upgrades between RELEASE versions (and snapshots of
the various security branches) are supported using the freebsd-update(8)
utility. The binary upgrade procedure will update unmodified userland
utilities, as well as unmodified GENERIC kernel distributed as a part of
an official FreeBSD release. The freebsd-update(8) utility requires that
the host being upgraded have Internet connectivity.

Source-based upgrades (those based on recompiling the FreeBSD base
system from source code) from previous versions are supported, according
to the instructions in /usr/src/UPDATING.

Important:
Upgrading FreeBSD should only be attempted after backing up all data and
configuration files.

Security and Errata

This section lists the various Security Advisories and Errata Notices
since 10.1-RELEASE.

Userland

This section covers changes and additions to userland applications,
contributed software, and system utilities.

Userland Configuration Changes

The termcap(5) file is installed as-is from sources, instead of
reordering, creating /etc/termcap.db by default, providing a performance
improvements to applications that use the termcap(5) database, such as
vi(1) and ncurses(3). (r276991)

Userland Application Changes

A new utility, dpv(1), has been added to the base system, providing a
dialog(1)-style progress view from one or more input streams. A
corresponding library, dpv(3), has also been added. (r275040)

The elfdump(1) utility has been updated to support capability mode
provided by capsicum(4). (r275945)

The fstyp(8) utility has been added, which is used to determine the
filesystem on a specified device. (r277434) (Sponsored by The FreeBSD
Foundation)

The mkimg(1) utility has been updated to support the MBR EFI partition
type. (r278968) (Sponsored by The FreeBSD Foundation)

A regression in the libarchive(3) library that would prevent a directory
from being included in the archive when --one-file-system is used has
been fixed. (r281044)

The netstat(8) utility has been updated to include a new flag, -R, which
is used to dump RSS/flow information. (r281161) (Sponsored by Limelight
Networks)

The ar(1) utility has been updated to set
ARCHIVE_EXTRACT_SECURE_SYMLINKS and ARCHIVE_EXTRACT_SECURE_NODOTDOT to
disallow directory traversal when extracting an archive, similar to
tar(1). (r281936) (Sponsored by The FreeBSD Foundation)

A race condition in wc(1) that would cause final results to be sent to
stderr(4) when receiving the SIGINFO signal has been fixed. (r282278)

The freebsd-update(8) utility has been updated to prevent fetching
updated binary patches when a previous upgrade has not been thoroughly
completed. (r282870) (Sponsored by ScaleEngine, Inc.)

The uefisign(8) utility has been added. (r282974) (Sponsored by The
FreeBSD Foundation)

The chflags(1), chgrp(1), chmod(1), and chown(8) utilities now affect
symbolic links when the -R flag is specified, as documented in
symlink(7). (r283875) (Sponsored by Multiplay)

The date(1) utility has been updated to print the modification time of
the file passed as an argument to the -r flag, improving compatibility
with the GNU date(1) utility behavior. (r283258)

The mkimg(1) utility has been updated to include a new flag, -c, which
allows specifying the capacity of the target disk image. (r284523)

The pw(8) utility has been updated with a new flag, -R, that sets the
root directory within which the utility will operate. (r285092)

Contributed Software

The resolvconf(8) utility has been updated to version 3.7.0. (r282746)
(Sponsored by The FreeBSD Foundation)

The nc(1) utility has been updated to the OpenBSD 5.7 version. (r283270)

Timezone data files have been updated to version 2015e. (r284398)

The acpi(4) subsystem has been updated to version 20150515. (r284460)

The file(1) utility has been updated to version 5.23. (r284778)

The unbound(8) utility has been updated to version 1.5.3. (r285206)

The sendmail utility has been updated to version 8.15.2. (r285305)

OpenSSL has been updated to version 1.0.1p. (r285330)

The ntp suite has been updated to version 4.2.8p3. (r285612)

compressing sparse files. (r286084)

Installation and Configuration Tools

Support for detecting and implementing a workaround for various laptops
and motherboards that do not boot properly from GPT-partitioned disks
has been added to bsdinstall(8). Additionally, the active flag will be
set on the partition when needed. (r285769) (Sponsored by ScaleEngine,
Inc.)

Support for detecting and implementing aligning partitions on 1Mb
boundaries has been added to bsdinstall(8). (r285721) (Sponsored by
ScaleEngine, Inc.)

Support for selecting the partitioning scheme when installing on the UFS
filesystem has been added to bsdinstall(8). (r285769) (Sponsored by
ScaleEngine, Inc.)

/etc/rc.d Scripts

A new rc(8) script, growfs, has been added, which will resize the root
filesystem on boot if /firstboot exists. (r284009)

/etc/periodic Scripts

A new periodic(8) script, 510.status-world-kernel, has been added, which
evaluates the running userland and kernel versions from the uname(1) -U
and -K arguments, and prints an error if the system userland and kernel
are not in sync. (r277520) (Sponsored by The FreeBSD Foundation)

Runtime Libraries and API

A new file configuration library, figpar(3), has been added to the base
system. (r275040)

The procctl(2) system call has been updated to include a facility for
non init(8) processes to be declared as the reaper of child processes
and their decendants. (r276686) (Sponsored by The FreeBSD Foundation)

failure. (r280392)

ABI Compatibility

The LinuxÂ® compatibility version has been updated to 2.6.18. The
compat.linux.osrelease sysctl(8) is evaluated when building the
emulators/linux-c6 and related ports. (r275807)

Kernel

This section covers changes to kernel configurations, system tuning, and
system control parameters that are not otherwise categorized.

Kernel Bug Fixes

A kernel panic triggered when destroying a vnet(9) jail(8) configured
with gif(4) has been fixed. (r276068)

A kernel panic triggered when destroying a vnet(9) jail(8) configured
with gre(4) has been fixed. (r284018)

Kernel Configuration

The PAE_TABLES kernel configuration option has been added for
FreeBSD/i386, which instructs pmap(9) to use PAE format for page tables
while maintaining a 32-bit physical address size elsewhere in the
kernel. The use of this option can enhance application-level security by
enabling the creation of "no execute" mappings on modern i386
processors. Unlike the PAE option, PAE_TABLES preserves kernel binary
interface (KBI) compatibility with non-PAE kernels, allowing non-PAE
kernel modules and drivers to work with a PAE_TABLES-enabled kernel.
Additionally, system limits are tuned for 4GB maximum RAM, avoiding
kernel virtual address space (KVA) exhaustion. (r282065) (Sponsored by
The FreeBSD Foundation)

The SIFTR kernel configuration has been added, allowing building
siftr(4) statically into the kernel. (r282826)

[amd64,i386] The nvd(4) and nvme(4) drivers are now included in the
GENERIC kernel configuration by default. (r283076) (Sponsored by Intel
Corporation)

A new kernel configuration option, EM_MULTIQUEUE, has been added which
enables multi-queue support in the em(4) driver. (r284522) (Sponsored by
Limelight Networks)

Note:
Multi-queue support in the em(4) driver is not officially supported by
IntelÂ®.

System Tuning and Controls

Throttling via ACPI and P4TCC via device.hints(5) have been turned off
by default. (r276986)

The hwpmc(4) default and maximum callchain depths have been increased.
The default has been increased from 16 to 32, and the maximum increased
from 32 to 128. (r278982) (Sponsored by The FreeBSD Foundation)

The devfs(5) device filesystem has been changed to update timestamps for
read/write operations using seconds precision. A new sysctl(8),
vfs.devfs.dotimes has been added, which when set to a non-zero value,
enables default precision timestamps for these operations. (r281255)
(Sponsored by iXsystems, The FreeBSD Foundation)

The kern.osrelease and kern.osreldate are now configurable jail(8)
parameters. (r280632)

A new sysctl(8), kern.racct.enable, has been added, which when set to a
non-zero value allows using rctl(8) with the GENERIC kernel. A new
kernel configuration option, RACCT_DISABLED has also been added.
(r284665) (Sponsored by The FreeBSD Foundation)

The GENERIC kernel configuration now includes RACCT and RCTL by default.
(r284665) (Sponsored by The FreeBSD Foundation)

Note:
To enable RACCT and RCTL on a system using the GENERIC kernel
configuration, add kern.racct.enable=1 to loader.conf(5), and reboot the
system.
