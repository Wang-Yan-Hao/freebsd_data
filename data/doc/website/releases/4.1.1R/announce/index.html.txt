FreeBSD 4.1.1 Announcement

Date: Wed, 27 Sep 2000 00:07:50 -070
From: "Jordan K. Hubbard" <jkh@zippy.osd.bsdi.com>
To: announce@FreeBSD.org
Subject: 4.1.1-RELEASE now available from ftp.freebsd.org

As always, I’m pleased to announce the availability of FreeBSD
4.1.1-RELEASE, a point release update for 4.1-RELEASE and, of course,
the very latest in 4.x-STABLE branch technology.

Since 4.1-RELEASE was produced in August 2000, RSA released their code
into the public domain and a number of other security enhancements were
made possible through the FreeBSD project’s permission to export
cryptographic code from the United States. These changes are fully
reflected in 4.1.1-RELEASE, making it one of the most secure "out of the
box" releases of FreeBSD we’ve ever done.

We also took the opportunity to include support for new features like
IDE ATA100 support, drivers for additional Gigabit ethernet cards and
hardware watchpoints in gdb. Please see the release notes for more
information.

The 4.1.1-RELEASE is available right now for the i386 architecture
(alpha to follow in several days) in "FTP installable" and ISO image
form. For the appropriate bits, please see:

ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/4.1.1-RELEASE/
ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/ISO-IMAGES/4.1.1-install.iso

When the Alpha release follows in several days, it will be available
from:

ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/alpha/4.1.1-RELEASE/
ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/alpha/ISO-IMAGES/4.1.1-install.iso

Please watch the alpha@freebsd.org mailing list for an announcement.

IMPORTANT NOTE: This is a network only point release and will not be
made generally available for sale on CDROM, at least not from BSDi or
anyone else we currently have knowledge of. The next official CD release
will be FreeBSD 4.2-RELEASE, still scheduled for mid-November 2000.

FreeBSD is also available via anonymous FTP from mirror sites in the
following countries: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, the
Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong,
Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Korea, Latvia, Malaysia, the
Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Rumania, Russia, Slovenia, South Africa,
Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand, Elbonia, the Ukraine and the United
Kingdom (and quite possibly several others which I’ve never even heard
of :).

Before trying the central FTP site, please check your regional mirror(s)
first by going to:

      ftp://ftp.<yourdomain>.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD

Any additional mirror sites will be labeled ftp2, ftp3 and so on.

Thanks! - Jordan
