FreeBSD 4.1.1 Errata Notes

    If you read no other documentation before installing this
    version of FreeBSD, you should at least by all means *READ
    THE ERRATA* for this release so that you don't stumble over
    problems which have already been found and fixed.  This ERRATA.TXT
    file is obviously already out of date by definition, but other
    copies are kept updated on the net and should be consulted as
    the "current errata" for your release.  These other copies of
    the errata are located at:

      1. http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/

      2. ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/<your-release>/ERRATA.TXT
         (and any sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location).

    Any changes to this file are also automatically emailed to:

        freebsd-current@FreeBSD.org

    For all FreeBSD security advisories, see:

        http://www.FreeBSD.org/security/

    for the latest security incident information.
