FreeBSD 3.4 Errata Notes

    If you read no other documentation before installing this
    version of FreeBSD, you should at least by all means *READ
    THE ERRATA* for this release so that you don't stumble over
    problems which have already been found and fixed.  This ERRATA.TXT
    file is obviously already out of date by definition, but other
    copies are kept updated on the net and should be consulted as
    the "current errata" for your release.  These other copies of
    the errata are located at:

      1. http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/

      2. ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/<your-release>/ERRATA.TXT
         (and any sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location).

    Any changes to this file are also automatically emailed to:

            freebsd-stable@FreeBSD.org

    For all CERT security advisories, see:

            ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/

    For the latest security incident information.

    ---- Security Advisories:

    Current active security advisories for 3.4:

        FreeBSD-SA-00:01.make

    ---- System Update Information:

    As shipped, the "Custom" installation option in 3.4 is broken
    and menu items like Configure don't work

    Fix: Both the "Novice" and "Express" install paths still work and
         can be used just as effectively (if not succinctly).  Alternately,
         you can invoke the custom installation from the "Index" menu
         (Installation, Custom) along with the Configuration option.  You
         can also just download a fixed mfsroot.flp floppy image (or boot.flp
         if you need 2.88MB boot media) from the following URL:

      ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/3.4-RELEASE/floppies/updates/

         The 3.4 ISO installation image is also updated to contain fixes
         for all these errata items.

    802.1Q VLAN support compilation error: kernel configurations
    containing "pseudo-device vlan #" fail to compile

    Fix: Update your copy of sys/net/if_vlan.c to the 3-stable branch
         version, where it is fixed, or apply the following patch to the
         sys/net/if_vlan.c distributed with 3.4-RELEASE:

    RCS file: /home/ncvs/src/sys/net/if_vlan.c,v
    retrieving revision 1.4.2.2
    retrieving revision 1.4.2.3
    diff -C2 -r1.4.2.2 -r1.4.2.3
    *** if_vlan.c   1999/12/13 02:02:23 1.4.2.2
    --- if_vlan.c   1999/12/25 03:28:51 1.4.2.3
    ***************
    *** 515,519 ****
                ifv->ifv_p = 0;
                if_down(ifp);
    !           ifv->if_flags &= ~(IFF_UP|IFF_RUNNING);
                break;
            }
    --- 515,519 ----
                ifv->ifv_p = 0;
                if_down(ifp);
    !           ifp->if_flags &= ~(IFF_UP|IFF_RUNNING);
                break;
            }
