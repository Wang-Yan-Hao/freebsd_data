FreeBSD 2.2.8 Errata Notes

    The file
    ERRATA.TXT contains post-release ERRATA for 2.2.8 and should always
    be considered the definitive place to look *first* before reporting
    a problem with this release.  This file will also be periodically
    updated as new issues are reported so even if you've checked this
    file recently, check it again before filing a bug report.  Any
    changes to this file are also automatically emailed to:

        freebsd-stable@FreeBSD.org

    For 2.2.8 security advisories, see:

    ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/

    For the latest information.

    ---- Security Advisories:

    Current active security advisories for 2.2.8:   None

    ---- System Update Information:

    o /usr/sbin/sysctl is an invalid link and whereis(1) doesn't work.

    Fix: sysctl(8) has actually moved to /sbin/sysctl.  Simply create
         a symbolic link for compatability purposes as follows:

            ln -sf /sbin/sysctl /usr/sbin

         or syncronize your sources with 2.2-stable and rebuild/install
         from /usr/src/usr.bin/whereis/ and just rm /usr/sbin/sysctl

    o    /usr/share/doc/FAQ is in spanish.

    Fix: This was a build failure which affected only the FAQ and has since
         been fixed.  If you are already cvsup/CTM'ing the doc-all tag then
         you can simply remake and install the FAQ from sources, otherwise
         grab ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/doc/FAQ.tar.gz and unpack
         as follows:  tar --unlink -xvzf FAQ.tar.gz -C /usr/share/doc
         to get an english FAQ.

    o    getpwnam(3) semantics are incorrect in some cases.

    Fix: If passed a string longer than the maximum allowed for a user name,
         getpwnam will incorrectly return an entry for a user that matches the
         initial characters in the string up to the maximum length allowed for a
         user name.  To correct this behaviour, libc needs to be patched and
         recompiled.  The appropriate patch can be obtained from:
         http://cvsweb.FreeBSD.org/src/lib/libc/gen/getpwent.c.diff?r1="1".35.2.2&r2="1".35.2.3
