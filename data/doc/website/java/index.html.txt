FreeBSD Java® Project

[Jump to Java®]

Getting Java

There are two choices of Java Development Kits on FreeBSD:

OpenJDK

The OpenJDK® project provides a native open-source implementation of the
Java® SE Platform. It is available for all currently supported FreeBSD
releases in the following combinations of versions (by architecture):

aarch64: openjdk8, openjdk11, openjdk12, openjdk13

amd64: openjdk7, openjdk8, openjdk11, openjdk12, openjdk13

arm6: openjdk8

arm7: openjdk8

i386: openjdk7, openjdk8, openjdk11, openjdk12, openjdk13

powerpc: openjdk8

powerpc64: openjdk8, openjdk11, openjdk12, openjdk13

OpenJDK® is frequently updated, and it is suggested to refer to revision
logs for detailed release history. Additionally, one may choose to
review more information at FreshPorts.

To install OpenJDK® package use the pkg(7) utility or the ports system:

pkg install openjdk[version]

or

cd /usr/ports/java/openjdk[version]

make install clean

where [version] is one of 7, 8, 11, 12, or 13. An example (openjdk11):

pkg install openjdk11

or

cd /usr/ports/java/openjdk11

make install clean

Oracle JDK for Linux

This port installs the Java Development Kit from Oracle which was built
for Linux. It will run under FreeBSD using the Linux compatibility.

pkg install linux-oracle-jdk18

or

cd /usr/ports/java/linux-oracle-jdk18

make install clean

Note: Please note that due to the current licensing policy the Oracle
JDK on FreeBSD binaries can not be distributed and you are only
permitted to use them personally. For the same reason, the sources must
be fetched manually.

-   Creating Ports

I want to help by…​

…​ fixing bugs or adding new features

The main repositories for the BSD port of OpenJDK are publically
available on Github. Pull requests are welcome. You can find more
information on this Wiki

…​ testing

The best thing you can do is download the latest release, install it,
and try all your favorite Java applications. If they don’t work, see
below.

…​ reporting a bug

If you find an application that does not work, or crashes, here are the
steps you should follow before reporting it:

1.  Try it again.

2.  Check your settings for this application. Check to see if you made a
    mistake in starting it up.

3.  Try it on a different platform. If you have access to a reference
    platform, try it there. (We need to determine if it is an
    application error, a Java bug, or a FreeBSD specific bug.)

4.  Narrow down the problem. If it is your own code, narrow down the bug
    to the offending code. Otherwise, determine the steps required to
    reproduce the problem.

5.  Notify the JDK porting team. Send email to freebsd-java@FreeBSD.org.
    Be sure to include the steps you have followed.

6.  Finally, and most importantly, be willing to work with the team to
    fix the problem.

…​writing documentation

Everyone can help here. If you have a suggestion to add to the
documentation, write it up and send it to freebsd-java@FreeBSD.org
