|             | before merging their product line with that of Walnut  |
|             | Creek CDROM. PHT now also produces the FreeBSD/J       |
|             | (Japanese) CD product.                                 |
+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| ##[CD       | This is the cover disc from the Korean magazine. Note  |
| cover]      | the creative cover art! The CD contains the FreeBSD    |
|             | 2.2.1 release with some local additions.               |
+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| [CD cover]  | This is it - the very first FreeBSD CD published! Both |
|             | the FreeBSD Project and Walnut Creek CDROM were fairly |
|             | young back then, and you’ll probably have little       |
|             | difficulty in spotting the differences in production   |
|             | quality between then and now.                          |
+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| [CD cover]  | This was the second FreeBSD CD published by Walnut     |
|             | Creek CDROM and also the very last on the 1.x branch   |
|             | (ref USL/Novell lawsuit and settlement). The next      |
|             | release, FreeBSD 1.1.5, was only available on the net. |
+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| [CD cover]  | This unusual CD is something of a collector’s item now |
|             | given that almost all existing examples were           |
|             | systematically tracked down and destroyed. An artwork  |
|             | mishap has this CD dated for the wrong year, and on    |
|             | the spine "January" is also misspelled as "Jaunary",   |
|             | just to increase the embarrassment factor. Ah, the     |
|             | perils of turning in one’s artwork just hours before   |
|             | leaving for a trade show.                              |
+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| [CD cover]  | This is the fixed-up version of the FreeBSD 2.0 CD.    |
|             | Note that the color scheme has even been changed in    |
|             | the corrected version, something unusual for a fixup   |
|             | and perhaps done to distance it from the earlier       |
|             | mistake.                                               |
+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| [CD cover]  | The FreeBSD 2.0.5 release CD. This was the first CD to |
|             | feature Tatsumi Hosokawa’s daemon artwork.             |
+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| [CD cover]  | The FreeBSD 2.1 release CD. This was the first CD      |
|             | release on the 2.1 branch (the last being 2.1.7).      |
+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| [CD cover]  | The FreeBSD 2.1.5 release CD.                          |

| [CD cover]  | The FreeBSD 2.1.6 release CD.                          |
+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| [CD cover]  | The Japanese version of 2.1.6. This was the first and  |
|             | last Japanese localized version published by WC,       |
|             | responsibility for that product then transitioning to  |
|             | a team led by Tatsumi Hosokawa and sponsored by        |
|             | Pacific Hitech and Laser5.                             |
+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| [CD cover]  | The FreeBSD 2.1.7 release CD. Also the last CD         |
|             | released on the 2.1.x branch. Done primarily as a      |
|             | security fixup for 2.1.6                               |
+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| [CD cover]  | An early release SNAPshot of 2.2 (done before 2.2.1    |
|             | was released).                                         |
+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| [CD cover]  | The FreeBSD 2.2.1 release CD. This was the first CD on |
|             | the 2.2 branch.                                        |

+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| [CD cover]  | The FreeBSD mailing list and newsgroup archives,       |
|             | turned into HTML and semi-indexed by thread. This      |
|             | product ran for 2 releases and then stopped with a     |
|             | thud once it became obvious that there was simply too  |
|             | much data to deal with on one CD. Perhaps when DVD     |
|             | becomes more popular…​                                  |
