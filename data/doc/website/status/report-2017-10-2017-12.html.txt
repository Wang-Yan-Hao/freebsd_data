The last quarter of 2017 ended with over 27,000 ports in the repository.
There are currently just under 2,800 open ports PRs with 685 of them
unassigned. There were 6,700 commits made by 178 committers. The
statistics did not change much since last quarter, however the number of
unassigned PRs dropped slightly.

This quarter, we welcomed Yuri Victorovich (yuri@), Jason Bacon (jwb@),
and Wolfram Scheider (wosch@) as new or returning port committers. No
commit bits were taken in for safekeeping.

Portmgr, together with postmaster@, changed the policy of the
FreeBSD-ports@ mailing list. It is now required to be subscribed to the
list before one can post to it. This will help in reducing spam on this
list and help users finding better questions to their answers while
browsing the list archive.

This quarter ports "flavors" went live. Flavors can be used to build
multiple variations of a port, for example py27-sarge and py36-sarge.
All Python ports and some other ports are now flavored. Other uses of
flavors could be including or excluding X11 (foo vs foo-x11 or
foo-nox11) or selecting the printer paper size (A4 vs letter).

USES=fmake has been removed as it was no longer useful.

Some default versions got updated: Ruby to 2.4 and Samba to 4.6. Firefox
got updated to version 57.0.3 and pkg to 1.10.3.

During the last quarter, antoine@ ran 33 exp-runs to validate changes to
the base system, fix Qt5 ports, test Python flavors and other port
updates, and make rubygem port builds reproducible.

Open tasks:

1.  Clang 6 is being imported into base. There is a PR that keeps track
    of ports failing with this compiler, see PR 224669. If you use any
    ports mentioned here, please consider fixing them.

The FreeBSD Core Team

Contact: FreeBSD Core Team <core@FreeBSD.org>

The most significant action by Core during the final quarter of 2017 was
the approval of the new Code of Conduct after a long period of
development and review. Core added a preamble to the text emphasizing
the principles behind the Code of Conduct over detailed interpretation
of the rules. The new code delegates the handling of complaints to a
Code of Conduct review board; we are currently finalizing practical
arrangements around setting up the review board before announcing the
adoption of the new code.

John Hixson of iXsystems was proposed, and accepted, as the first new
Project Member under the new rules adopted earlier this year. Core feels
that John is an excellent choice as the first member, and looks forwards
to adding many other project members in the future.

There have been some significant changes around the Security Officer and
secteam. Gordon Tetlow has formally taken over the role of Security
Officer from Xin Li. Xin remains an active member of secteam, and Ed
Maste has now joined secteam as well.

Gordon joined Secteam at a point where they were struggling with
handling the widely publicised WPA2 vulnerability
(FreeBSD-SA-17:07.wpa), and had an immediate impact simply by making a
public response, even though the technical fixes were not entirely
ready. Gordon's remit from Core is to examine how Secteam operates and
work out how to manage their case-load while avoiding the problems of
burn-out and overload that have impeded Secteam's effectiveness in the
past.

One of the key problems is that security problems are handled in a
completely separate bug handling system to general PRs. This is unusual
compared to most similar OS projects, and leads to difficulties in
bringing in available talent from amongst the entire body of FreeBSD
developers in order to be able to share the load and react quickly.
Secteam is working with Bugmeister to enable suitable access controls
within our main Bugzilla instance, so that we can both conform to bug
embargoes and other confidentiality requirements but also make it easy
to solicit fixes from a wider range of developers and to transition
security bugs to open handling like any other bug once there is no more
need for secrecy.

This quarter also saw the creation of a 10.4-RELEASE branch, and the
extension of the lifetime of 11.0-RELEASE by one month. The former was
in response to requests from a number of prominent FreeBSD consumers,
who needed access to new functionality but could not immediately upgrade
to 11.0-RELEASE. Releasing 10.4 permitted this without making a
significant extension to the lifetime of the 10.x release series.

The extension to 11.0-RELEASE EoL was a consequence of failing to
communicate the impending switch to 11.1-RELEASE in good time. Since
this was the first minor version transition under the new release
schedule, in discussion with Secteam and Release Engineering, we
concluded that a delay was necessary to allow the userbase sufficient
warning to upgrade before 11.0-RELEASE went out of support. This was not
a cost-free decision: as Portmgr reminded us, this affected package
building and delayed implementation of some important updates.

FreeBSD will be participating in Google Summer of Code again in 2018.
This has become one of our most important routes for recruiting the new,
young developers vital for ensuring the longevity of the project.

Pedro Giffuni proposed adopting the SPDX license tagging system as used
by many other projects, including the Linux kernel, in order to
facilitate programatic license management by downstream consumers. Core
agreed enthusiasticly.

Core has agreed to promote the MIPS architecture to Tier-2 status.

A proposal to enhance security by discontinuing HTTP or other
unencrypted channels for all FreeBSD services was not something Core
could approve for the immediate future. While switching to HTTPS has
obvious security benefits, we would need to distribute appropriate CA
certificates as part of the base system and make certain other changes
before this could be achieved relatively seamlessly. All FreeBSD
services are already available over secure channels, but our
documentation did not necessarily present secure access methods as the
preferred routes. Action is being taken to address the documentation,
and this question will be revisited once the necessary groundwork is in
place.

The fortune(6) program has long been a focus for controversy, and
previous Cores have needed to impose a lock on updates to the fortune
data files. The argument blew up again over the re-deletion of a number
of apparently pro-Nazi quotations. Core decided that enough was enough
and removed all of the fortune data files except for FreeBSD-tips.dat
from the base system. The tacit approval of many questionable or
controversial opinions by shipping them as a part of the base system is
a liability the project simply cannot afford.

No new commit bits were issued during this quarter, but we did see two
former committers: Sean Eric Fagan and Wolfram Schneider, reactivate
their commit bits. One committer, Ngie Cooper, has handed back their
bit.

RDMA stack update based on Linux v4.9

  ------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------

  Subversion Commit Adding the Driver   URL: https://svnweb.FreeBSD.org/base?view=revision&revision=326169
  ------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------

Contact: Mellanox Drivers Team <FreeBSD-drivers@mellanox.com>

An update to the FreeBSD RDMA stack based on code from Linux v4.9 was
merged into FreeBSD 12-CURRENT on November 4th, including many bug fixes
and new features with a focus on RoCEv2 — Routable RoCE.

RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) is a network protocol that leverages
Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) capabilities to accelerate
communications between applications hosted on clusters of servers and
storage arrays. RoCE incorporates the IBTA RDMA semantics to allow
devices to perform direct memory to memory transfers at the application
level without involving the host CPU. Both the transport processing and
the memory translation and placement are performed by hardware resulting
in lower latency, higher throughput, and better performance compared to
software based protocols.

RoCEv2 is the most recent version of RoCE, adding some routing
capabilities as both IP and UDP headers are included in the packet
format. To complete the RoCEv2 solution, Support for ECN (Explicit
Congestion Notification, lossy fabric) and PFC (Priority Flow Control,
lossless fabric) protocols with rate limiting options will be added in
the first quarter of 2018.

This project also introduces the following updates:

-   libibverbs, librdmacm, libibumad and vendor-specific libraries
    ported from the Linux rdma-core v15+
-   InfiniBand diagnostic tools, infiniband-diags, version 1.6.7
-   InfiniBand subnet manager — OpenSM, version 3.3.20+
-   LinuxKPI support

Important notes:

-   GPL-only (non dual-licensed) portions of the Linux code were either
    excluded or written from scratch under a BSD license by Hans Petter
    Selasky.
-   The code has been tested by several RDMA vendors that also support
    iWARP.

This project was sponsored by Mellanox Technologies.

Open tasks:

1.  Add ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification) and PFC (Priority Flow
    Control) support.

Semihalf is happy to announce that FreeBSD is running on an IBM Power8
processor. This project is a continuation of work done by Nathan
Whitehorn, who provided a basic support for a PowerNV emulator.

The IBM Power8 family of CPUs offers superior performance compared to
previous CPUs in the Power series. It provides complete NUMA support
with up to 128 execution threads in two-socket system (2 sockets, 8
cores per socket, 8 threads per core). All I/O communication is handled
by an integrated PCIe interface equipped with multiple IOMMU engines.

The support for Power8 system running FreeBSD in a non-virtualized
environment contains:

-   A generic driver for the OPAL hypervisor
-   kboot loader modifications to allow for a little-endian to load a
    big-endian kernel ELF image
-   An update to the ELF parser in skiboot, allowing it to understand
    the FreeBSD kernel file format
-   Basic support for the PowerNV architecture, including modes of
    operation, memory-management unit (MMU), and interrupt controller
-   SMP operation with up to 128 CPUs
-   PCI host bridge subsystem driver, including IOMMU mapping for
    external busses
-   PCIe host controller driver
-   USB-3.0 XHCI driver
-   Reworked several drivers to be big-endian compatible
-   Chelsio cxgbe(4) 10/25G network adapter
-   NVMe SSD driver

All work is available in the linked GitHub repository. The process of
getting this work into the official repository has already started and
eventually, all commits will be integrated into FreeBSD-12 CURRENT.

This project was sponsored by IBM, The FreeBSD Foundation, QCM
Technologies, Semihalf, and Limelight Networks (Kevin Bowling).

  LibreNMS ZFS Addition   URL: https://github.com/librenms/librenms/pull/7938
  ----------------------- -----------------------------------------------------

Contact: Zane Bowers-Hadley <vvelox@vvelox.net>

LibreNMS is an autodiscovering PHP/MySQL/SNMP-based network monitoring
solution which includes support for a wide range of network hardware and
operating systems, including Cisco, Linux, FreeBSD, Juniper, Brocade,
Foundry, HP and many more.

Among other things, it can monitor applications and other functionality
running on a server via SNMP extensions. This has been the area of focus
for my present work.

ZFS support has been committed towards the end of December, which was
too late to make the December release, but it will be in the January
release.

This brings the ability to monitor ARC and pool information, with each
pool having its own separate set of graphs.

The ARC graphing is as below.

-   ARC size in bytes
-   ARC size, percent of max size
-   ARC size breakdown
-   ARC efficiency
-   ARC cache hits by list
-   ARC cache hits by type
-   ARC cache misses by type
-   ARC cache hits
-   ARC cache misses
-   ARC misc (deleted, skips, and recycle misses)

The pool tracking is comparatively much simpler, using the output from
zpool list.

-   Pool Space
-   Pool Capacity
-   Pool Fragmentation

Open tasks:

1.  Suggestions are needed for additional statistics or other
    information to monitor, whether FreeBSD-specific or otherwise.
