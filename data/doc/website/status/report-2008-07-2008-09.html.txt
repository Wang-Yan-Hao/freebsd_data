Introduction

In this Quarter work has been progressing in quite a few areas of
FreeBSD. FreeBSD 7.1-BETA2 and 6.4-RC2 have been released for
pre-release testing. EuroBSDCon 2008 took place in Strasbourg, France
and quite a few developers got together for the Developer Summit before
the Conference. The USB2 stack has been imported into the -HEAD branch.

Thanks to all the reporters for the excellent work! We hope you enjoy
reading.

CVSMode for csup

  --------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Links                 
  Perforce repository   URL: http://p4web.freebsd.org/@md=d&cd=//&po=h&c=gCY@//depot/user/lulf/csup/?ac=83
  --------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contact: Ulf Lilleengen <lulf@FreeBSD.org>

The implementation of cvsmode for csup has become more mature, and has
been tested by a few people so far. All parts directly related to
CVSMode have been implemented, and it seems to work quite well. Testers
are still needed, so any users of cvsup using it to mirror or fetch the
CVS repository (cvsmode/mirror mode) are encouraged to try it.

Open tasks:

1.  Implement support for the rsync protocol (not needed for proper
    working, but it will probably speed up csup in some cases)
2.  Implement complete support for using the status file in cvsmode

------------------------------------------------------------------------

FreeBSD for ASUS EeePC

  --------------- --------------------------------------
  Links           
  ASUS Eee Wiki   URL: http://wiki.freebsd.org/AsusEee
  --------------- --------------------------------------

Contact: Stanislav Sedov <stas@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Rui Paulo <rpaulo@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Lars Engels <lme@FreeBSD.org>

ASUS Eee is a line of cheap subnotebooks. These come with Linux or
Windows preinstalled. The hardware is a bit inconventional, so it
required some efforts to make FreeBSD run properly on this hardware.
Also, these machines contain some hardware that was not supported by
FreeBSD.

Currently FreeBSD should run on all Eee models out of the box, and most
hardware should just work. At least, 700, 701, 901 and 1000 was tested
successfully. The hardware supported includes Atheros wireless backed by
ath(4) in HEAD (you still need a patch for RELENG_7), Attansic L2
FastEthernet controller (ae(4)), High Definition audio controller
(snd_hda), Synaptics touchpad and so on. Suspend/resume also works fine
with some exceptions.

There is also a hardware monitoring module, that allows user to control
FAN speed and voltage, as well as monitor current CPU temperature. Wiki
page contains information on how to obtain this module and use it. There
are also a lot of useful tips and tricks for using FreeBSD on ASUS EeePC
on that page.

Open tasks:

1.  Attansic L1 Gigabit Ethernet support (for ASUS Eee 901)
2.  Wireless driver for ASUS Eee 901 (ral(4))
3.  Fix Synaptics resume path.

pkg_trans

          URL: http://wiki.freebsd.org/IvanVoras/PkgTransProposal
  ------- ---------------------------------------------------------

Contact: Ivan Voras <ivoras@freebsd.org>

The "pkg_trans" project is a work in progress aiming to add package
transactions / grouping to common package manipulation utilities
(pkg_add, pkg_delete). The intention is to have all packages pulled in
by a particular command like "pkg_add" or "make install" grouped in a
single transaction, which can be later rolled back. This will allow
users to, for example, install a big tree of dependent packages (like
kde4), try it, and later delete it.

Currently the pkg_trans and the patched utilities are available for
testing. There are some open issues but it's generally stable.

Open tasks:

1.  I cannot modify the "make install" infrastructure for ports and 3rd
    party utilities such as portupgrade. People who know these utilities
    are very welcome to help.
2.  More testing is needed.

For the first time we sent out a request for project proposals. We were
very excited about the proposals we received. We accepted four projects
and will be announcing them soon. We were proud to sponsor NYCBSDCon and
EuroBSDCon. We are also a sponsor of MeetBSDCon. We provided travel
grants for the Cambridge FreeBSD Developer Summit in August. We are
continuing to provide updated Java binaries for FreeBSD 7.0. We
continued to provide legal support for the project.

The new USB stack has been imported to FreeBSD-CURRENT. There is an
ongoing review process at the freebsd-usb mailing list and the
freebsd-current mailing list. A couple of minor issues remain.

Release Engineering Team

Contact: Ken Smith <re@FreeBSD.org>

The Release Engineering Team continues to work on getting 6.4-RELEASE
and 7.1-RELEASE ready. 6.4-RC2 builds are coming up shortly, with
6.4-RELEASE expected about two weeks later. There are still a few issues
being worked on for 7.1-RELEASE though hopefully we will be ready to
proceed with 7.1-RC1 within the next week. Both 6.4-RELEASE and
7.1-RELEASE will include DVD image ISOs for the amd64 and i386
architectures which has been requested by quite a few end-users.

Contact: Bjoern A. Zeeb <bz@FreeBSD.ORG>

The multi-IPv4/v6/no-IP jails project was resumed beginning of this year
and is in the final stage now. A commit is imminent waiting for final
review to be finished.

As an alternative solution to full network stack virtualization, this
work shall provide a lightweight solution for multi-IP virtualization.
The changes are even more important because of the emerging demand for
IPv6.

Ideally this will be merged to FreeBSD 7 before 7.2-RELEASE and stay in
FreeBSD 8 for the transitional period to full network stack
virtualization.

Open tasks:

1.  Finish review.
2.  Management (rc framework, ..) for 7-STABLE.
3.  Identify ports that need to be updated.

Synaptics touchpads support improvements in psm(4)

  ------- ------------------------------------------------
  Links   
          URL: http://wiki.freebsd.org/SynapticsTouchpad
  ------- ------------------------------------------------

Contact: Jean-SÃ©bastien PÃ©dron <dumbbell@FreeBSD.org>

psm(4) provides basic support for Synaptics Touchpad but doesn't allow
one to take advantage of many features like multi-finger tap and
tap-hold, or virtual scrolling. A driver for X.Org is available but the
movements are not very precise and the setup is not easy if you want to
use your touchpad in the console.

The goal of this project is to first provide a better movement filtering
and smoothing, then bring the more advanced features.

Right now, movement filtering, multi-finger tap, tap-hold and virtual
scrolling (using a dedicated area) is implemented.

Virtual scrolling with two fingers (as seen on Apple MacBook) will be
brought back soon.

But before that, the new driver needs testing! It's currently tested on
an ASUS V6V only and feedback on other laptops would be greatly
appreciated.

Open tasks:

1.  Test and send feedback.

In July, pgj gave a presentation (in Hungarian) about the FreeBSD
Hungarian Documentation Project in Debrecen, Hungary.

Based on the checkupdate script mentioned in our previous status report,
we launched our Translation Checking Service to help to schedule
periodic updates for Hungarian doc/www translations. Moreover, a small
bug in EPS images blocking automatic generation of the Handbook PDF
version was corrected , therefore it is now available for download .

Shortly after the renovation of its source, translation of the FAQ has
also become part of Hungarian documentations. Both online and offline
versions are available. A recently translated article (
gjournal-desktop) has also been added.

Hungarian translation of the FreeBSD Documentation Project Primer for
New Contributors has been started . We hope this will encourage others
to help our work. There is always place in our team, every submitted
translation or feedback is appreciated and very welcome.

Open tasks:

1.  Translate release notes for -CURRENT and 7.X
2.  Translate articles
3.  Translate the FDP Primer
4.  Read the translations, send feedback

  ----------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------

Contact: Edwin Groothuis <edwin@FreeBSD.org>

There are many FreeBSD mirrors, either FTP or WWW or CVSup or RSync, but
are they really all up-to-date? Some are, some aren't. The ones who
aren't, how out to date are they? Or do they only carry a subset of the
data? And how does it go over time?

This project checks once per day the contents of the sites which are
advertised in DNS, with the rsync*, www*, cvsup* and ftp* prefixes. The
lists of hosts are based on the contents of the DNS zonefile for the
country domains, so it will be automatically adjusted whenever a mirror
is added.

The statuses can be compared on country base and between two dates and
the 10 day score overview shows the general health of the FreeBSD
Mirroring network.

Open tasks:

1.  Create a list of contact details per mirror.
2.  Chase mirror maintainers with regarding to the status of their
    servers.

Earlier this year I put efforts into the creation of a new layout for
the FreeBSD mailinglists. The following issues were tackled:

-   Display which mailinglists are active and are visited often.
-   A clean weekly/monthly overview per list.
-   In the weekly/monthly overview, be able to go forward and backward
    in time.
-   Browsing through threads goes by the Replies/Replies To/Referenced
    By/References To fields of the emails, but visible who the email is
    from.
-   An overview of the thread with quick links to the articles.
-   Text attachments are normally shown, other attachment are normally
    not shown.
-   Tag messages, see your browsing history, reply to emails and an
    "wrap long lines" feature.
-   Filtering out of svn-, cvs-, freebsd-, and p4- groups.
-   Show date and time in the format you want.
-   Storing of preferences managed via OpenID identification.

The mailinglist website is updated once per hour with the mailinglists
via cvsup.

Open tasks:

1.  Addition of RSS feeds per mailinglist and for the "last day"
    feature.
