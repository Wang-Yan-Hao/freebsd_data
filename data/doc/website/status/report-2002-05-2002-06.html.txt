Introduction

May and June were remarkably busy months for the FreeBSD Project--
FreeBSD developers met in Monterey, CA in June for FreeBSD Developer
Summit III to discuss strategy for the FreeBSD 5.0 release later this
year, for the USENIX Annual Technical conference and for the FreeBSD
BoF. Substantial technical progress was made on FreeBSD 5.0, and FreeBSD
4.6-RELEASE was cut on the RELENG_4 branch in June.

The remainder of the summer will continue to be busy. Final components
and features for 5.0-RELEASE will go into the tree, and the development
direction will change from new features to stability, performance, and
production-readiness. With additional 5.0 development previews late in
the summer, we hope to broaden the tester base for the -CURRENT branch,
and start to get early adopters digging out any potential problems in
their test environments. I encourage both FreeBSD Developers and FreeBSD
Users to give 5.0-DP2 a spin (on a machine without critical data!) and
let us know how it goes. The more testing that happens before the
release, the less fixing we have to do afterwards!

Not much to report. Another engineering snapshot is available for
download at
http://www.geocities.com/m_evmenkin/ngbt-fbsd-20020709.tar.gz. If anyone
has Bluetooth hardware and spare time please join in and help me with
testing.

This snapshot includes basic support for USB devices and manual pages.
The HCI layer now has support for multiple control hooks. All HCI
transport drivers (H4, BT3C and UBT) has been changed to provide
consistent interface to the rest of the world. Some userspace utilities
have been changed as well.

Still no support for RFCOMM (Serial port emulation over Bluetooth link)
and SDP (Service Discovery Protocol). Several design flaws have been
discovered and it might take some time to resolve these issues.

Fast IPSEC Status

Contact: Sam Leffler <sam@FreeBSD.org>

The main goal of this project is to modify the IPSEC protocols to use
the kernel-level crypto subsystem imported from OpenBSD (see elsewhere).
A secondary goal is to do general performance tuning of the IPSEC
protocols.

Basic functionality is operational for IPv4 protocols. IPv6 support is
coded but not yet tested. Hardware assisted cryptographic operations are
working with good performance improvements. Operation with
software-based cryptographic calculations appears to be at least as good
as the existing implementation. Numerous opportunities for performance
improvements have been identified.

This work is currently being done in the -stable tree. A port to the
-current tree is about to start.

Since the last status report, the following utilities have been brought
up to conformance (at least to some degree) with POSIX.1-2001, they
include: asa(1), cd(1), compress(1), ctags(1), ls(1), newgrp(1),
nice(1), od(1), pathchk(1), renice(1), tabs(1), tr(1), uniq(1), wc(1),
and who(1). In addition, development is taking place on bringing the BSD
SCCS suite up to date with newer standards.

On the API front, printf(9) has been given support for the `j' and 'n'
flags, waitpid(2) now supports the WCONTINUED option, and an
implementation of fstatvfs() and statvfs() has been committed. An
implementation of utmpx is in progress, which has an aim to address some
of the major problems with the current utmp. Several headers have been
brought up to conformance with POSIX.1-2001, they include:
<netinet/in.h>, <pwd.h>, <sys/statvfs.h>, and <sys/wait.h>.

Things are going well with the FreeBSD GNOME Project. We have just
finished porting the GNOME 2.0 Final development platform and desktop to
FreeBSD! We hope to be able to make GNOME 2.0 the default for 5.0-DP2
and 4.7-RELEASE. In the meantime, we're working to port more GNOME 2.0
applications.

In order to allow GNOME 1.4.1 applications to work with GNOME 2.0, we
are revamping the GNOME porting infrastructure. GNOME 1.4.1 based ports
are being converted to use the new GNOMENG porting structure. The
specifics of this new system will be written up in the GNOME porting
guide found on the FreeBSD GNOME project homepage.

The BSD Java Porting Team has been making slow but steady progress on a
number of fronts in the last few months. Unfortunately most of this has
occurred behind the scenes, meaning this is a good opportunity to bring
the community up to date.

-   Bill Huey has gotten the Java HotSpot Virtual Machine up and running
    on FreeBSD! While dubbing the code of alpha quality, Bill has been
    working hard and is able to run major examples such as the Java 2D
    demo. This code has hit the repository and will soon be available.
-   The port of the 1.4 J2SDK has commenced. The first commits have gone
    into the tree, although a first patchset is a way off yet.
-   Progress continues with the TCK compliance testing. The current
    status has the JDK down to 19 compiler failures and 183 runtime
    failures. As we edge closer to compliance its hoped that example
    code will be released to allow the community to pull together
    through the final few bugs.
-   A new patchset for JDK 1.3.1 is imminent. This patchset will include
    HotSpot for the first time.

Over the past few months the FreeBSD Release Engineering Team oversaw a
release process that culminated in the release of FreeBSD 4.6 for the
i386 and Alpha architectures on June 15. The RE team is currently
working concurrently on FreeBSD 4.6.1 and 5.0 DP2. 4.6.1 is a minor
point release with an updated SSH and BIND, fixes for some of the
reported ata(4) problems, and assorted security enhancements that will
be detailed in the release notes. The release engineering activities for
4.6.1 are taking place on the RELENG_4_6 branch in CVS, while the work
on 5.0 DP2 is taking place in Perforce so as not to disturb ongoing
-CURRENT development. We are still committed to FreeBSD 5.0 on or around
November 15, 2002. For more information about upcoming release
schedules, please see our website above. The RE team would like to thank
Sentex Communications for providing the release builders with access to
a fast i386 build machine. Compaq also donated a couple of fast Alpha
build machines to the project.

Contact: Jacques Vidrine <nectar@FreeBSD.org>

After an outstanding job serving the project as Security Officer for
over a year, Kris stepped down in January in order to focus more of his
time pursuing his PhD. I offered to attempt to fill the vacant role.

This is the first report by the SO Team. Notable events since the
beginning of 2002 follow.

28 FreeBSD Security Advisories have been issued, 16 of which were
regarding the base system. Of those sixteen, 8 affected only FreeBSD.

FreeBSD Security Notices were introduced, and four have been issued so
far. The Security Notices cover issues that are not regarded as critical
enough to warrant a Security Advisory. So far only Ports Collection
issues (i.e. vulnerabilities in optional 3rd party packages) have been
reported in Security Notices. The first four Security Notices covered 53
individual issues.

Issues reported to the SO team are now being tracked using a
RequestTracker ticket database.

The SO team has undergone membership changes, as well as some changes in
internal organization. The membership and organization has also been
made publicly visible on the FreeBSD Security Officer web page.

IA64 has been progressing slowly. We have access to a prototype 4-way
Itaninum2 system from Intel and have managed to get it up and running to
the point of being able to access disk and network with SMP enabled. We
have a big problem with ACPI2.0 and PCI routing table entries behind
pci-pci bridges with no short-term solution in sight. Various WIP items
have been committed to CVS, namely more complete support for executing
32bit i386 binaries as well as Marcel Moolenaar's prototype EFI GPT
tools.

Hardware Crypto Support Status

Contact: Sam Leffler <sam@FreeBSD.org>

The goal of this project is to import the OpenBSD kernel-level crypto
subsystem. This facility provides kernel- and user-level access to
hardware crypto devices for the calculation of cryptographic hashes,
ciphers, and public key operations. The main clients of this facility
are the kernel RNG (/dev/random), network protocols (e.g. IPSEC), and
OpenSSL (through the /dev/crypto device).

The software has been available as a patch against the -stable tree for
about six months. The core crypto support is tested, including device
drivers for the Hifn 7951, and Broadcom 5805, 5820, and 5821 parts.
Recent work has concentrated on fixing device driver bugs, fixing
support for Hifn 7811 parts, adding support for public key operations,
and adding flow-control between the crypto layer and device drivers.
Future work includes porting this facility to the -current tree.

IP Routing Table Replacement

Contact: Andre Oppermann <oppermann@pipeline.ch>
Contact: Claudio Jeker <jeker@n-r-g.com>

The current Patricia Trie routing table in BSD UNIX is not very
efficient and wastes an enormous amount of space for every node (more
than 256 bytes) (A full Internet view of 110k routes takes 33 MByte of
KVM). Another problem are pointers from and to everywhere in the routing
table. This makes replacing the table very hard and also significantly
increases the table maintenance burden (for example for some kinds of
updates the entire PCB has to be searched linearly). Also this is a
heavy burden for SMP locking. The rewrite focuses on untangling the
pointer mess, making the routing table replaceable and providing a more
IP optimized table (5 MByte for 110k routes). Other new options include
policy routing and some structural alignments in the network stack for
clarity, simplicity and flexibility.

The rewritten IP routing table will be ready for committing in October.

Contact: Luigi Rizzo <luigi@FreeBSD.org>

In summer 2002 the native FreeBSD firewall has been completely rewritten
in a form that uses BPF-like instructions to perform packet matching in
a more effective way. The external user interface is completely backward
compatible, though you can make use of some newer match patterns (e.g.
to handle sparse sets of IP addresses) which can dramatically simplify
the writing of ruleset (and speed up their processing). The new
firewall, called ipfw2, is much faster and easier to extend than the old
one. It has been already included in FreeBSD-CURRENT, and patches for
FreeBSD-STABLE are available from the author.

I spent busy days in last two months, many new topics are emerged from
the project. We now support FreeBSD/alpha 5-current distribution by
cross-compiling on the x86 PC. Anonymous ftp area is now exported to the
yet another web server. Our release branch snapshots are relocated to
daemon.jp.FreeBSD.org because of our CPU/network bandwidth problem.

I'm seriously considering to solve the lack of CPU and network resources
for the project's future evolution. Maybe the bandwidth problem can be
resolved (several bandwidth offers have been received!), but there is no
answer about CPU problems (I have a plan to upgrade our PCs from
P3-500MHz to P4 or better). If you have interested in donating PCs to
the project, please email me for more detail.

I'm afraid KAME Project does not work actively with regard to FreeBSD in
these two month, since we are too busy with the demonstration of our
IPv6 implementation at Networld+Interop 2002 Tokyo. (Thanks to a great
effort, the demonstration was quite successful)

We are aware of netinet6-related bug reports regarding socket handling,
fine-grain locking, ip6fw etc. Regret to say, we could not answer them
right now due to the above situation, however we'll discus these issues
internally and determine what to do.

The project took a major step at the beginning of July when
Milestone-III was committed. Milestone-III allows a simple test program
(available at /usr/src/tools/KSE/ksetest/) to run multiple threads,
using kernel support. It does not yet allow the ability to allow these
threads to run on different CPUs simultaneously. Milestone IV will be to
allow this, however Milestone-III should allow Dan to start (with any
interested parties) to start prototyping the userland part of the
system. Milestone-III is only currently usable on x86, and does not
include some of the requirements for full thread-control, suspension
etc. that will be required later.

Before M-IV is started some small tweaking is likely in the central
sources on M-III as we discover issues as we try to get the userland
jumpstarted. These will have no effect on non-KSE processes, (i.e. all
of them :-) and should not be an issue for other developers.

A tex/fig->html guru is needed to help maintain the KSE web page (not
mentioned above as it is broken).

Max has been busy cleaning up the user interface dark side, and has come
up with a plan to improve the build system (using an automated Makefile
dependency generator); the UI design and the TCL glue magic (using
Swig). A development page has been created on usw4, publishing a lot of
information about the current project status, a Changelog, screenshots,
documentation, etc. A new listbox widget has been implemented, making
diskeditor look nicer and more usable. The package system backend is
being inspected and redesigned to conform to a standard that is itself
being re-thought. Indeed, the old sysinstall2.txt text has been
SGML-ized and enhanced and now provides a good (although rough) overview
of libh package system. This allowed the document to be enhanced with
diagrams of how different procedures work. We are therefore getting
closer to a real pkgAPI specification document. The package management
tools have been slightly enhanced and should be a bit more usable, and
we started committing regression test suites in the tree, mostly to test
and maintain pkg API conformance.

So work continues on libh. I plan to take a look at the rhtvision port
to see if it would be better to use it for the tvision backend. I'll
keep on working on the package system to make it really trustworthy,
while Max is continuing his great work on the UI subsystem. I hope to
make a new libh alpha release soon. Note that from now on, libh progress
will be published on the development page.

  ------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contact: Bosko Milekic <bmilekic@FreeBSD.org>

The lightweight interrupt scheduling code makes scheduling an interrupt
on i386 without having to grab the sched_lock possible, and also avoids
a full-blown context switch.

Currently, the code in the p4 branch works, although needs a little bit
of cleanup and, most importantly, requires a merge to post-KSE III. Now
that stuff seems to have stabilized a bit, I'm waiting to get a little
time (and nerve) to do the merge. Also, looking forward for some KSE
interface that will allow for "KSE borrowing," which would make this
cleaner with regards to KSE and lightweight interrupts. This is a 5.0
feature.

Contact: Jeffrey Hsu <hsu@FreeBSD.org>

Jennifer Yang's patch was committed June 10 for the BSD Summit. After a
few bugs which were reported initially and fixed that same week,
networking in -current has been stable, including the parts that were
not locked up, like IPv6. Work is on-going to lock up the rest of the
stack.

  Some [Old] mb_alloc stuff   URL: http://people.FreeBSD.org/~bmilekic/code/mb_alloc/
  --------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------

Contact: Bosko Milekic <bmilekic@FreeBSD.org>

mb_alloc is getting some updates and a couple of optimizations. A new
allocator interface routine should already be committed by the time this
report is "published:" m_getcl() allocates an mbuf and a cluster in one
shot. This is the result of months (literally) of requests from Alfred
and, recently, Luigi - who, coincidentally, is the author of the same
[upcoming] routine in -STABLE.

Other than that, mb_alloc is being shown how to perform multi-mbuf or
cluster allocations without dropping the cache lock in between
(m_getcl() and m_getm() will use this). Finally, work is being done to
optimize ext_buf ref. count allocations and to provide support for jumbo
(> 9K) clusters.

NATD rewrite

Contact: Claudio Jeker <jeker@n-r-g.com>
Contact: Andre Oppermann <oppermann@pipeline.ch>

The current natd is pretty powerful in translating different kinds of
traffic but not very powerful in configuration. This project rewrites
natd and parts of libalias to give it a configuration set as powerful
and expressive as the ones in ipf (ipnat) and pf. In addition it'll use
kqueue and will support aliasing to multiple IP addresses.

The rewritten natd will be ready for committing in early September.

NEWCARD

Contact: Warner Losh <imp@FreeBSD.org>

A devd daemon, to replace pccardd and usbd, has been designed. A few
minor bugs have been fixed in NEWCARD. NEWCARD is now the default in
-current. There is an experimental pci/cardbus bus code merge available
as a branch which will be merged into current as soon as it is stable.

Status: The ed driver, for non-ne2000 clones, is broken and won't probe.
The ata driver won't attach. The sio driver hangs on the first
character. The wi driver is known to work well. Cardbus cards are
generally known to work well, except for some de based cards, which
unfortunately includes the popular Xircom cards. Many systems fail to
work because acpi fails to route interrupts correctly for non-root pci
bridges.

OLDCARD

Contact: Warner Losh <imp@FreeBSD.org>

A major power bug was fixed in oldcard. This caused many problems for
people using PCI interrupts having their machines hang on boot. This fix
has made it into 4.6.1.

Cardbus power is now used on all cardbus bridges that support it. This
means that we now support 3.3V cards on all cardbus bridges. Before, we
only supported them on some of the bridges because every bridge uses
different 3.3V power control when programmed through the ExCA registers.
Now that we're going through the CardBus bridge's power control
register, 3.3V cards work. In fact, for CardBus bridges, the so called
X.XV and Y.YV cards will work in those bridges that support them.
However, X.XV and Y.YV haven't been defined yet, and no bridges support
them (but the bridge interface define it). Obviously this latter part is
untested.

CL-PD6722 support has been augmented slightly. Now it is possible to
instruct the driver which type of 3.3V card detection strategy to use.
There are three choices: none, do it like the CL-PD6710 does it and do
it like the CL-PD6722 does it.

Preliminary support for the CL-PD6729 on a PCI card using PCI interrupts
has been committed. However, it fails for at least one of the cards like
this the author has.

Client drivers can now ask for the manufacturer and model number of the
card without parsing the CIS directly.

Except for fixing bugs and updating pccard.conf entries, no additional
work is planned on the OLDCARD system.

The port of openoffice 1.0 has been finished. Most showstopper issues
with rtld, libc and our toolchain have been fixed. There is one
remaining deadlock in the web-browser code of OO.org. If anybody like to
help us with fixing this bug (may be another libc_r bug as it looks
like) just mail me! Unfortunately gcc2 support got broken again with the
import of gcc2.95.4 in STABLE. Exceptions support seems to be broken
again; we get internal compiler errors with c++ exceptions code. You'll
have to use gcc31 again.

Since our package cluster is outdated and can not build OO.org packages
anytime soon, I did my own little package cluster and can now offer
packages for 4.6R for 16 different languages. They can be found on the
project homepage.

Porting of OpenOffice1.0.1 is on it's way. A beta port and a package
have been made available on the project homepage.

SMPng Status Report

Contact: John Baldwin <jhb@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: <smp@FreeBSD.org>

The SMPng project has continued to make steady progress in the past two
months. Jeff Roberson completed the switch over to UMA for the general
kernel malloc() and free() pushing down Giant appropriately so that
callers of malloc() and free() are no longer required to hold Giant.
Alan Cox continues to clean up the locking in the VM system pushing down
Giant in several of the VM related system calls. Jeffrey Hsu committed
locking for TCP/IP protocol control blocks in the network stack. John
Baldwin committed the changes to the p_canfoo() API to use thread
credentials for subject threads and added appropriate locking for the
targer process credentials. Support for adaptive mutexes on SMP systems
as well as the new IA32 PAUSE instruction were also committed in May.
The kernel tracing facility KTRACE also received an overhaul such that
the majority of its work was pushed out into a worker thread allowing
trace points to no longer require Giant. Andrew Reiter has also been
pushing down Giant in several system calls.

Bosko continues to work on light-weight interrupt threads for i386. Most
of the bugs in the turnstile code have been found and fixed; however,
the turnstile and preemption patches have temporarily been put on hold
so that more emphasis can be placed on fixing bugs and making -current
more stable in preparation for 5.0 release in November. Alan Cox and
Andrew Reiter are continuing the work mentioned above. Jeff Roberson is
also working on fixing the current vnode locking in VFS. Peter Wemm has
also started to tackle TLB issues on SMP in the i386 pmap again as well.

TCP Hostcache

Contact: Andre Oppermann <oppermann@pipeline.ch>

The current cache for the TCP metrics is embedded directly into the
routing table route objects. This is highly inefficient as every route
has an empty 56 Byte large metrics structure in it. TCP is the only
consumer (except the MTU and Expiry field) of the structure. A full view
of the Internet routes (110k routes) has more than 6 Mbyte of unused
overhead due to it. The hit rate today is at only approx. 10% in
webserver applications. The TCP hostcache will move this entire metrics
structure from the routing table to the TCP stack. Every entry is a host
entry so a simple hash table is sufficient to keep the entries. Its
implementation is much like the TCP Syncache.

The hostcache is going through testing on our servers and will be ready
for committing in September. The results of the TCP metrics measurement
will be used to tune the cache.

These students will analyse the tcpdumps of five major Swiss newspaper
websites which give a representative overview of the user structure in
Switzerland. The nice thing about Switzerland is that is has a very good
mix of Modem/ISDN, leased line, Cable, ADSL and 3G/GSM/GPRS users. Every
Internet access technology is represented. The goal is to analyze the
behavior of all TCP sessions to the monitored sites. Parameters to be
analyzed include TCP session RTT, RTT variance, in/outbound BDP, MSS
changes, flow control behavior, packet loss, packet retransmit and
timing of HTTP traffic to find optimal TCP parameter caching method.

If you have any other metrics you think is useful please contact me so I
can put that into the job description for the Students. The study will
be made in September and October.

A lot of remaining PR's and Bugs have been closed. All relevant rpc
concerning patches have been committed. Thanks go to Alfred and Ian
Dowese.

Jean-Luc Richier <Jean-Luc.Richier@imag.fr> has made a patch available
which adds IPv6 support to all remaining rpc servers. See
ftp://ftp.imag.fr/pub/ipv6/NFS/NFS_IPV6_FreeBSD5.0.gz and
ftp://ftp.imag.fr/pub/ipv6/NFS/0README_NFS_IPV6_FreeBSD5.0 We will check
his code and add it to CURRENT ASAP.

A first commit part from TIRPC99 has been done. I'm working now on
porting the remaining parts so when FreeBSD 5.0 gets released, it will
be TIRPC99 based. This will happen together with the NetBSD project, as
they use the same codebase as we do.

<trustedbsd-discuss@TrustedBSD.org>

The TrustedBSD Project has been busy in May and June, developing new
features, presenting on the technology at the FreeBSD Developer Summit,
and improving the readiness of the MAC branch for integration into the
main FreeBSD tree. The migration to dynamic labeling in the TrustedBSD
MAC framework is complete, with all policies now making use of dynamic
labels in the kernel. This permits policies to associate arbitrary
additional security data with a variety of kernel objects at run-time.
Implement mac_test, a sanity checking module. Pass labels as well as
objects to each policy entry point to reduce knowledge of label storage
in the policies. Implement mac_partition, a simple jail-like policy.
Adapt the MAC framework for process locking.

Improve support for sockets: provide a peerlabel maintained for stream
sockets (unix domain, tcp), entry points for accept, bind, connect,
listen. Improve support for IPv4 and IPv6 by labeling IP fragment
reassembly queues, and providing entry points to instrument fragment
matching, update, reassembly, etc. Locally disable KAME if_loop mbuf
contiguity hack because it drops labels on mbufs: we need to make sure
the label is propagated. Label pipes and provide access control for
them. Improve vnode labeling: now handle labeling for devfs, pseudofs,
procfs. Fix interactions between MAC and ACLs relating to the new
VAPPEND flag.

SELinux policy tools now ported to SEBSD. SEBSD now labels subjects and
file system objects. Provide ugidfw, a tool for managing rules for the
mac_bsdextended policy.

Massive diff reduction. KSEIII merged. Main tree integration will begin
shortly.

Updated prototype code may be retrieved from the TrustedBSD CVS trees on
cvsup10.FreeBSD.org.
