Introduction:

2004 started with another exciting two months for the project. FreeBSD
5.2 was released in early January and then quickly followed in February
with the 5.2.1 bug-fix release. Looking forward, we are expecting a
late-April release date for FreeBSD 4.10, and mid-summer date for
FreeBSD 5.3. And don't forget to support the FreeBSD vendors and
developers by buying a copy of the latest CD or DVD sets.

Thanks,

Scott Long

Bluetooth stack for FreeBSD (Netgraph implementation)

Contact: Maksim Yevmenkin <m_evmenkin@yahoo.com>

Not much to report. Bluetooth Service Discovery Procotol daemon sdpd was
integrated with existing Bluetooth utilities. From now on users should
not use GNU sdpd (Linux BlueZ port).

Bluetooth HID profile implementation is almost complete. Thanks to Matt
Peterson < matt at peterson dot org > for giving me Bluetooth keyboard
and mouse for development.

Automatic sizing of TCP send buffers

Contact: Andre Oppermann <andre@FreeBSD.org>

The current TCP send and receive buffers are static and set to a
conservative value to preserve kernel memory. This is sub-optimal for
connections with a high bandwidth*delay product because the size of the
TCP send buffer determines how big the send window can get. For high
bandwidth trans-continental links this seriously limits the maximum
transfer speed per TCP connection. For example a 170ms RTT and a 32kB
send buffer limit the speed to approximately 1.5Mbit per second even
thought you might have a 10Mbit pipe.

This project makes the TCP send buffer to automatically adapt to the
optimal buffer size for maximal link usage. In the case above this would
be a buffer of approximately 220kB. The main challenge is to have a
stable and reliable measurement of the link parameters and manage the
kernel memory properly and in a fair way. We don't want to have a few
connections to monopolize all available socket buffer space and many
edge cases have to be considered. The first implementation will be tuned
conservatively but even that will provide significantly better
performance than the static buffers currently. Work on this project is
already in progress.

If nothing bad happened, the icc patches got committed around the date
of the deadline for submissions of this report. Please search the
archives of -current and/or cvs-all for more information.

The next steps in this project are to

-   fix the kernel to also run without problems when compiled with icc
    v8
-   fix the kernel if some problems surface after more people give it a
    try
-   get some ports to compile with icc

Disk and device I/O

Contact: Poul-Henning Kamp <phk@FreeBSD.org>

In the overall area of disk and device I/O, a significant milestone was
reached with the implementation of proper reference counting on dev_t.
We are now able to properly allocate and free dev_t. Cloning device
drivers also had the job made easier for them with the addition of the
unit number management routines.

It is not quite decided which will be the next step in the quest for a
truly SMPng I/O subsystem, but a leading candidate is to implement the
device-access vnode bypass to get more concurrency in the system:
Instead of taking the tour through the vnodes for each i/o operation on
a device we will go directly from the file descriptor layer to
DEVFS/SPECFS. In addition to Giant-less disk I/O, this should enable us
to pull the entire tty subsystem and the PTY driver out from under Giant
and we expect that to improve the "snappiness" of the system measurably.

FreeBSD GNOME Project Report

  FreeBSD GNOME Project Site.   URL: http://www.FreeBSD.org/gnome/
  ----------------------------- ------------------------------------

Contact: FreeBSD GNOME Team <gnome@FreeBSD.org>

It has been a year since our last status report, but we haven't slowed
down. Since the last report, Alexander Nedotsukov (bland) and Pav
Lucistnik (pav) have joined the FreeBSD GNOME team. GNOME 2.4 was
released back in September 2003, followed by 2.4.1 and 2.4.2. We are
actively working on getting GNOME 2.6.0 out the door at the end of
March. GNOME 2.6 Beta releases can be obtained via the project URL
above.

To help make GNOME 2.6.0 our best release to date, we have created a
script to automate the upgrade from GNOME 2.4. We also have a new GNOME
package build server that builds and serves i386 packages for all
supported FreeBSD releases. We plan on having the GNOME 2.6.0 packages
available the moment 2.6.0 hits the ports tree.

Included in the release of GNOME 2.6 is GTK+ 2.4, the next installment
in the GTK+ 2 series. Because GTK+ 2 has become very stable over the
past few years, the FreeBSD GNOME Team is pushing for GTK+ 2 support to
be included by default in all applications that support it. This has
already been done with Mozilla, Firefox, and Thunderbird. A complete
GNOME Desktop and application environment can already be built using
only GTK+ 2. The ultimate goal is to phase GTK+ 1 out of the ports tree.

FreeBSD Package Grid

Contact: Kris Kennaway <kris@FreeBSD.org>

Distributed package builds are currently done using a set of home-grown
shell scripts for managing, scheduling and dispatching of package builds
on the client machines. This has been sufficient for our needs in the
past, but has a number of significant shortcomings that limit future
growth. I am rewriting the package build scripts to work on top of Sun
GridEngine (ports/sysutils/sge), as a client application of a "FreeBSD
package grid". Some of the design goals for the new system are:

-   Better robustness against machine failure, and more efficient
    scheduling of build jobs
-   Support for remote build machines, to make better use of machine
    resources and clusters that are not on the same LAN as the build
    master
-   Ability for other committers to submit port build jobs to the
    system, for testing of changes, new ports, etc.

FreeBSD ports monitoring system

  FreeBSD ports monitoring system   URL: http://portsmon.firepipe.net/index.html
  --------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------

Contact: Mark Linimon <linimon_at_lonesome_dot_com>

Thanks to the loan of a box by Will Andrews, the system has been moved
into production. The previous installation at lonesome.com now refers
you to the new system. As part of the installation, a preliminary FAQ
was added.

The database is updated once per hour.

New reports available include ones about ports marked DEPRECATED, since
that function has now been incorporated into bsd.port.mk. (The author
hopes that this will allow the port deprecation process to be much more
visible to the general FreeBSD user community.) In addition, a report
for ports marked FORBIDDEN was added (the code was essentially the
same).

The next topic of interest is to try to identify ports which are slave
ports because the status of these ports is not currently being updated
automatically. This problem also affects FreshPorts. PR ports/63683 is
an attempt to address this problem. Also, preliminary work has been done
on creating some graphs and charts for various statistics, and in
creating a tool to browse port dependencies for the entire ports tree.

Some general observations about the trends in ports PRs can be made:

-   In the past 6 months, the amount of time to get ports PRs committed
    has dropped dramatically. (This is especially true of PRs for new
    ports.)
-   The queue of PRs for existing ports that are unmaintained has
    similarly been trimmed. Both of these two items are due in large
    part to a few very active committers (how do they ever get their
    "real" work done?) Thanks, guys, you know who you are.
-   There is still a fairly high number of PRs (~400/~750) which apply
    to existing ports, and have been assigned to a FreeBSD committer.
    This represents around 370 individual ports. We seem to have a much
    harder time getting these numbers to go down; basically, we just
    hold our own most weeks. This is somewhat disappointing.
-   The number of ports marked BROKEN has jumped dramatically, currently
    standing at over 250 (for i386-current). This represents less a
    sudden problem as it does Kris' effort to bring existing brokenness
    to people's attention -- thus, a much larger percentage of ports
    with build errors are now labeled as BROKEN.
-   Approximately two-thirds of the port build errors are still due to
    compilation problems, primarily from the gcc3.3 import. Another 10%
    fail to install correctly. The reasons for the others are more
    varied.

FreeBSD/arm Status Report

Contact: Olivier Houchard <cognet@FreeBSD.org>

Development goes reasonably fast, right now it boots single user. It is
still very simics-centric, and it deserves a huge cleanup and a few bug
fixes, but there's already a decent amount of code to work with, mostly
taken from NetBSD. I now plan to work on real hardware support (as soon
as I can get some), to get the missing userland bits (mainly rtld and
the pthread libs) so that I can build a full world.

Work on the PMAP overhaul has been put into gear. A lot of issues will
be addressed, including support for sparse physical memory and of course
SMP. Performance will be addressed to the extend possible, but
functionality has priority. The redesign will lay the foundation for
NUMA support where possible. An example of this is limiting TLB
shootdowns to processors that actually have or had TLBs belonging to the
PMAP loaded. Of course, without NUMA hardware the implementation of NUMA
support is quite limited.

installed packages. The Project releases an ISO builded with FreeSBIE
scripts, to show what they can do. On Sunday 29 February 2004, FreeSBIE
1.0 was released and it had a great success, as there were post on
Slashdot.org, OSnews, DaemonNews and BSDForums. Thanks to the huge
amount of feedback they got, FreeSBIE Developers are now developing new
features such as support for archs different from i386. Website redesign
is on the way too.

Move to Perforce is done. I spent some time on building a common

Contact: Tim Kientzle <kientzle@FreeBSD.org>

libarchive, with complete documentation, has been committed to -CURRENT.
bsdtar should follow soon. For a few months, gtar and bsdtar will both
be available in the base system. Once bsdtar is in the tree, I hope to
resume work on libpkg and my pkg_add rewrite.

Note that bsdtar is not an exact replacement for gtar: it does some
things better (reads/writes standard formats, archive ACLs and file
flags, detects format and compression automatically), some things worse
(does not handle multi-volume archives or sparse files) and a few things
just different (writes POSIX-format archives by default, not
GNU-format). The command lines are sufficiently similar that most users
should have no problems with the transition. However, people who rely on
peculiar options or capabilities of gtar may have to look to ports.

Move ARP out of routing table

Contact: Andre Oppermann <andre@FreeBSD.org>

The ARP IP address to MAC address mapping does not belong into the
routing table (FIB) as it is currently done. This will move it to its
own hash based structure which will be instantiated per each 802.1
broadcast domain. With this change it is possible to have more than one
interface in the same IP subnet and layer 2 broadcast domain. The ARP
handling and the routing table will be quite a bit simplified
afterwards. As an additional benefit full MAC address based accosting
will be provided. Work on this project is already in progress.

NanoBSD

NanoBSD, src/tools/tools/nanobsd, is a tool for stuffing FreeBSD onto
small disk media (like CompactFlash) for embedded applications. The disk
image is built with three partitions, two for software images and one
for configuration files. Having two software partitions means that new
software can be uploaded to the non-active partition while running off
the active partition.

The first really public version has been committed and many suggestions
and offers of patches have started pouring in.

Network Stack Locking

  -------
  Links
  -------

Contact: Sam Leffler <sam@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Robert Watson <rwatson@FreeBSD.org>

This project is aimed at converting the FreeBSD network stack from
running under the single Giant kernel lock to permitting it to run in a
fully parallel manner on multiple CPUs (i.e., a fully threaded network
stack). This will improve performance/latency through reentrancy and
preemption on single-processor machines, and also on multi-processor
machines by permitting real parallelism in the processing of network
traffic. As of FreeBSD 5.2, it was possible to run low level network
functions, as well as the IP filtering and forwarding plane, without the
Giant lock, as well as "process to completion" in the interrupt handler.

Work continues to improve the maturity and completeness of the locking
(and performance) of the network stack for 5.3. The network stack
locking development branch has been updated to the latest CVS HEAD,
tracking a variety of FreeBSD changes, including tracking and driving
changes in the interface and device cloning APIs, push-down and fixes to
locking in the Berkeley Packet Filter, consistency improvements in
allocation flags for network objects, diagnosis of excessive acquisition
of Giant in various system callouts and timeouts, removal of Giant from
several system callouts, "const"-ification of a number of global
variables in the network stack (IPv4, IPv6, elsewhere) as part of
ananalysis of locking requirements, fine-grain locking of a number of
pseudo-interfaces (disc, loopback, faith, stf, gif, tap, tun), IP
encapsulation and tunneling, initial review and locking of parts of PPP
and SLIP, experimentation with PCB assertions on IPv6, additional socket
locking assertions, graphing of the FreeBSD sockets layer to support
locking analysis, merging of theMT_TAG to m_tag conversion to improve
the ability to queue packets, moving of the debug.mpsafenet tunable to
controlling Giant over the forwarding plane to Giant over the entire
stack("dual-mode" to support non-MPSAFE protocols), adaption of existing
network lock assertions to also assert Giant when running non-MPSAFE,
analysis of high cost of select() locking, improved locking and
synchronization annotations, TCP callouts run MPSAFE, logtimeout() runs
MPSAFE, uma_timeout() runs MPSAFE, callout sampling instrumentation,
loadav() runs MPSAFE, AppleTalk locking begun: AARP locked down and DDP
analysis, rawcb list locked, locking analysis of mrouter and IP ID code,
IGMP locked, IPv6 analysis begun, IPX/SPX analysis begun, PPP timeouts
converted to callouts, Netgraph analysis begun. Many of these changes
have not yet been merged to the main FreeBSDtree, but this is a work in
progress.

In related work on Pipe IPC (not quite network stack locking),
substantial time was invested in diagnosing an increase in the cost of
pipe allocation since FreeBSD 4.x, as well as coalescing the several
allocations needed to create a pipe, as well as moving to slab
allocation so as to amortize the cost of pipe initialization. Future
work here will include caching the VM structures supporting pipe
buffers.

Recent contributors include Robert Watson, Sam Leffler, MaxLaier,
Maurycy Pawlowski-Wieronski, Brooks Davis, and many others who are
omitted here only by accident.

is in progress also, though it is not yet clear how well it goes along

Testbed for testing and qualification of TCP performance

Contact: Andre Oppermann <andre@FreeBSD.org>

The TCP performance test and qualification testbed is an automated
environment that simulates various common and uncommon end-to-end
network and link characteristics such as delay, bandwidth limitations,
congestion, packet drops, packet corruption and out of order arrival.
The testbed automatically steps through all link types and tests various
TCP optimizations and parameter adjustments. In the end all data is
graphically arranged and compared against standard behaviour and each
other to judge the positive or negative effects of the modifications.
Work on this project has just started and is based on FreeBSDs dummynet.

and applications running on FreeBSD. All of the work resulted in this
project will be contributed back to the FreeBSD project.

Thanks to many volunteers' help, by this time of writing, we have
finished more than 60% of the translation of the FreeBSD Handbook. We
plan to submit a preliminary translation of the FreeBSD website as well
as the FreeBSD Handbook when most part of them were finished, which is
expected to happen in a couple of months. The snapshot of the
documentation translation effort could be accessed through the URL
listed above.

The project also supported individual efforts on porting applications
(especially software that supports Simplified and/or Traditional
Chinese) to FreeBSD. We are also doing some research on making FreeBSD
kernel and base system more i18n-aware.

Verify source reachability option for ipfw2

  ------- ---------------------------------------------------------
  Links   
          URL: http://www.nrg4u.com/freebsd/ipfw_versrcreach.diff
  ------- ---------------------------------------------------------

Contact: Andre Oppermann <andre@FreeBSD.org>

The verify source reachability option for ipfw2 checks if the source IP
address of a packet entering the machine is reachable at all. Thus if we
can't send a packet back because we don't have a route back we don't
have to forward it because two way communication isn't possible anyway.
It is more than likely that such a packet is spoofed. This option is
almost the same as what is known on Cisco IOS as "ip verify unicast
source reachable-via [any|ifn]". Using this option only makes sense when
you don't have a default route which naturally always matches. So this
is useful for machines acting as routers with a default-free view of the
entire Internet as common when running a BGP daemon (Zebra/Quagga or
OpenBSD bgpd).

One useful way of enabling it globally on a router looks like this: ipfw
add xxxx deny ip from any to any not versrcreach or for an individual
interface only: ipfw add xxxx deny ip from any to any not versrcreach
recv fxp0

The "geomification" of vinum has made some progress. I now have all
basic setups working (concatenated plexes, striped plexes, RAID5 plexes,
and RAID1), but I still have to implement correct error handling and
status change handling.

Still missing is a userland tool, so currently you still have to use
"old-style" vinum to configure your setup.

I have been producing weekly summaries of commits and the surrounding
discussions as reported on the cvs-src mailing list. These summaries are
posted to -current on Sunday evenings and archived on the Web. The
reception has been overwhelmingly good. As of the end of February,
Polish translations are being produced by Lukasz Dudek and Szymon
Roczniak; they are also planning to translate the older summaries.
