FreeBSD Services Control (fsc)

Contact: Tom Rhodes <trhodes@FreeBSD.org>

FSC has been moved into the ports system (see sysutils/fsc) and
continues to improve outside of the ports tree. Some interesting work is
being done in the area of services control, system boot, and a
simplification of the process. Stay tuned for more information in status
reports that follow.

Open tasks:

1.  Test, test, test. Feedback is really important to this project.

  TRE home page   URL: http://laurikari.net/tre/
  --------------- --------------------------------

Contact: Gábor Kövesdán <gabor@FreeBSD.org>

It has been decided to implement the optimizations and extensions as a
more isolated layer and not directly in TRE itself. Since the last
report there has been some progress in this direction and the code has
been significantly refactored. It does not work yet in this new form but
it is close to a working state. Apart from this, the multiple pattern
matching needs some debugging and some minor features are missing.

Open tasks:

1.  Finish multiple pattern heuristic regex matching.
2.  Implement GNU-specific regex extensions.
3.  Test performance, standard-compliance and correct behavior.

Contact: <freebsd-doc@FreeBSD.org>

We continue to make progress in committing the work produced as part of
Google Code-In 2011; an overview of the status is at
http://wiki.freebsd.org/GoogleCodeIn/2011Status. Doc committers and GCIN
mentors are encouraged to go through the list and help shepherd
outstanding tasks into the tree.

We are planning a full day of Documentation Summit on the day preceding
the August 2012 DevSummit in Cambridge, UK. This follows a successful
DocSummit day held at BSDCan in May 2012. Further details are available
at: http://wiki.freebsd.org/201208DevSummit.

A doc sprint took place over IRC (#bsddocs on EFnet) in early July,
setting out plans for reviving the marketing team and a strong desire
for a new, more organized website.

A lot of progress and momentum has built up with creating and updating
documentation and website content over the last few months. Also read
the doceng report for the recent infrastructure improvements.

Anyone wishing to help with this effort is welcome to join us and say
hello either on the freebsd-doc mailing list, or #bsddocs on EFnet IRC.

Open tasks:

1.  Review the website content and remove outdated parts or update when
    applicable.
2.  Go through the doc idea list on the wiki and start working them out.

Contact: Core Team <core@FreeBSD.org>

The FreeBSD Project is pleased to announce the completion of the 2012
Core Team election. The FreeBSD Core Team acts as the project's "Board
of Directors" and is responsible for approving new src committers,
resolving disputes between developers, appointing sub-committees for
specific purposes (security officer, release engineering, port managers,
webmaster, et cetera), and making any other administrative or policy
decisions as needed. The Core Team has been elected by FreeBSD
developers every 2 years since 2000.

Peter Wemm rejoins the Core Team after a two-year hiatus, with new
members Thomas Abthorpe, Gavin Atkinson, David Chisnall, Attilio Rao and
Martin Wilke joining incumbents John Baldwin, Konstantin Belousov and
Hiroki Sato.

The complete newly elected core team is:

-   Thomas Abthorpe <tabthorpe@FreeBSD.org>
-   Gavin Atkinson <gavin@FreeBSD.org>
-   John Baldwin <jhb@FreeBSD.org>
-   Konstantin Belousov <kib@FreeBSD.org>
-   David Chisnall <theraven@FreeBSD.org>
-   Attilio Rao <attilio@FreeBSD.org>
-   Hiroki Sato <hrs@FreeBSD.org>
-   Peter Wemm <peter@FreeBSD.org>
-   Martin Wilke <miwi@FreeBSD.org>

The new Core Team would like to thank outgoing members Wilko Bulte,
Brooks Davis, Warner Losh, Pav Lucistnik, Colin Percival and Robert
Watson for their service over the past two (and in some cases, many
more) years.

The Core Team would also especially like to thank Dag-Erling Smørgrav
for running the election.

The ports tree slowly approaches 24,000 ports. The PR count still is
close to 1200.

In Q2 we added 7 new committers and took in one commit bit for safe
keeping.

The Ports Management team have been running -exp runs on an ongoing
basis, verifying how base system updates may affect the ports tree, as
well as providing QA runs for major ports updates. Of note, -exp runs
were done for:

-   automake update
-   cmake update
-   xorg update
-   png update
-   Fix make reinstall
-   Implement USE_QT4 in bsd.ports.mk
-   KDE4 update
-   XFCE4 update
-   bison update
-   perl5.14 as default
-   ruby1.9 as default
-   ruby1.8 update
-   bsdsort regression test

A lot of focus during this period was put into getting the ports tree
into a ready state for FreeBSD 9.1.

A significant step forward was the implementation of OptionsNG.

A record number of Port Managers attended BSDCan 2012, with five being
present to partake in the week of events, culminating in a portmgr PR
closing session that dealt with 18 PRs in one day. You can see a group
photo at . While you are there, please click on the "Like" icon.

Beat Gaetzi has been doing ongoing tests with the ports tree to ensure a
smooth transition from CVS to Subversion. The tree was successfully
migrated the weekend of June 14, 2012.

Open tasks:

1.  Looking for help getting ports to build with clang.
2.  Looking for help fixing ports broken on CURRENT. (List needs
    updating, too.)
3.  Looking for help with Tier-2 architectures.
4.  ports broken by src changes.
5.  ports failing on pointyhat.
6.  ports failing on pointyhat-west.
7.  ports that are marked as BROKEN.
8.  When did that port break?
9.  Most ports PRs are assigned, we now need to focus on testing,
    committing and closing.

Kernel

FreeBSD/at91 Improvements

  ---------------------------- -------------------------------------------
  Links                        
  FreeBSD on ATMEL AT91 Wiki   URL: http://wiki.freebsd.org/FreeBSDAtmel
  ---------------------------- -------------------------------------------

Contact: Warner Losh <imp@FreeBSD.org>

FreeBSD's Atmel support has languished for some time. A number of
improvements were urgently needed as demand for newer SoCs has
materialized. New SoC support is not hard, but it does wind up copying a
lot of code. I have started down the path to make it easier to do. I had
planned on making it table driven. But then I discovered with dts files
that Atmel was producing.

So, I plan on moving to using Atmel's .dsti files, or variations on
them. They have .dsti files for all the AT91SAM9 parts. This should
allow us to support new SoCs and boards faster.

However, there are some challenges with this approach. Pin multiplexing
seems undefined in Atmel's dts file. Only a few of the devices are
well-defined at the present time. And the encoding seems to be immature.

So we have a target-rich port that is quite ripe for refactoring.

Open tasks:

1.  Update the base system libfdt to a version that supports include.
2.  Write a .dtsi for Atmel AT91RM9200.
3.  Write .dti files for all supported boards.
4.  Help sort out the pin multiplexing issue.
5.  Refactor existing board files to make new ones easier in the
    interim.
6.  Knock yourself out and implement board support for new CPUs.

Work is underway to create an IETF draft-compatible Multipath TCP
implementation for the FreeBSD kernel.

A key goal of the project is to create a research platform to
investigate a range of multipath related transport issues including
congestion control, retransmission strategy and packet scheduling
policy. We also aim to provide full interoperability with the Linux
kernel implementation being developed at Université catholique de
Louvain.

We expect to release code and results at the project's home page as it
progresses.

  --------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contact: Gleb Smirnoff <glebius@FreeBSD.org>

The project is aimed at moving the pf(4) packet filter out of single
mutex, as well as in general improving of its FreeBSD port.

The project is near its finish, the code is planned to go into head
after more testing and benchmarking. If you are interested in details,
please see the corresponding email thread on freebsd-pf (see links).

Open tasks:

1.  Rewrite the pf(4) ioctl() interface so that it does not utilize
    in-kernel structures. That would make ABI more stable and ease
    future development.

Our translation work has slightly moved on to handbook from the www/ja
(CVS) or htdocs (SVN) subtree, since almost translated web page contents
were updated to the latest English counterparts.

During this period, we translated the 8.3-RELEASE announcement and
published it in a timely manner. Newsflash and some other updates in the
English version were also translated as soon as possible.

For FreeBSD Handbook, translation work of the "cutting-edge" and
"printing" sections have been completed. Some updates in the "linuxemu"
and "serialcomms" section were done. At this moment, "bsdinstall",
"cutting-edge", "desktop", "install", "introduction", "kernelconfig",
"mirrors", "multimedia", "pgpkeys", "ports", "printing", and "x11"
chapters are synchronized with the English versions.

Open tasks:

1.  Further translation work of outdated documents in ja_JP.eucJP
    subtree.

BSD sort(1) has been made the default sort utility in 10-CURRENT. It is
compatible with the latest GNU sort(1), version 8.15, except that the
multi-threaded mode is not enabled by default.

Open tasks:

1.  When the track record of the BSD sort(1) allows, remove GNU sort(1)
    from -CURRENT.
2.  Improve reliability of the multi-threaded sort and investigate the
    possibility of making it the default compilation mode.
3.  Investigate possibility of factoring out the sort functionality into
    a standalone library so that other utilities can also make use of
    it.

We are proud to announce that the FreeBSD Haskell Team has updated the
Haskell Platform to 2012.2.0.0, GHC to 7.4.1 as well as updated existing
ports to their latest stable versions. We also added a number of new
Haskell ports, and their count in FreeBSD Ports tree is now 336.

Open tasks:

1.  Test GHC to work with clang/LLVM.
2.  Add an option to the lang/ghc port to be able to build it with
    already installed GHC instead of requiring a separate GHC bootstrap
    tarball.
3.  Commit pending Haskell ports to the FreeBSD Ports tree.
4.  Add more ports to the Ports Collection.

Since the last update there has been 2 feature releases and 4 bug-fix
releases. A highlight of the changes made:

-   Support has been added for:

-   -   -j: controlling concurrency per stage
    -   pkgng: next generation package manager
    -   installing packages via repository
    -   dynamic defaults (loaded from /etc/make.conf)
    -   new options framework (aka OptionsNG)

-   Some of the fixes include:

-   -   correct assertions
    -   correct build logic
    -   retry when kevent receives EINTR
    -   correctly detecting installed ports
    -   many fixes in the build logic

A benchmark was run timing portbuilder against a standard ports build of
KDE (x11/kde4) in a clean chroot(8) environment. Portbuilder achieved a
build time of 2:21:16 compared to ports build time of 4:47:21 for an
decreased build time of 51% from using portbuilder.

Redports

          URL: http://www.redports.org/
  ------- -------------------------------

Contact: Bernhard Froehlich <decke@FreeBSD.org>

There was good progress in the last half a year and a lot of support
from different parties to make redports a stable and fast service.

A long known security concern within tinderbox was raised at the BSD-Day
in Vienna which was addressed by beat. That improves security and
isolation of the concurrent running jobs a lot and gives me peace of
mind.

We also recently got two beefy machines from the FreeBSD Foundation
which increases computing power a lot. So no more backlogs and your jobs
finish much quicker.

But as usual now that we have enough power I was able to make another
promise come true and integrated Ports QAT functionality into redports.
Ports QAT was an automated services that did a buildtest after each
commit to the official FreeBSD ports tree. If a build fails it sends out
mails and logfiles to the committer. That finds bad commits quickly and
allows the committer to fix it before the first user notices. The former
service stopped about 2 years ago and we had no proper replacement for
that task at hand. Now that this is fully integrated into redports it
also gives us all the nice benefits of a common platform.

Open tasks:

1.  Automatic build incoming patches from Ports PRs in redports and send
    results to GNATS database.
2.  People want an GCC testing environment on redports where all ports
    are build with lang/gcc47. To make that happen we need to patch the
    ports framework to handle that and correctly bootstrap with base
    GCC. This also gives us the possibility to build all our binary
    packages with a modern gcc and is easy to use for regular users.

Contact: Eitan Adler <eadler@FreeBSD.org>

During the beginning of this period, an update to the xorg distribution
for FreeBSD was made, dubbed xorg 7.5.2. This update included a new
flag, WITH_NEW_XORG, to get a more recent xorg distribution for those
with modern hardware. To get KMS support for recent Intel graphics
chipsets WITH_KMS must also be set. This requires a recent FreeBSD
10-CURRENT or FreeBSD 9-STABLE.

Open tasks:

1.  Switch to use FreeGLUT instead of libGLUT, since the latter is old
    and has there is no upstream support or releases any more. Work on
    this is mostly done.
2.  Update the xorg distribution to what is in the development
    repository. The xorg project recently did a new release, and the
    development repository contains this release. It needs more testing
    before it can be merged, and a CFT was sent out in the beginning of
    June. Work on this is ongoing.
3.  Decide how to handle the new and old xorg distributions. In recent
    xorg, a lot of legacy driver support has been dropped, therefore we
    need to maintain two xorg distributions to not loose a lot of
    hardware drivers. Currently, this is done by setting the flag
    WITH_NEW_XORG in /etc/make.conf, but a more practical solution is
    needed. This is especially important since the flag is not very user
    friendly, and since there currently will be no official packages for
    the new distribution.

For this year, we moved the time of the event earlier by six months, so
it was held on May 5, 2012 and it was co-located with the Austrian
Linuxweeks (Linuxwochen Österreich) in Vienna. We had many sponsors,
like the freshly joined FreeBSD Foundation, iXsystems, FreeBSDMall, BSD
Magazine, allBSD.de Projekt, that enabled us to continue our previously
launched series of multi-project BSD developer summits all around
Central Europe.

To kick off, there was a "stammtisch" (local beer meetup) organized in
the downtown of Vienna, at Kolar on the Friday evening before the event
— as usual. Then it was followed by the event on Saturday that brought
many interesting topics from the world of FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD:
running NetBSD as an embedded system for managing VOIP applications,
introduction to the Capsicum security framework, relayd(8), the load
balancer and proxy solution for OpenBSD, status update of the
developments around the FreeBSD ports tree, using DVCSs in clouds,
firewalling with pfSense, and mfsBSD. Please consult the links in the
report for the details.
