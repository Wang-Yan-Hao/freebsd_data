finstall - Graphical installer for FreeBSD

"finstall" is a graphical installer project for FreeBSD, sponsored by
Google during the 2007 Summer of Code. Its goal is to create a modern
installer, usable by both novice users and experts. Because it is
divided into front end and back end, it can potentially be used for
advanced purposes as system configuration, remote and custom installs,
etc. The project has resulted in a simple installer ISO image for i386
that can be used for new installations on empty hard drives. Development
has continued post-SoC but somewhat slowly; recently implemented
features include ZFS support and BSDStats support. To attract more
potential developers (especially those without an account on FreeBSD's
official development systems), the project has moved to SourceForge.
Future development plans include support for headless / remote installs,
partitioning, etc. Talks about finstall will be given at BSDCan 2008.

Open tasks:

1.  Remote / headless install support.
2.  Better partitioning support in the front end.
3.  GPT boot support.
4.  Fine grained package selection support.

The student application period for the Summer of Code is over and the
mentors and administrators are carefully reviewing the applications,
clarifying the project parameters, and deciding which students to
recommend for funding from Google.

This year we received over 100 student applications from students in 26
different countries. We also have over 60 potential mentors that we are
currently matching up with students. We will soon announce the winning
students on the summer of code website and the process of bringing these
students into our development community will begin.

Each student will again be given Perforce and wiki access and all
developers are encouraged to contact any students working in related
areas, as we don't want the students to have access to our community
only through their formal assigned mentor.

Open tasks:

1.  Help introduce our new summer of code students to FreeBSD
    development. Some students are very experienced at developing on
    FreeBSD and others are new to our environment and could use more
    assistance.
2.  Update the ideas database with new project ideas that you'd like to
    see for next year's Summer of Code.

ProPolice support for FreeBSD

  ------------- ---------------------------------------------------

  FreeBSD/SSP   URL: http://tataz.chchile.org/~tataz/FreeBSD/SSP/
  ------------- ---------------------------------------------------

Contact: Jérémie Le Hen <jeremie@le-hen.org>

This patch modifies the build infrastructure in order to use GCC's
stack-smashing protection (SSP, aka ProPolice) when building world,
kernel and ports. Don't forget to see the website and especially the FAQ
for a list of ports that fail to build with ProPolice. The patch extends
the meaning of src.conf(5) WITHOUT_SSP so as to prevent both building
libssp and using ProPolice when compiling. An interesting thing to note
is that libssp is GNU licensed (it is provided with GCC 4.2.1) but since
libc includes the mandatory symbols, programs won't be linked against
GNU libssp. A new knob USE_SSP has been also added for the ports
infrastructure, you can set it to "yes" in make.conf(5) and use USE_SSP=
on command-line to disable ProPolice for some ports. The patch has been
reviewed and should hopefully be committed soon. The port part hasn't
been reviewed yet, though.

Rewriting the TTY layer

  ----------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Perforce branch   URL: http://p4web.freebsd.org/@md=d&cd=//&c=7ru@//depot/user/ed/mpsafetty/?ac=83
  ----------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contact: Ed Schouten <ed@80386.nl>

About 10 weeks ago I started rewriting the TTY layer. The existing TTY
code is about 20-25 years old and has been extended over and over,
without really improving its design.

The new TTY layer will allow us to remove usage of the Giant from
drivers. It also includes an improved buffering mechanism, which has
more constant-time operations and prevents copying data multiple times
when moving data to userspace.

Right now the code should work quite well for most users. The code in
Perforce includes a new pseudo-TTY driver, which is finally capable of
destroying TTY's and their associated buffers when needed. The syscons,
uart and ucom drivers have also been ported to the new TTY layer.

The code is quite complete, but it still misses driver interaction for
carrier/connection detection and sending breaks. Many drivers still need
to be ported.

Open tasks:

1.  People who are willing to test. Contact me if you cannot perform
    Perforce checkouts.
2.  Not all drivers have been ported. Patches or hardware are welcome.
3.  Some changes could already be backported.

During the last three months there has mostly been bugfix and
documentation commits. The code is currently in a stable and full
featured state. The FreeBSD P4 USB project now has a fully symmetric USB
stack at API level and has been tested to work with AT91RM9200 ARM based
boards and USS820 based devices. There are currently two USB device side
drivers implemented, namely CDC Ethernet and Mass Storage (SCSI+BBB) so
that you can now make your custom USB Flash Disk using FreeBSD. Don't
confuse USB device side drivers with USB host side drivers.

Currently the USB P4 project is under review.

Ideas and comments with regard to the new USB API are welcome on the
FreeBSD USB Mailing List .

As one of the results of our January and February bugathons, we have
granted Volker Werth (vwe@) direct access to GNATS. During the past few
months he has been instrumental in working on several hundred PRs
(mainly src-related), and either closing them or helping users work
through issues they are having. There have been several commits to the
src tree that directly resulted from this. Welcome Volker!

As well, several new people are assisting us in classifying incoming
PRs, working with users, and reviewing patches. Among the most active
are Bruce Cran, Dylan Cochran, and Harrison Grundy. We appreciate
everyone's efforts.

As a direct result of the above, we have been able to hold the overall
PR count down to around 5300 (the peak was around 5500). despite the
facts that PR submissions have jumped recently, and the ports PR backlog
is a little higher than recent trends (due to the long freeze/slush
cycle). What is most encouraging, however, is not the absolute number,
as much as that we are handling incoming PRs much more quickly and
completely. While we are still not where we need to be, this trend is
very encouraging.

As well, The Bugbusting Team has learned some lessons about how we can
best involve new people in bugbusting, e.g., how to best leverage people
who have varying levels of experience and areas of interest. Our old
response of "just look through the bug reports and let us know if you
see anything that needs doing" tends to discourage all but the most
highly-motivated. Some of these ideas are being studied to figure how to
change our process flow.

There are still a number of good technical suggestions from the two
Bugathons that need to be written up and discussed. The first few have
resulted in the following: there are a few new web pages that include:
new PRs in the last 7 days; the web representation of the "recommended
by bugbusting team" list; and "PRs in feedback with no change for 2
months". (See above). Many more need to be added.

Much of the work of the second Bugathon was in identifying and closing
PRs for which fixes had already been committed. Others were identified
and relabled as 'patched' to move them along.

Open tasks:

1.  Think of some way for committers to only view PRs that have been in
    some way 'vetted' or 'confirmed.'
2.  Generate more publicity for what we've already got in place, and for
    what we intend to do next.
3.  Define new categories, classifications, and states for PRs, that
    will better match our workflow.

The foundation provided legal counsel for the project to understand the
impact of GPLv3 on the project and to create a policy on software
licenses. We approved a budget of $250,000 for 2008. We were a sponsor
for AsiaBSDCon and provided travel grants to three people to attend the
conference. We are a sponsor for BSDCan and the BSDCan Developer Summit.
We have approved travel grants for 10 people to attend BSDCan. We are
supporting projects that will provide Java 1.6 binaries for FreeBSD 6.3
and 7.0. Join our mailing list to receive monthly updates. See you at
BSDCan!

portmgr is pleased to announce that Florent Thoumie (flz) has joined us.
We immediately put him to work on cleaning up the pkg_* tools.

After the extended freeze and then slush for 7.0R, we have finally been
able to start catching up on the backlog that built up during that time.

The ports count is now over 18,200. The PR count has only dropped to
around 1000. We are still turning around PRs fairly quickly, but are not
making progress on the backlog.

We have only been able to do 2 -exp runs recently. Although a number of
PRs have been closed, we are still at 57 portmgr PRs.

During this period, GNOME has been updated to 2.22.0. Also, a new port
for linux emulation (emulators/linux_base-f8) has been introduced for
general testing.

XFree86 has been removed. (It had been deprecated for quite some time;
modern development seems to be happening in X.Org.) This simplifies the
infrastructure. A few other stale ports have been reaped.

The following large changes are in the pipeline:

-   Upgrade of KDE to 4.0 (being tested)
-   Upgrade of automake to 1.10.1
-   Upgrade of gettext to 0.17
-   Upgrade of libtool to 1.5.26 (not 2.x at this time)
-   Upgrade of m4 to 1.14.11
-   Introduction of Perl 5.10

We are currently building packages for amd64-5, amd64-6, amd64-7,
amd64-8, i386-5, i386-6, i386-7, i386-8, sparc64-6, and sparc64-7. Note,
however, that RELENG_5 will reach end of its supported life May 31,
2008, and package builds for those 2 buildenvs will stop as of that
date.

We have been able to use some new machines to speed up the package
builds (in particular, amd64) -- in fact, to the point that we are now
outrunning the capacity of some of the mirrors to stay current. A
solution for the problem is being investigated.

We have added 4 new committers since the last report.

Open tasks:

1.  Most of the remaining ports PRs are "existing port/PR assigned to
    committer". Although the maintainer-timeout policy is helping to
    keep the backlog down, we are going to need to do more to get the
    ports in the shape they really need to be in.
2.  Although we have added many maintainers, we still have over 4,000
    unmaintained ports (see, for instance, the list on portsmon). We are
    always looking for dedicated volunteers to adopt at least a few
    unmaintained ports. As well, the packages on amd64 and sparc64 lag
    behind i386, and we need more testers for those.

Contact: Bjoern A. Zeeb <bz@FreeBSD.org>

The multi-IPv4/v6 jails project was resumed in early January after
previous work had been abandoned in 2006.

As an alternate solution to full network stack virtualization, this work
shall provide a lightweight solution for multi-IP virtualization. The
changes are even more important because of the emerging demand for IPv6.

The current status includes updated user space utilities. Kernel side
has grown support for multiple IP addresses for both address families in
jails, as well as no IP addresses at all. 32bit and jail version 1
backward compatibility support were implemented.

The development was moved to perforce and patches for early adopters are
available.

Open tasks:

1.  The TODO list can be found in the TODO file in perforce.
2.  Regression tests and review.

-   unionfs-p20-2.diff
-   unionfs-p20-3.diff
-   unionfs-p20-4.diff
-   unionfs-p20-5.diff

Open tasks:

1.  Robert Watson has pointed out that unionfs-p20-5.diff has some
    problems around how it treats sockets. We are researching those.

  Design Document   URL: http://wiki.freebsd.org/IdeasWebApp
  ----------------- ------------------------------------------

Contact: Murray Stokely <murray@FreeBSD.org>

A prototype web application has been written for the
http://www.FreeBSD.org website which allows authenticated users to add
new development ideas or comment and vote on ideas added by others. This
application is a proposed replacement for the static webpage that is
currently maintained with project ideas for summer of code students and
others looking to get involved with FreeBSD.

Some of the features currently available include:

-   Allows anyone to propose a new idea.
-   Allows anyone to comment and vote on previously proposed ideas.
-   Provides an RSS feed of the newest ideas.
-   Provides an RSS feed of the comments/votes for any specific idea.
-   Allows one to sort and search the ideas list by category, proposer,
    votes, summary title, or full text, and subscribe to RSS feed of
    search results.
-   Anonymous ideas/comments are hidden by default until cleared by a
    moderator.
-   Moderator bits to be set for certain users so that they can moderate
    the above (can subscribe to an rss file for unmoderated ideas and
    comments needing their attention).
-   Import functionality to import the current ideas.xml file.
-   Graphs and statistics about the ideas in the database are provided.

The code is checked into perforce under
//depot/user/murray/www/apps/django/ideas/... and I would eventually
like to see this hosted on FreeBSD.org hardware, linked from the main
website, and checked into www/apps/django/ideas.

Open tasks:

1.  A thorough security review of the code is needed. If you have
    experience with reviewing web applications for sql injection,
    cross-site scripting, and other vulnerabilities please contact me.
    The application uses the Django framework.
2.  Better import/export tools to get the data from our current
    ideas.xml web app into the database and back out again.
3.  More usability review and suggestions needed to make this a
    compelling replacement to the current static XML system.
