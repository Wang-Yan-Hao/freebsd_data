Projects

Bringing up OMAP3

Contact: Warner Losh <imp@bsdimp.com>
Contact: Mohammed Farrag <mfarrag@FreeBSD.org>

OMAP3 Emulation:

-   Step #1: qemu-omap3 isn't ported to FreeBSD yet. So,
-   Step #2: Use qemu-omap3 on Gentoo Host ..
-   Step #3: Is the end reached ?! No, bcz qemu-omap3 is not full. So,
    go to step #4.
-   Step #4: Use Meego >> Download Ubuntu 10.10 >> Install it, and
-   Step #5: Compile FreeBSD kernel, Create root file system, mkimage,
    Emulate using Meego.

Open tasks:

1.  Device Drivers for OMAP3 Processors.

GEOM-based ataraid(4) Replacement — geom_raid.

Contact: Alexander Motin <mav@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: M. Warner Losh <imp@FreeBSD.org>

A new RAID GEOM class (geom_raid) was added to FreeBSD 9-CURRENT, to
replace ataraid(4) in supporting various BIOS-based software RAIDs.
Unlike ataraid(4) this implementation does not depend on legacy ata(4)
subsystem and can be used with any disk drivers, including new CAM-based
ones (ahci(4), siis(4), mvs(4) and ata(4) with `options ATA_CAM`). To
make code more readable and extensible, this implementation follows
modular design, including a core part and two sets of modules,
implementing support for different metadata formats and RAID levels.

Support for such popular metadata formats is now implemented: Intel,
JMicron, NVIDIA, Promise (also used by AMD/ATI) and SiliconImage.

Such RAID levels are now supported: RAID0, RAID1, RAID1E, RAID10,
SINGLE, CONCAT.

For any all of these RAID levels and metadata formats this class
supports full cycle of volume operations: reading, writing, creation,
deletion, disk removal and insertion, rebuilding, dirty shutdown
detection and resynchronization, bad sector recovery, faulty disks
tracking, hot-spare disks. For Intel and Promise formats there is
support for multiple volumes per disk set.

See the graid(8) manual page for additional details.

Sponsored by: Cisco Systems, Inc. and iXsystems, Inc.

Open tasks:

1.  Implement metadata modules for other formats (DDF, Highpoint, VIA,
    ...).
2.  Implement transformation modules for other RAID levels (RAID5, ...).

HAST (Highly Available Storage)

Contact: Pawel Jakub Dawidek <pjd@FreeBSD.org>

Contact: Mikolaj Golub <trociny@FreeBSD.org>

HAST development is progressing nicely. Mikolaj Golub who contributes to
HAST is now a FreeBSD src committer. Some changes worth noting since the
last report:

-   Compression of the data being sent over the network. This can speed
    up especially synchronization process.
-   Optional checksuming for the data being send over the network.
-   Capsicum sandboxing for secondary node and hastctl.
-   Chroot+setuid+setgid sandboxing for primary node.
-   Allow administrators to specify source IP address for connections.
-   When changing role wait for a while for the other node to switch
    from primary to secondary to avoid split-brain.
-   Many bug fixes.

Contact: Nathan Whitehorn <nwhitehorn@FreeBSD.org>

On March 14th, sysinstall was replaced on the 9.0 snapshot media by a
new, modular installer called BSDInstall. This adds support for a wide
variety of new features while simplifying the installation process.
Testing before the 9.0 release will be very much appreciated -- CD and
memory stick images for a variety of platforms are linked from the
BSDInstall wiki page.

Interesting features:

-   Install CD media are always live CDs
-   Installations spanning multiple disks
-   Wireless setup
-   GPT disk formatting
-   Virtualization friendly: can install from a live system onto disk
    images
-   Easily hackable and more modular than sysinstall
-   Greater flexibility: shells available throughout the installation

Work is presently ongoing to integrate this installer with the backend
provided by pc-sysinstall (second wiki link).

Open tasks:

1.  ZFS installation support.
2.  IA64 disk setup.

AFS is a distributed network filesystem that originated from the Andrew
Project at Carnegie-Mellon University. The OpenAFS client implementation
has not been particularly useful on FreeBSD since the FreeBSD 4.X
releases. Work covered in previous reports brought the OpenAFS client to
a useful form on 9.0-CURRENT, though with some rough edges. Since our
last report, we have fixed several bugs that were impacting usability,
and we expect the upcoming 1.6.0 release to be usable for regular client
workloads (though not heavy load). Accordingly, we have submitted
packaging for inclusion in the Ports Collection (PR ports/152467).

There are several known outstanding issues that are being worked on, but
detailed bug reports are welcome at port-freebsd@openafs.org.

Open tasks:

1.  Update VFS locking to allow the use of disk-based client caches as
    well as memory-based caches.
2.  Track down races and deadlocks that may appear under load.
3.  Integrate with the bsd.kmod.mk kernel-module build infrastructure.
4.  Eliminate a moderate memory leak from the kernel module.
5.  PAG (Process Authentication Group) support is not functional.

Work on 2.0 is rapidly coming to an end. We released RC1 around Feb 25
2011 and so far it seems to be rather stable. 2.0 is our first major
release in 2 years and almost all limitations of the previous version
has been overcome.

Open tasks:

1.  Finish testing RC1 and certify for release.

RCTL, aka Resource Containers

Contact: Edward Tomasz Napierala <trasz@FreeBSD.org>

Most of the code has already been merged into CURRENT. There are two
remaining problems I would like to solve before 9.0-RELEASE - see
below - but otherwise, the code is stable; please test and report any
problems. You will need to rebuild the kernel with "options RACCT" and
"options RCTL". The rctl(8) manual page should be a good introduction on
how to use it.

This project was sponsored by The FreeBSD Foundation.

Open tasks:

1.  Reimplementing %CPU accounting and CPU throttling.
2.  Making jail rules persistent - right now, one cannot add jail rule
    before that jail is created, which makes it impossible to put them
    into /etc/rctl.conf; also, rules disappear when jail gets destroyed.

ZFSv28 available in FreeBSD 9-CURRENT

Contact: Pawel Jakub Dawidek <pjd@FreeBSD.org>

Contact: Martin Matuska <mm@FreeBSD.org>

ZFS v28 is now in HEAD! Test, test, test and test. Pretty please. New
features include:

-   Data deduplication.
-   Triple parity RAIDZ (RAIDZ3).
-   zfs diff.
-   zpool split.
-   Snapshot holds.
-   zpool import -F. Allows to rewind corrupted pool to earlier
    transaction group.
-   Possibility to import pool in read-only mode.

The bugmeister team is happy to welcome Eitan Adler (eadler@) as the
newest GNATS-only contributor. Eitan has been helping triage new bugs as
they come in, as well as making good progress on many of the older bugs,
closing duplicates and obsolete bugs and contacting submitters for extra
information where necessary. For the first time in a long time we
managed to get below 6000 open PRs, in no small part due to Eitan's
efforts. Welcome aboard!

PRs continue to be classified as they arrive, by adding 'tags' to the
subject lines corresponding to the kernel subsystem involved, or man
page references for userland PRs. Reports are generated from these
nightly, grouping related PRs into one place, sorted by tag or man page.
This allows an interested party working in one area or on one subsystem
to easily find related bugs and issues in the same area, which has
proven quite effective in getting some of the older bug reports closed.
These reports can all be found by following the third link above.

We continue to look for ideas for other reports that may help improve
the PR closure rate. If you have any suggestions for reports which would
contribute positively to the way you work, please email bugmeister@ and
we shall try to produce such a report.

Our clearance rate of PRs, especially in kern and bin, seems to be
improving. The number of non-ports PRs has stayed almost constant since
the last status report.

As always, anybody interested in helping out with the PR queue is
welcome to join us in #freebsd-bugbusters on EFnet. We are always
looking for additional help, whether your interests lie in triaging
incoming PRs, generating patches to resolve existing problems, or simply
helping with the database housekeeping (identifying duplicate PRs, ones
that have already been resolved, etc). This is a great way of getting
more involved with FreeBSD!

Open tasks:

1.  Try to find ways to get more committers helping us with closing PRs
    that the team has already analyzed.

FreeBSD NYI Admins Status Report

Contact: NYI Admins Team <nyi-admin@FreeBSD.org>

The FreeBSD.org site at New York Internet is progressing, though more
slowly than we had hoped. Due to problems with the old power controllers
and serial console servers, new equipment has been bought by the FreeBSD
Foundation. Installing the new equipment required re-racking all the
existing servers which was done by the local FreeBSD team (Steven
Kreuzer and John Baldwin).

For basic infrastructure at the site (such as DHCP, DNS, console etc.)
the FreeBSD Foundation bought some new servers which are in the process
of being configured.

The FreeBSD Ports team are currently using 9 of the NYI servers for
package building.

Open tasks:

1.  We are looking for a storage system (15TB+) for keeping replicas of
    all the main FreeBSD.org systems, a full ftp-archive mirror, site
    local files etc.

Contact: Deb Goodkin <deb@FreeBSDFoundation.org>

We created our 2011 budget. Some of our plans for 2011 include spending
$125,000 on project development and $75,000 on equipment to build up
FreeBSD facilities in three locations.

We were proud to be a sponsor for AsiaBSDCon 2011 in Tokyo. We also
committed to sponsoring BSDCan 2011 in May, and EuroBSDCon 2011 in
October. The Foundation was also represented at SCALE in Los Angeles,
Indiana LinuxFest in Indianapolis, and Flourish in Chicago.

Completed Foundation-funded projects: Five New TCP Congestion Control
Algorithms project by Swinburne University and Resource Containers
project by Edward Napierala.

In February we visited companies in the Bay Area that use FreeBSD. Our
goal was to promote FreeBSD, better understand their interests and
needs, and help facilitate stronger relationships between these
companies and the Project. The presentations we gave included the
benefits of FreeBSD, Project road-map, potential areas of collaboration,
case studies, and how the Foundation supports the project. By visiting
in person we were able to show our commitment to the Project and respond
directly to questions and concerns they may have had. We were pleased
with the positive responses we received and plan on visiting more
companies in the future.

We are funding two new projects. The first project is Implementing
Support of GEM, KMS, and DRI for Intel Drivers by Konstantin Belousov.
The second is Improving the Maturity of IPv6 Support of FreeBSD and
PC-BSD by Bjoern Zeeb.

We continued our work on infrastructure projects to beef up hardware for
package-building, network-testing, etc. This includes purchasing
equipment as well as managing equipment donations.

Stop by and visit with us at BSDCan (May 13-14) and SouthEast LinuxFest
(June 10-12).

The work above as well as many other tasks we do for the project,
couldn't be done without donations. Please help us by making a donation
or asking your company to make a donation. We would be happy to send
marketing literature to you or your company. Find out how to make a
donation at http://www.FreeBSDfoundation.org/donate/.

Network Infrastructure

DIstributed Firewall and Flow-shaper Using Statistical Evidence (DIFFUSE)

          URL: http://caia.swin.edu.au/urp/diffuse/downloads.html
  ------- ---------------------------------------------------------

Contact: Sebastian Zander <szander@swin.edu.au>
Contact: Grenville Armitage <garmitage@swin.edu.au>

DIFFUSE is a system enabling FreeBSD's IPFW firewall subsystem to
classify IP traffic based on statistical traffic properties.

With DIFFUSE, IPFW computes statistics (such as packet lengths or
inter-packet time intervals) for observed flows, and uses ML (machine
learning) to classify flows into classes. In addition to traditional
packet inspection rules, IPFW rules may now also be expressed in terms
of traffic statistics or classes identified by ML classification. This
can be helpful when direct packet inspection is problematic (perhaps for
administrative reasons, or because port numbers do not reliably identify
applications).

DIFFUSE also enables one instance of IPFW to send flow information and
classes to other IPFW instances, which then can act on such traffic
(e.g. prioritise, accept, deny, etc.) according to its class. This
allows for distributed architectures, where classification at one
location in your network is used to control fire-walling or rate-shaping
actions at other locations.

DIFFUSE is a set of patches for FreeBSD-CURRENT. It can be downloaded
from the project's web site. The web site also contains a more
comprehensive introduction, including application examples, links to
related work and documentation.

In February 2011 we released DIFFUSE v0.2.2. This release contains a
number of bug fixes and new features. Most notably since version 0.2
there is a tool to build classifier models, and there is a feature
module and classifier model to classify Skype traffic.

We hope to release DIFFUSE v0.3 soon. Keep an eye on the freebsd-ipfw
and freebsd-net mailing lists for project-related announcements.

The project is now complete, with the following code available in the
svn head branch:

-   Modular congestion control framework.
-   Khelp (Kernel Helper) and Hhook (Helper Hook) frameworks.
-   Basic Khelp/Hhook integration with the TCP stack.
-   Enhanced Round Trip Time (ERTT) Khelp module.
-   Modularised implementations of NewReno, CUBIC, H-TCP, Vegas,
    Hamilton-Delay and CAIA-Hamilton-Delay congestion control
    algorithms.

In addition to the code, a large set of documentation was committed (see
the following man pages: cc(4), cc_newreno(4), cc_cubic(4), cc_htcp(4),
cc_vegas(4), cc_hd(4), cc_chd(4), h_ertt(4), cc(9), khelp(9), hhook(9))
and a technical report was released which evaluates the computational
overhead associated with TCP before and after the project's changes.

A candidate patch to MFC the modular congestion control framework to the
8-STABLE branch is ready for testing here. If you try the patch, please
send a note detailing your experience (positive or negative) to Lawrence
Stewart.

Thanks go to the FreeBSD Foundation for funding this work, to the
project's technical reviewers for providing detailed feedback, and to
all FreeBSD users who have provided testing feedback thus far.

Open tasks:

1.  Test 8-STABLE MFC candidate patch and do the merge in time for
    8.3-RELEASE.

Journaled Soft Updates

Contact: Jeff Roberson <jeff@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Kirk McKusick <mckusick@mckusick.com>

All known problems with journaled soft updates have been fixed in head.
If you have any problems while running with journaled soft updates,
please report them to us.

We have addressed several performance issues that have been brought to
our attention. If you have any performance problems while running with
journaled soft updates, please report them to us.

We have improved the recovery of resources when running with soft
updates on small (root) filesystems. We anticipate being able to use
soft updates for root filesystems in the 9.0 system.

We expect to have journaled soft updates default to enabled in the 9.0
system. We encourage users of -CURRENT to enable journaled soft updates
to help shake out any remaining performance problems and bugs.

Linux Compatibility Layer - DVB and V4L2 Support

          URL: http://people.FreeBSD.org/~nox/dvb/
  ------- ------------------------------------------

Contact: Juergen Lock <nox@FreeBSD.org>

Following (separate) discussions on the mailing lists I have made
patches to add DVB and V4L2 ioctl translation support to the Linux
compatibility layer, allowing Linux apps like SageTV, Skype, and Flash
to use DVB/ATSC tuners and webcams that previously only worked for
native FreeBSD apps. (Most of this hardware uses Linux drivers via the
multimedia/webcamd port.)

Open tasks:

1.  Handle the remaining ioctls that (I think) are not used by DVB
    tuners/cameras supported by webcamd (it only supports USB devices,
    the unhandled ioctls mostly have to do with video overlays and
    hardware MPEG2 decoding on analog or DVB tuners, features that AFAIK
    don't exist on USB hardware.)
2.  Make the DVB support a port because there were concerns putting it
    in base due to the LGPL in one of the header files even though I
    already separated out the code into an extra kld.
    (linux_dvbwrapper.ko)
3.  Get the patches polished and committed. :) (Until they are you can
    check my DVB page and the freebsd-emulation@ mailing list for
    updates.)

A new FreeBSD Handbook section covering the Highly Available STorage, or
HAST developed by Pawel Jakub Dawidek has been recently added. In this
section, you will learn what HAST is, how it works, which features it
provides and how to set it up. It also includes a working example on how
it can be used together with devd(8) and CARP. Enjoy your reading.

Benedict Reuschling contributed the translation of the new handbook
section about HAST, while Benjamin Lukas was working on the first
translation of the firewall chapter of the handbook. The committers to
the German Documentation Project were busy with keeping the existing
German documentation up-to-date. The website translations were also kept
in sync with the ones on FreeBSD.org.

We tried to re-activate committers who did not contribute for some time
but most of them are currently unable to free up enough time. We hope to
gain fresh contributor blood as we are getting occasional reports about
bugs and grammar in the german translation.

Open tasks:

1.  Submit grammar, spelling or other errors you find in the german
    documents and the website.
2.  Translate more articles and other open handbook sections.

for the translation work into the main tree was also finished. Since
outdated and/or non-translated documents also remain in both
doc/ja_JP.eucJP and www, further translation work is still needed. Some
progress has been made in the Porter's Handbook as well in this period.

Webcam and DVB Compatibility List

This is the FreeBSD Webcam, DVB, and Remote Control Compatibility List.
The main goal of this page is to give an exact answer about which
application works with a given cam or DVB. Combinations of the hardware
and software mentioned in this table are known to work.

Please add more lines to the table or ask me to do so by just sending a
mail with your Cam/DVB information. Please note: you should only add
information you have seen working and not you may think of or imagine
that they could work. The contact information (name and/or email addr)
is optional.

Open tasks:

1.  Move this to a real database in where FreeBSD enduser could self
    insert their gadgets, like the FreeBSD Laptop Compat List.

  ------------------------- -------------------------------------------------

Contact: Colin Percival <cperciva@FreeBSD.org>

FreeBSD is now able to run on t1.micro and cc1.4xlarge instances in the
Amazon EC2 cloud. FreeBSD 8.2-RELEASE is stable subject to the
limitations of the instance type (e.g., running ZFS on a micro instance
with only 600 MB of RAM doesn't work very well), but FreeBSD 9.0 has
significant stability issues.

A list of available FreeBSD AMIs (EC2 machine images) appears on the
FreeBSD/EC2 status page.

Open tasks:

1.  Bring FreeBSD to a wider range of EC2 instance types.
2.  Completely rework the locking in head/sys/i386/xen/pmap.c to
    eliminate races and make 9.0-CURRENT stable under
    paravirtualization.
3.  Track down several possibly-related problems with scheduling and
    timekeeping.
4.  Fix other issues shown on the FreeBSD/EC2 status page.

Contact: Bernhard Froehlich <decke@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Juergen Lock <nox@FreeBSD.org>

FreeBSD could be a much better platform for a Home Theater PC than it
currently is. We are focusing on improving support for media center
applications by extending the major ports (MythTV, VDR, XBMC) and
creating some documentation to guide interested people.

In the last months we continued to work on HTPC relevant ports, improved
lirc and multimedia/webcamd remote control support. The last missing
major HTPC application VDR (Video Disk Recorder) has finally been
committed to the portstree as multimedia/vdr including 17 vdr plugin
ports.

Open tasks:

1.  Improve remote control support in webcamd and with lirc.
2.  Port more Media Center applications (Enna, me-tv, ...)
3.  Create a small guide on how to build a great FreeBSD Home Theater
    PC.

Old linux_base ports (all which are not used by default in some release)
where marked as deprecated with a short expiration period. The reason is
that all those ports are long past their end of life and do not receive
security updates anymore. Unfortunately this is also true for the
linux_base ports which are still used by default in the releases, but no
replacement is available ATM (see open tasks).

The linux-f10-pango port was updated to a more recent version whoch does
not have a security problem by generating a linux-RPM in a VM with
"FreeBSD" as the vendor (see the links section for a HOWTO).

Open tasks:

1.  Decide which RPM based linux distribution+version to track next for
    the linux_base ports, create ports for it and test for compatibility
    with our kernel code.

Portmaster

  Links   
          URL: http://dougbarton.us/portmaster-proposal.html
  ------- ----------------------------------------------------

Contact: Doug Barton <dougb@FreeBSD.org>

The latest version of portmaster contains numerous improvements aimed at
large-scale enterprise users. Particularly, support for the
--index-only/--packages-only code has been significantly improved. Some
of the highlights include:

-   New --update-if-newer option which takes a list of ports and/or a
    glob pattern on the command line and only updates those that are out
    of date. This feature is very useful for ensuring that the packages
    needed for updating a system are all available and up to date on the
    package building system.
-   The portmaster.rc file can now be stored in the same directory as
    the script itself, which aids in shared access to the script (for
    example over an NFS mount)
-   More features now work (or work better) with --index-only, including
    --check-depends

Open tasks:

1.  I have received some support for items E.2 and E.3 on the web page
    listed above so I will be putting some effort into those areas in
    the coming months. I also have in mind to split out the "fetch" code
    to be its own script, in part to support goal E.2, and to allow for
    more efficient parallelization when downloading multiple distfiles
    (especially for multiple ports that download the same distfile).
    This will also allow me to set a global limit for the number of
    parallel fetches which should aid users on slow links.
