Introduction

After a long, exhausting, yet very productive third quarter of 2005
FreeBSD 6.0 has been released. Many activities were put into the
background in order to make this release the success it has become.

Nonetheless, we received a tremendous amount of reports covering various
projects that either found their way into FreeBSD 6.0 already or have
started to develop in, what is now known as 7-CURRENT. The EuroBSDCon
and the Developer Summit in Basel next week will be a good opportunity
to help some of the ideas herein to take off.

Last round we had the pleasure to introduce our accepted Google Summer
of Code projects. Now, that the summer is over, we are even more pleased
to include reports about the outcome of these projects. Some already
found their way into the tree or the general public otherwise - most
ocularly the new webdesign.

Unfortunately, this publication has been delayed for various reasons -
the before mentioned release of 6.0 being one of them. Thus, some of the
reports might no longer be as up to date as they were when we received
them and we encourage you - even more this time - to also visit the
weblinks to get more recent information.

Thanks again to everyone who submitted reports, and our sincere
apologies for running late this time.

By the end of August I managed to modify the release building process to
build a live CD that loads the front and backends. It could install all
the distfiles, install the ports tree and had minimal support to install
and uninstall packages.

Since the end of the Summer of Code I have worked to integrate the new
Lua backend. This has been successful, with it now past the point of the
BSDINSTALLER-BETA-1 release. It can install the distfiles but not the
ports tree or packages yet.

Contact: Christoph Mathys <cmathys@bluewin.ch>

During the "Summer of Code" I worked on csup (a rewrite of CVSup in C).
It already supported checkout-mode, so my task was to implement support
for cvs-mode. The biggest part of the project was to implement support
for rcs-files. As "byproducts" I also wrote the necessary code to create
nodes/hardlinks and to update files using the rsync-algorithm. For what
I know, the code works fine, but errorhandling is practically
inexistent.

Open tasks:

1.  Errors should be properly handled
2.  Support to get fixups
3.  The hard part to support rcs file updates is done, but there is no
    checksum, some options are not honored and the performance could be
    improved

The new website has gone live! Thanks to Emily Boyd for all her hard
work. We still have a lot of work to do to integrate suggestions that
have been made by users since we went live. The new CSS design makes it
much easier to rapidly change the look and feel of the site, so it is
easy to experiment. We're still looking for more HTML/CSS designers to
help us improve the site.

Fuse for FreeBSD is the outcome of my "ssh based networking filesystem
for FreeBSD" SoC project.

The kernel interface for the comprehensive userspace filesystem API
provided by the ( Fuse project ) has been implemented for FreeBSD (6.x
and 7.x), under the BSD license. This has the benefit of opening up the
possibility of porting the rich collection of Fuse based filesystems to
FreeBSD.

Now it's ready for consumption by a broader audience. The
sysutils/fusefs-kmod , sysutils/fusefs-libs , sysutils/fusefs-sshfs
ports can be expected to be integrated into the FreeBSD ports tree in
the next few days (the ports were created and are maintained by Anish
Mistry, and Simon Barner's careful review also helps a lot).

Open tasks:

1.  Implement missing features like extended attributes and
    attribute/name caching (with timeout).
2.  Resolve problems with autotools and integrate userspace
    modifications into the Fuse codebase.
3.  Port Fuse based filesystems and language bindings to FreeBSD.
4.  Create sysfs (Fuse based filesystem interface to sysctl).
5.  Test, test, test among a broad variety of circumstances.

  -------------------- ------------------------------------------------

Contact: Ivan Voras <ivoras@yahoo.com>

Gjournal provides GEOM-level journaling and COW capabilities to storage
devices. Unfortunately, it cannot be used as a substitute for filesystem
journaling (fsck is still needed when gjournal device is used to host
filesystems). Development has slowed down, and the existing code needs
much more testing. If there is continued interest in it, I'll probably
split the functionalities into two projects, one handling COW and one
handling the journaling, in order to make the code cleaner.

Open tasks:

1.  More testing is needed.

Support for moving and renaming objects in gvinum was completed at the
end of August 2005. All gvinum objects (drives, subdisks, plexes, and
volumes) can be renamed, and subdisks can be moved from drive to drive.
Also, a man page for gvinum was created.

Open tasks:

1.  Update FreeBSD Handbook chapter on vinum to reflect gvinum. Slowly
    in progress, but hopefully done by the end of the year, workload
    permitting.

The project met all the scheduled goals, and following are the new
features implemented in libalias:

-   integration with IPFW in kernel land
-   support for 4.x and 5.x as kld
-   converted from a monolithic to a modular architecture, added the
    ability to load/unload at runtime support for new protocols (modules
    work both in kernel and user land)
-   added logging support in kernel land

Fell free to suggest other improvements.

This summer, we've had the pleasure of having two Google Summer of Code
students hacking on our SNMP monitoring machinery. Victor worked on
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
implementing the Host Resources, TCP and UDP MIBs in bsnmpd while
Shteryana started on client-side SNMP tools.

With these modules and tools, a FreeBSD installation can be monitored
without having to install any (heavy!) third-party tools.

Open tasks:

1.  While the modules and the tools currently in Perforce are generally
    functional, they still need some tidying up (style(9)) and testing
    before they can be committed to CVS.

    At the time of this writing, the Hostres MIB is pretty much
    commit-ready in Perforce (//depot/user/philip/bsnmp/...), the other
    modules and tools live in //depot/projects/soc2005/bsnmp/... They'll
    be branched for tidying up and committing "Real Soon Now"[tm]

2.  Testers are very welcome. :-) Please let us know about any bugs!

The dependencies to kernel-only datastructures in netstat (ifnet, etc.)
have been removed almost completely (AppleTalk and IPX still needs
work). In order to remove the dependencies, the debugging features of
netstat had to be removed. However, a project to create a generic,
modular 'data structure' examination tool is ongoing, and the debugging
features factor out of netstat have been migrated to this tool.

Open tasks:

1.  Refactoring of the netstat code, create a modular version in the
    spirit of ifconfig.
2.  Data structure examination tool needs to be completed, current state
    is more that of a prototype.

launchd(8) for FreeBSD

  Links          
  Project Wiki   URL: http://wiki.freebsd.org/moin.cgi/launchd
  -------------- -----------------------------------------------

Contact: R. Tyler Ballance <tyler@tamu.edu>

In short, launchd can run perfectly fine on FreeBSD, and combined with
launchctl, it can be used to manage daemons through the launchctl(1)
interface. Jobs can be added and managed two ways as of yet from
launchctl(1). Using zarzycki@'s experimental "submit" command within
launchctl(1) or by using my lame/rudimentary/etc "launcher" format
(launchd/launchers/*.launch) which uses property(3) to parse out three
simple, and important details. The program label, path, and any program
flags. Using the "load" command, one can load the data into launchctl(1)
and then start the processes with the..."start" command. Jobs can be
removed/stopped with the "remove" command. The "limit" command still
throws launchctl(1) into an infinite loop, and yes, I plan on fixing
this.

There are some things that need to be fixed, first off, some sort of
boot time integration, whether as an init-replacement (i.e. PID 1, a la
Mac OS X) or as the first thing started from init, that kicks all rcng
things off. Along with, more importantly, a plist parser, so we can have
full compatibility with Mac OS X's launchd via Core Foundation.

I'm also trying to get launchd(8) relicensed with the BSD license, as
opposed to the APSL, anybody with tips, or methods for achieving this
goal, contact me at tyler@tamu.edu

Open tasks:

1.  Writing a light-weight plist (non-XML) parser with lex and yacc.

  ------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Contact: Michael Bushkov <>

The nsswitch / caching daemon project was developed within the Google's
Summer Of Code program. Almost all goals of the project were achieved.
Thanks to Brooks Davis and Jacques Vidrine, who were my mentors and
greatly helped me.

Nsswitch subsystem was extended to support new sources (services,
protocols, rpc, openssh and GT4). The testing of the Globus Grid Toolkit
4 patch (which adds support for nsswitch to GT4) is still to be done.
For nsswitch to support caching, the caching daemon was implemented on
top of the caching library, which was also developed during the SoC. The
current version of the daemon uses simple nscd-like configuration file
and seems to be stable. To complete the SoC project, the experimental
version of libc with in-process caching enabled was made. It's
benchmarking will be done in the nearest future.

There were some requests for caching daemon to be able to act like NSCD
(to perform the actual nsswitch lookups by itself), so it was modified
to support this feature. But current implementation has some
restrictions and requires a lot of testing. Right now the final
polishing is being made to the project's sources, so that they could be
added to the CURRENT

Open tasks:

1.  Extend caching daemon to support NSCD functionality
2.  Test Globus Grid Toolkit 4 patch
3.  Add support for MAC and audit related configuration files to the
    nsswitch

New MIBs are implmented for the BSNMP agent:

1.  HOST-RESOURCES-MIB ( http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2790.txt ). Philip
    is going to submit the code into the CVS repository.
2.  TCP-MIB with combined IPv4 & IPv6 support (
    http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4022.txt ). This new TCP-MIB is 100%
    backward compatible with the old one (v4 only). It adds a clear
    distinction between active and passive tcp endpoints and for each
    endpoint info about the process it belongs to.
3.  UDP-MIB with combined IPv4 & IPv6 support (
    http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4113.txt ). This new UDP-MIB is 100%
    backward compatible with the old one (v4 only) and it adds multiple
    instances support for the UDP endpoints and for each endpoint info
    about the processes using it.

Open tasks:

1.  For HOST-RESOURCES-MIB we are going to add support for more detailed
    memory stats based of libmemstat(3)
2.  The rest of the IPv6 MIBs.
3.  FreeBSD enterprise MIBs for supporting SNMP configuration (via SNMP
    SETs) for FreeBSD.

Contact: Ivan Voras <ivoras@yahoo.com>

Ggtrace is "GEOM gate tracer", utility to track I/O requests on a
storage device on FreeBSD. It uses the ggate facility of FreeBSD to
attach to a file or device and produces a device that can be used for
any I/O, including hosting filesystems.

I/O requests are presented in the form of a moving histogram that can be
used to discern which parts of the storage device are used most often.
One use of ggtrace is to analyze how filesystems arrange and access data
on storage devices.

The project is working and usable only on the RELENG_6 branch.

NEWCARD

  -------
  Links
  -------

Contact: Warner Losh <imp@freebsd.org>

Due to an email snafu, the June report was not submitted, so this report
covers since the last 6 months.

Summary: The 16-bit part of NEWCARD has been greatly enhanced. In
addition, power control has become interrupt driven. Some drivers make
use of the new functionality.

The pccard layer now exports the CIS for each device that is present,
even if there's no driver for the card or parts of the card.

The power up and reset sequence is now interrupt driven. This has
eliminated many of the long pauses that the system used to experience
after a card insertion. We can not play glitch-free audio while
inserting or removing a card.

A number of additional cards are recognized by PC Card. In addition,
drivers now can read the CIS for more information about the card.
Drivers have been enhanced to read the CIS for MAC addresses and the
like where appropriate.

The ed driver now attaches the mii bus of the AX88190 and AX88790 fast
ethernet PC Card chips. This allows better status reporting and
increased functionality for PHY chips that need some help. The ed driver
also supports the Tamarack TC5299J chipset (including attaching its MII
bus) now, the only open source OS that does so (TC5299J cards will work
with other open source OS, but they won't report their status or attach
a mii bus).

A number of bugs have been fixed in the pccard or cardbus drivers. Most
of these changes have been merged into the forthcoming 6.0. Others will
be merged after the release.

Open tasks:

1.  ExpressCard laptops have arrived with ExpressCard/54 and
    ExpressCard/34 slots. It is unknown the extent of the work necessary
    to support them.
2.  The ISA attachment of cbb needs work to make it fully functional.
3.  A CIS parser in userland needs to be written. The pccardc based CIS
    parser is OK, but it doesn't handle MFC cards too well. Ideally the
    parser would produce output that is compatible with the linux tool.
4.  A mechanism for CIS override is needed. We need a tool that will
    take an ascii representation of the CIS and produce a binary. We
    need a tool that will install the binary into the kernel and kernel
    modifications to switch from the CIS that's in the card to the faked
    up CIS.
5.  We need a mechanism for creating pseudo multi-function cards.
    Initially, it seems that all we really need is the ability for an
    arbitrary driver to add a sio companion, since that covers all the
    cases I'm aware of. Resources would need to be 'donated' from the
    creating driver to the sio card.
6.  It would be nice if we could move to a more common CIS parsing and
    dispatch. The CardBus side is wide open at the moment since none of
    the pci drivers use the CIS information outside of a few that get
    their MAC address via a standard interface.
7.  The ep driver needs work to make the newer ep cards that have mii
    bus on them actually probe and attach it. It needs to gain media
    support for the non-mii based cards. The 3C1 still needs work.
8.  The sn driver needs work to support many of the SMC91Cxxx PC Card
    devices. These are typically combination cards that need special,
    non-standard initialization.
9.  Power savings for 16-bit cards can be realized if we power them up
    at 3.3V rather than at 5.0V. Not all cards can support this, but
    many can and indicate this support in the CIS. Windows tries the
    3.3V configuration entries before the 5.0V ones. We should do the
    same.
10. Most of the changes that have been made to the pccard and cardbus
    layers can be merged back into RELENG_5.

Recently a lot of fixes, specially in handling format / rate conversion
and general stability was committed to -current. This include fixes for
most LOR's and new features (software volume handling for soundcards
without volume handling in hardware and the possibility to switch to
spdif).

A lot of effort was expended by Ariff (and other people) to come up with
those improvements. For this reason Ariff was "punished" with a commit
bit, so he is able to commit further improvements on his own.

This work is not integrated into 6.0-RELEASE because of some lose ends
(see 'sndctl' below).

You can help by looking at sound related PR's in GNATS and making
follow-up's which tell us if a problem still persists or if a PR can be
closed because the bug is fixed. Also feel free to submit patches for
anything on the TODO list below.

Open tasks:

1.  Update manual pages to reflect new features.
2.  Fix driver specific issues (via, t4dwave, maestro).
3.  Make all drivers MPSAFE.
4.  Rewrite some parts (e.g. a new mixer subsystem with OSS
    compatibility).
5.  sndctl(1): tool to control non-mixer parts of the sound system (e.g.
    spdif switching, virtual-3D effects) by an user (instead of the
    sysctl approach in -current); pcmplay(1), pcmrec(1), pcmutil(1).
6.  Plugable FEEDER infrastructure. For ease of debugging various feeder
    stuff and/or as userland library and test suite.
7.  Support for new hardware (envy24, Intel HDA).
8.  Performance enhancement (via 'slave'-channels, changes are under
    review)?
9.  Closer compatibility with OSS, especially for the upcoming OSS v4.
10. Close a lot of PR's.
11. Document the sound system in the FreeBSD Architecture Handbook .

The Kernel Stress Test Suite

  ------- ---------------------------------------------

Contact: Peter Holm <pho@freebsd.org>

The current version of the test suite took form in the beginning of the
year after discussions with Jeff Roberson, during a long period of
testing Jeff's VFS SMP work.

At that time, Daniel Seuffert donated a Thunder 7500 motherboard
complete with CPUs, RAM and coolers. This allowed me to do some serious
SMP testing.

Mid July Murray Stokely suggested adding a link from the 6.0 todo web
page to the Stress Test Status Page. At that time there were a few
reoccurring panics that made it hard to test the kernel for other
problems. Numerous people put a lot of hard work in fixing the panics
and livelocks found during the next months. At the same time others
stepped in and ran the test suite on their own hardware, thus increasing
the focus on kernel stability.

As of 6.0, the kernel stress test suite cannot panic the kernel.

Network infrastructure

OpenBSD dhclient import

Contact: Brooks Davis <brooks@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Sam Leffler <sam@FreeBSD.org>

The OpenBSD rewrite of dhclient has been imported, replacing the ISC
dhclient. The OpenBSD client provides better support for roaming on
wireless networks and a simpler model of operation. Instead of a single
dhclient process per system, there is one per network interface. This
instance automatically goes away in the even of link loss and is
restarted via devd when link is reacquired. To support this change, many
aspects of the network interface configuration process were overhauled.

The current code works well in most circumstances, but more testing and
polishing is needed. A few bugs are being tracked, but most of them are
edge cases.

Work on further interface configuration enhancements is underway for
FreeBSD 7.0.

Contact: Brooks Davis <brooks@FreeBSD.org>

This project is an attempt to clean up handling of network interfaces in
order to allow interfaces to be removed reliably. Current problems
include panics if Dummynet is delaying packets to an interface when it
is removed.

I have removed struct ifnet's and layer two common structures from
device driver structures. This will eventually allow them to be managed
properly upon device removal. This code has been committed and will
appear in 6.0. Popular drivers continue to be fixed. jhb's locking work
has identified and corrected many issues. rwatson has also committed
cleanups to the multicast code which fixed some issues in this area.

Contact: Andre Oppermann <andre@freebsd.org>

The fundraise has been very successful and I want to thank everyone who
has pledged their support and tipped the jar. The full amount plus a
little bit more has been raised in a very short timeframe. More
information on the exact amounts and their sponsors can be found at the
first link.

Due to the extended (and unexpected long) code freeze for the release
process of FreeBSD 6.0 (which is very high quality btw.) I've decided to
push back on working full time until the freeze is lifted. So far I've
done some work in the mbuf handling area and some other netinet cleanups
in my local repository.

Once FreeBSD 6.0 is released I resume my work on this project and many
changes and optimizations, as described in the first and second link,
will go into into FreeBSD-current.

Porting FreeBSD to the Xbox

Contact: Rink Springer <rink@rink.nu>
Contact: Ed Schouten <ed@fxq.nl>

As of 26th July 2005, it is possible to run FreeBSD on your Xbox with
minor patching effort. The framebuffer has initial support; The USB
ports, IDE- and audio controllers are fully supported; the only part
severely lacking now is the lack of support for the NForce Ethernet
controller.

Currently, efforts are focussing on eliminating the XBOX kernel option
and make the port self-detecting; this means the x86 and xbox kernels
will be identical. The goal is to provide native xbox support in
7-CURRENT.

Furthermore, a porting effort is planned from Linux' GPL-ed forcedeth.c;
not only the Xbox port will benefit from this but also all NForce
motherboard owners. The resulting driver could be kldload-ed to keep the
kernel GPL-free.

Open tasks:

1.  The xbox framebuffer driver should be merged in the VESA framework,
    so it can use syscons(4). Assistance on this would be very welcome!

Since our last status report, we have added a new member to the team:
Jean-Yves Lefort (jylefort). We have even spiced up our contact page
with pictures of ourselves and in some cases, a cute hippo. And our very
own Adam Weinberger (adamw) has been made a GNOME Project committer
heading up the Canadian English translation project.

We have finished the port GNOME 2.12 to FreeBSD. However, due to the
ports slush in preparation for 6.0-RELEASE, the update has not been
merged into the official ports tree. If people are eager to try out
GNOME 2.12 while waiting for the ports tree to fully thaw, we have
instructions on our website. GNOME 2.12 will be the first FreeBSD GNOME
release not to include support for FreeBSD 4.X. While 4.X is still a
very viable release for servers, it lacks many of the features needed
for a Desktop Environment such as GNOME. We do plan to continue support
of the GNOME development platform on 4.X, however. This includes Glib,
GTK+, libgnome, etc. A new porting component will be introduced with
GNOME 2.12 called, ``ltverhack''. This will help with future upgrades by
keeping shared library versions from needlessly changing.

The FreeBSD GNOME Project is also committed to providing our users with
a solid package experience. To that end, we have extended our Tinderbox
to build amd64 packages for all supported versions of FreeBSD for both
the production and development releases of the GNOME Desktop. The
development packages are even built with debugging symbols to better
help with reporting problems.

Open tasks:

1.  FreeBSD needs a HAL port. HAL will be vital for both GNOME and KDE
    in providing FreeBSD users with a smooth, elegant desktop
    experience. Once GNOME 2.12 has been merged into the ports tree,
    work will begin on making HAL on FreeBSD a reality. Contact
    gnome@FreeBSD.org if you are interested in helping.
2.  We need help with project documentation. In particular, we need help
    auditing the FAQ to make sure the content is still relevant, and we
    are not missing any key items. If you're interested, please contact
    gnome@FreeBSD.org .

I'm in the process of adding personalized newsfeeds to the website. For
each of your Watch Lists, you will also have a news feed just for that
watch list. Any commit to any port in your watch list will turn up on
your newsfeed. This fantastic new feature is available now for your RSS
pleasure at the BETA site . I've also been doing some work in the area
of supporting multiple platforms and architectures. This will allow
FreshPorts to correctly report that a port is broken, for example, on
i386, but not the other platforms. This feature will take note of
BROKEN, FORBIDDEN, and IGNORE for the following architectures:

-   alpha
-   amd64
-   i386
-   ia64
-   sparc64

And the following OSVERSIONS (subject to upgrade as new releases come
along):

-   492100
-   504102
-   600033
-   700001

Upcoming changes, in addition to the above, include:

1.  NOT_FOR_ARCHS
2.  ONLY_FOR_ARCHS
3.  IS_INTERACTIVE

I've been getting useful help from those on IRC. Thanks.

Open tasks:

1.  Complete the above.

A great deal of work has gone into the Ports Collection since the last
report in April, much of it behind-the-scenes.

As this report was being written, the 6.0 release was ongoing. Due to
the amount of time that it has taken to get 6.0 through the beta process
and into RC, we have been in ports freeze or slush for more than two
months. Unfortunately this has held back needed work on the ports
infrastructure.

The last major update to bsd.port.mk, in early May, was coordinated by
Kirill Ponomarew added a number of new features and closed 15 PRs.
Another similar set of changes has been tested and is ready for commit
after release.

portmgr welcomed two new members to its team: Erwin Lansing (who had
previously served as secretary, a role in which he is continuing) and
Clement Laforet. Clement is interested in speeding up the adoption of
new changes into the infrastructure, an item I'm sure that that everyone
can support. He promises to bring some fresh ideas to bear on this,
including the revitalization of devel/portmk as a testing ground for new
changes to bsd.port.mk in which the larger community can help test
changes.

The unfetchable distfile survey, which had been non-functional for quite
some time, was revitalized by Bill Fenner, with many new pages of
analysis added to it. Work is still ongoing. As a result of this
analysis, Bill and Mark Linimon eliminated nearly 100 lines of bogus or
outdated sites from bsd.sites.mk alone. They are continuing to work
through many other sites and ports as successive iterations of the
survey reveal more dimensions to the problem. We still need more help
from the larger community (see below).

Edwin Groothius has instituted a similar but slightly different survey.
His program attempts to visit each listed mastersite for each distfile
and determine whether or not a newer version might be available. The
results are stored in a database. This is helping to automate a function
that had been left up to individual maintainers to look through numerous
websites to try to find these updates. The survey has been hugely (if
not universally) popular. Already, dozens of port updates have been
committed as a direct result of this service.

In addition, portsmon, which had been down due to a machine change, was
moved to portsmon.FreeBSD.org and updated during this time. Many thanks
to Erwin Lansing for providing the loan of this machine, and Will
Andrews for having provided the loan of the previous incarnation.

Both of the above surveys are now generating periodic email to ports
maintainers advising them of problems. This is in addition to recurring
email from portsmon. The surveys allow individual maintainers to ask to
receive no further email. portsmon does not currently have this but it
needs to be added. Although we have no doubt the mail can in some cases
be annoying (especially given the fact that there will inevitably be
some false positives), the fact is that these emails have had a direct
impact on the quality on the ports. We ask for patience from the
community while each of us continues to fine-tune the algorithms
controlling what email is generated. (Because of the number of emails
these systems generate, it is impossible to go over every one
individually for a sanity check).

As a result of bounces from the above email, we have also been resetting
maintainers who have become unreachable.

Pav Lucistnik has done a great deal of work on the Porter's Handbook,
including some much needed reshuffling and cleanup. Expanded sections
include Apache and PHP; Configure Scripts; Dealing With Shared
Libraries; Dealing With User Configuration Files; Handling Empty
Directories; Python; and Ruby. In addition, Edwin Groothius has
contributed a section on OPTIONS, and numerous other sections have been
improved by good suggestions from various other contributors.

A new article, "Maintaining and contributing to the FreeBSD Ports
Collection", has been prepared by Sam Lawrance and has been reviewed and
is ready for commit. This document attempts to codify the rights and
responsibilities of ports maintainers, which until now had merely been
"community lore" as discussed on various mailing lists.

We continue to add new committers regularly, 8 since the last report.

The ports collection now contains over 13,500 ports. This is an increase
of over 750 since the last report in April.

Open tasks:

1.  portmgr would like to ask maintainers and committers alike to go
    through the status of their ports on the two distfile surveys, both
    the one that shows unfetchable current distfiles and the one that
    shows possibly updated distfiles. This is an effective way to
    quickly help improve our user's perception of the state of the
    ports.
2.  A great deal of progress has been made in cracking down on ports
    that install files outside the approved directories and/or do not
    deinstall cleanly (see "Extra files not listed in PLIST" on
    pointyhat ). These ports are now a small minority thanks to the
    dedicated efforts of a large number of individuals.
3.  We still have a large number of PRs that have been assigned to
    committers for some time (in fact, they constitute the majority).
    portmgr members are now going through this list and asking each
    committer to either commit them or release them to the general pool
    so that someone else may work on them. In addition, the existing
    policies for inactive maintainers (two weeks for maintainer- timeout
    on PRs; three months for maintainer reset if no activity) are going
    to be much more actively pursued than in the past, where the
    policies were more honored in the breach than in the observance. The
    goal is to try to bring the Ports Collection as up-to-date as
    possible. (While there has been progress on many fronts, there are
    still areas where ports are suffering from bit-rot.)

The Ports Tinderbox is a packaged system for building FreeBSD ports in a
clean environment. It can be used to test new ports, updates to existing
ports, or simply as a package building engine. Tinderbox uses the same
underlying code that the official FreeBSD package build cluster,
pointyhat, uses. So if a port builds under Tinderbox, it is guaranteed
to build on pointyhat.

More and more FreeBSD committers and ports maintainers are starting to
use Tinderbox. We just released version 2.1.0 which added much-requested
PostgreSQL support as well as fixed many bugs. We expect a 2.1.1 release
soon with some additional bug fixes.

With the 2.1.0 release of Tinderbox, we have branched the code base so
that we can focus on larger features in our HEAD branch while still
producing stable releases on a more frequent basis. The biggest new
feature planned for Tinderbox 3.0 is clustering support which is being
spearheaded by Ade Lovett (ade).

Open tasks:

1.  At this point, we really need help with documentation. Work has
    begun on creating man pages for the various Tinderbox commands, but
    we need help to churn them out at as faster rate. If you have strong
    mdoc fu, and interested in helping us out, please contact
