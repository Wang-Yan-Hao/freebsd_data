Introduction

This report covers FreeBSD-related projects between July and September
2010. It is the third of the four reports planned for 2010. During this
period, we were victims of one of the biggest BSD events of the year —
EuroBSDCon. We hope that the ones of you who have been able to attend it
have enjoyed your stay. Another good news is that work on the new minor
versions of FreeBSD, 7.4 and 8.2, is progressing well.

This report, with 55 entries, is the longest report in the whole history
and shows a good condition of the FreeBSD community.

Thanks to all the reporters for the excellent work! We hope you enjoy
reading it.

Please note that the deadline for submissions covering the period
between October and December 2010 is January 15th, 2011.

Contact: Adrian Chadd <adrian@FreeBSD.org>

FreeBSD-CURRENT runs on the AR9132 SoC. Minor platform-specific tweaks
are needed to use it on a given piece of hardware (eg., where in flash
the Ethernet MAC address is stored.) The AR910x wireless MAC/PHY is
supported. The only available test platform uses a 2.4GHz radio; 5GHz
11a mode has not been tested. As with other Atheros chipset support in
FreeBSD, 11n support is not yet finished. The current development
platform is the TP-Link TP-WN1043ND 802.11n wireless bridge/router. It
is currently being successfully used as a 11bg access point.

Open tasks:

1.  USB support is currently not functional.
2.  There is currently no support for the Realtek Gigabit switch/PHY
    chip. This is being worked on.

Contact: Ivan Voras <ivoras@FreeBSD.org>

pkg_patch is a tool meant to be used with the rest of the pkg_*
utilities whose job is to create and apply binary patches to FreeBSD
package archives. The SoC project was successfully completed but there
are some open issues about the integration of the tool in the FreeBSD
system. Some changes are necessary to the port/patch infrastructure to
support the "update" mode instead of "remove+add".

Open tasks:

1.  Solve pending issues about the ports install/upgrade workflow,
    probably within the pkg_install2 effort.

  --------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contact: Zheng Liu <gnehzuil@gmail.com>

This project has two goals: pre-allocation algorithm for ext2fs and ext4
read-only mode. Aim of the pre-allocation algorithm is to implement a
reservation window mechanism. This mechanism has been implemented and a
patch have been submitted. The aim of ext4 read-only mode is to make it
possible to read ext4 file systems in read-only mode when the disk is
formatted with default features. Until now it can read data from ext4
file systems with default features in read-only mode. A patch has been
submitted a patch to the freebsd-fs mailing list and there is a new
kernel module, called ext4fs, is under development for it.

Open tasks:

1.  More testing of the pre-allocation algorithm.

Ringmap is a complete FreeBSD packet capturing stack specialized for
very high-speed networks. The goal of this project is to develop the
software for efficient packet capturing and integrate it with the
generic network drivers and libpcap.

Current Status:

-   Integrated with the lem driver. Intel network controllers: 8254X are
    supported.
-   Packet filtering using BPF in both kernel and user space.
-   Partly integrated with ixgbe driver for 10Gb capturing.

Open tasks:

1.  Support for hardware timestamping.
2.  Writing packets to the disc from within the kernel.
3.  Multiqueue support.
4.  Extending the "ringmap" for packet transmission.

kernel, userland tools and libc modifications are ready, documentation
is ready.

Open tasks:

1.  Documentation review.
2.  Presentation of feature set on the various mailing lists.
3.  Committing to -CURRENT, possibly merging to stable branches (changes
    do not break ABI/KBI).

BSD# Project

  The BSD# project on Google-code                 URL: http://code.google.com/p/bsd-sharp/
  Mono (Open source .Net Development Framework)   URL: http://www.mono-project.org/
  ----------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------

Contact: Romain Tartière <romain@FreeBSD.org>

The BSD# Project is devoted to porting the Mono .NET framework and
applications to the FreeBSD operating system.

Mono 2.8 has been released a few days ago and is already available in
the BSD# repository. The update breaks a few ports so the lang/mono
update in the FreeBSD ports tree will be delayed until those programs
are fixed for a smoother update experience.

Work is in progress to include some long-awaited ports such as
deskutils/gnome-do but they require a lot of testing and hacking because
they have clearly been designed to run on GNU/Linux and portability has
never been a priority (which is quite amusing if you consider
portability is the main reason to be for mono).

Open tasks:

1.  If you have some time, test mono ports and send feedback.
2.  If you have more time, join the BSD# Team! There are many ways to
    help out!
3.  Currently low priority, some mono hackers who do not use FreeBSD
    would be interested in a debug live-image of FreeBSD to help us
    diagnose and fix bugs more effectively.

During the previous few months several additions were developed to
FreeBSD's built-in SNMP daemon — bsnmpd(1).

First a snmp_wlan(3) module was developed that allows monitoring and
configuration of wlan(4) interfaces operating in various modes,
including statistics, attached/neighboring station information, MAC
access control entries and mesh routing information. The module's code
was submitted in SVN and is now a part of the FreeBSD base system.

Next, SNMPv3 authentication and encryption support were added to
bsnmplib(3), bsnmpd(1) and bsnmptools (which are available via the ports
system currently). The message digest and cipher calculation calls use
the implementation of the relevant cryptographic algorithm
implementation in OpenSSL's crypto(3) library. bsnmpd(1) may still
optionally be compiled without the crypto(3) library, in which case only
unauthenticated plain-text SNMPv3 PDUs may be processed.

In addition, a snmp_usm(3) module was developed that is used to
configure SNMPv3 users parameters (name, authentication & encryption
algorithms used and relevant keys, etc.) into bsnmpd(1) as per RFC 3414.

Finally, a snmp_vacm(3) module was developed that allows configuration
of view-based access control as per RFC 3415, and relevant checks are
made by bsnmpd(1) that allow or restrict access to specific
SNMPv1/SNMPv2 communities or SNMPv3 users to certain MIB subtrees as per
the configuration in the snmp_vacm(3) module. If none of the
SNMPv3-related modules is loaded, bsnmpd(1) preserves its current
behavior with SNMPv1/SNMPv2c PDUs.

This work is being funded by the FreeBSD Foundation.

Open tasks:

1.  Update Wiki Page to reflect latest work and document proper use.
2.  Finish cleanup and have it reviewed.
3.  More extensive user testing.

Capsicum is a lightweight OS capability and sandbox framework developed
at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory, supported by a grant
from Google. Capsicum extends the POSIX API, providing several new OS
primitives to support object-capability security on UNIX-like operating
systems: capabilities, a new sandboxed capability mode for processes,
anonymous shared memory objects, process descriptors, and a modified C
runtime able to support distributed applications within sandboxes.
Capsicum has been prototyped on FreeBSD -CURRENT, with a 8-STABLE
backport.

Capsicum is intended to supplement existing system-centric mandatory
access control protections by providing an application-centric
protection model, which better supports compartmentalised user programs
that set up one (or many) sandboxes to process untrustworthy data in. A
number of applications, from tcpdump to the Chromium web browser, have
been modified to use sandboxing to confine risky activities such as the
parsing of untrusted packets and HTML/JavaScript rendering.

We plan to begin merging the core Capsicum kernel features to FreeBSD
-CURRENT in November/December 2010 once a number of known problems have
been resolved. Following a KBI analysis, we will consider merging our
8-STABLE backport to Subversion. For the time being, and while APIs
stabilise, we plan to distribute the Capsicum libraries via ports.
However, simply having the kernel features in place is sufficient to
support sandboxing in tcpdump and Chromium.

The Capsicum paper by Robert Watson / Jonathan Anderson (Cambridge) and
Ben Laurie / Kris Kennaway (Google) won a best paper award at the 2010
USENIX Security Symposium!

Open tasks:

1.  More aggressively test (and as needed, fix) possible UNIX domain
    socket garbage collector interactions with Capsicum.
2.  Using results of our recent model checking analysis of the namei()
    sandboxing approach, make robustness improvements.
3.  Merge to FreeBSD -CURRENT in November/December.
4.  KBI analysis for possible 8-STABLE merge.
5.  Convert more applications to use Capsicum sandboxing!

Clang Replacing GCC in the Base System

Contact: Pawel Worach <pawel.worach@gmail.com>
Contact: Dimitry Andric <dim@FreeBSD.org>

We recently imported the 2.8 release of Clang into -CURRENT. This
release contains many new features and improvements. The integrated
assembler ships with this version, but it is not ready for general use
yet.

Since r212979, all necessary changes have been committed to be able to
build world with Clang, at least on amd64 and i386. It can also be
installed and run, and we are now starting the process of shaking out
the inevitable bugs.

Because LLVM and Clang are still being improved continuously, we want to
import new versions regularly, approximately every two months, to gain
access to new features, bug fixes and performance improvements.

There is also an effort on behalf of the ports people, to make as many
ports as possible compile and run properly with Clang. Most of the time,
this means fixing the incorrect assumption that gcc is the only existing
compiler, but sometimes more complicated issues pop up. Help in this
area is greatly appreciated.

Open tasks:

1.  Importing new Clang snapshots fairly regularly (approximately
    bi-monthly).
2.  Seeing if Clang can be used to build world for ARM (volunteers and
    ARM experts wanted).
3.  Fixing as many ports as possible to build with Clang.
4.  Running periodical ports exp builds with Clang (on amd64 and i386),
    for example once a month.

  ---------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contact: Max Khon <fjoe@samodelkin.net>

The purpose of DAHDI/FreeBSD project is to make it possible to use
FreeBSD as a base system for software PBX solutions.

DAHDI (Digium/Asterisk Hardware Device Interface) is an open-source
device driver framework and a set of hardware drivers for E1/T1, ISDN
digital, and FXO/FXS analog cards [1]. Asterisk is one of the most
popular open-source software PBX solutions [2].

The project includes porting DAHDI framework and hardware drivers for
E1/T1, FXO/FXS analog, and ISDN digital cards to FreeBSD. This also
includes TDMoE support, software and hardware echo cancellation
(Octasic, VPMADT032), and hardware transcoding support (TC400B). The
work is ongoing in the official DAHDI SVN repository with the close
collaboration with DAHDI folks at Digium.

DAHDI/FreeBSD project is completed. ports/misc/dahdi now contains the
most recent DAHDI/FreeBSD version and additional stuff that is not
available in DAHDI/FreeBSD SVN repository due to licensing and copyright
restrictions (OSLEC echo canceler, experimental zaphfc driver).
Experimental sparc64 support is also implemented and is currently being
tested.

There is a pile of minor changes in queue that will be handled soon:

-   Add ability to run asterisk+dahdi under non-root user account.
-   Add support for bri_net_ptmp ISDN signalling to asterisk port and
    drop old and outdated zaptel+asterisk-bristuff ports.

Periodic merges from DAHDI/Linux SVN will be continued on a regular
basis with rolling out new DAHDI/FreeBSD releases (most likely
synchronized with DAHDI/Linux releases).

External Toolchain Support

Contact: Warner Losh <imp@FreeBSD.org>

One problem that the project has with its push towards embedded
platforms is with the toolchain. The compilers and linkers and such in
the current FreeBSD support the architectures generically, but often
times silicon vendors produce specialized toolchains to wring the most
performance out of their silicon. Right now, it is difficult to compile
FreeBSD with these tools, as many manual steps are required to make
things 'just so'.

The external toolchain project will leverage some of the work done by
the Clang team to support Clang in the base system (breaking the strict
dependency on CC=cc (except for the broken intel CC support)). In
addition, the orchestration of the build (make buildworld) will change
to avoid bootstrapping certain tools, or compiling the compilers at all.
In addition, support for using alternate assemblers, linkers, etc., will
be added. The work will be done in subversion in projects/xtc (for
eXternal Tool Chain).

GELI Additions

Contact: Pawel Jakub Dawidek <pjd@FreeBSD.org>

There are three new GELI (a disk encryption GEOM class) features
available in -CURRENT:

-   AES-XTS encryption. XTS mode is a standard that is recommended these
    days for storage encryption. This is the default now. AES-XTS
    support was also added to opencrypto framework and aesni(4) driver.
-   Multiple encryption keys. GELI will use one encryption key for at
    most 2^20 blocks (sectors), as it is not recommended to use the same
    encryption key for too much data. It generates a key array from the
    master key on attach and uses it accordingly. This is the default
    now.
-   Passphrase can now also be loaded from a file (-J and -j options).

The gptboot now fully follows GPT specification (verifies checksums and
falls back to backup header and table if primary is corrupted).

One can now use new attributes to configure partition that gptboot will
try to boot only once from and in case of a failure it will fall back to
the previous one.

HAST (Highly Available Storage) Improvements

Contact: Pawel Jakub Dawidek <pjd@FreeBSD.org>

HAST is now better than ever! Some recent improvements include:

-   Hooks supports — HAST will execute the given command on various
    events (connect, disconnect, synchronization start, synchronization
    completed, synchronization interrupted, split-brain condition, role
    change).
-   Configuration reload on SIGHUP, a very missing functionality.
-   Internal keepalive mechanism.
-   Many bug fixes, majority of them reported by Mikolaj Golub.

Contact: Gleb Kurtsou <gk@FreeBSD.org>

PEFS is a kernel level stacked cryptographic file system, i.e. it stacks
on top of existing mounted filesystems. AES and Camellia algorithms in
XTS mode are supported. The project has matured since Summer of Code
2009, most important improvements for last few months include: switch to
use XTS encryption mode, implementation of sparse file support, fixing
rename bugs including race and livelock conditions, addition of ext2
support. PEFS suite contains pam module facilitating user authentication
with file system key and adding keys to mounted file system on login.
PEFS passes fsx, pjdfstest, blogbench and dbench tests running on top of
UFS and ZFS.

1.  The automated/scripted install features of pc-sysinstall need wider
    testing and use to expose potential weaknesses, bugs, and additional
    features it may require.
2.  Related tasks include getting a text front-end to pc-sysinstall
    working and hooking up pc-sysinstall to the build so install media
    is generated that runs pc-sysinstall.

Target Big Endian Must Die

Contact: Warner Losh <imp@FreeBSD.org>

The "tbemd" or Target Big Endian Must Die effort is nearing completion.
Most of the big sweeping changes to the tree have been committed. The
last change, actually pulling the switch, is stalled waiting for make
universe improvements. This work will change the TARGET_ARCH from a
plain 'mips' to 'mipsel' or 'mipseb' based on which endian the platform
has. It introduces the concept of multiple architectures being
implemented with one set of files, and regularizes that design pattern
into the FreeBSD build process. In the past, you had to set
TARGET_BIG_ENDIAN=t to compile for big endian, but that had a number of
problems: can not share /usr/obj between little and big endian targets,
sometimes the produced compilers will not work right unless
TARGET_BIG_ENDIAN is defined in the environment, etc.

Open tasks:

1.  Update make universe to cope with the new architectures when
    building kernels.

userland DTracing functionality to FreeBSD as it is available on
OpenSolaris. FreeBSD now supports the pid provider and the usdt probes.
plockstat is available with a separate patch. Dtruss, a DTrace script
that works similarly to ktrace, but with other advantages was imported
into FreeBSD. The mysql-server and postgresql-server ports also have
DTrace support.

Contact: Mark Linimon <linimon@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Remko Lodder <remko@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Volker Werth <vwe@FreeBSD.org>

The bugbusting team continue work on trying to make the contents of the
GNATS PR database cleaner, more accessible and easier for committers to
find and resolve PRs, by tagging PRs to indicate the areas involved, and
by ensuring that there is sufficient info within each PR to resolve each
issue.

July saw the addition of Alexander Best (arundel@) to this bugbusting
team, he is helping with the triaging PRs as they come in, creating
patches for problems and working with submitters to get the solutions
tested, and working through the PR backlog.

Also in July, Gavin Atkinson worked with Hans Petter Selasky on the USB
PRs, attempting to go through many of them and determine the status of
each of them. As a result, nearly 10% of the USB PRs were determined to
be closeable, with many more either being marked as patched already or
able to be committed quickly. Several PRs that only affect the old
(pre-8.0) USB stack were also identified and marked as such. More work
will take place in this area in the future.

August saw us host another bugathon, with an aim of investigating and
getting into a committable state several of the PRs with patches.
Turnout was not as great as in the past — mainly believed to be due to
the short notice, but still several PRs were progressed, with several
commits made and several PRs closed.

The number of PRs has held steady over the last three months, with
improvements in numbers in some categories (especially usb and bin)
being offset by slight increases in others.

Reports continue to be produced from the PR database, all of which can
be found from the links above. Committers interested in custom reports
are encouraged to discuss requirements with bugmeister@ — we are happy
to create new reports where needs are identified.

As always, anybody interested in helping out with the PR queue is
welcome to join us in #freebsd-bugbusters on EFnet. We are always
looking for additional help, whether your interests lie in triaging
incoming PRs, generating patches to resolve existing problems, or simply
helping with the database housekeeping (identifying duplicate PRs, ones
that have already been resolved, etc). This is a great way of getting
more involved with FreeBSD!

Open tasks:

1.  Try to find ways to get more committers helping us with closing PRs
    that the team has already analyzed.
2.  Try to get more non-committers involved with the triaging of PRs as
    they come in, and generating patches to fix reported problems.

Work has commenced on a newly funded FreeBSD Foundation project to bring
six modular TCP congestion control (CC) algorithm implementations (the
existing NewReno and five new algorithms: HTCP, CUBIC, Vegas, HD and
CHD) to the FreeBSD kernel. See the CAIA 5cc and NewTCP websites for
more details on the algorithms.

To support the project's primary deliverable, we will also be
incorporating the CAIA modular CC and Khelp frameworks into the FreeBSD
kernel, along with the Enhanced Round Trip Time Khelp module.

The project will make a sizable, state-of-the-art contribution to
FreeBSD and in certain areas, add completely novel work unavailable in
any other operating system known to us.

We anticipate a number of benefits, including vastly improved researcher
friendliness, reduced work for TCP oriented vendors of FreeBSD-based
appliances, and greater choice for system administrators who operate
FreeBSD systems in atypical network scenarios.

Keep an eye on the freebsd-net mailing list for project-related
announcements.

  -------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contact: Ermal Luçi <eri@FreeBSD.org>

This work is based on OpenBSD 4.5 state of pf(4). It includes many
improvements over the code currently present in FreeBSD. The actual new
feature present in pf45 repository is support for divert(4), which
should allow tools like snort_inline to work with pf(4) too. This work
also enables pfsync(4) to be loaded as a module as well.

Currently, this work is considered stable and a patch against -CURRENT
has been released on freebsd-pf mailing list.

The reason why this work is based off of OpenBSD 4.5 is that after this
release they have changed the syntax which is not backwards compatible.

After importing this one the work will go on the newest version and
decisions on it will then be done.

Open tasks:

1.  Make a decision whether we need pflow(4) in base.
2.  More regression testing is needed.

  ------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contact: Alexander Motin <mav@FreeBSD.org>

Work on new event timers infrastructure continues. In -CURRENT amd64,
arm (Marvell), i386, mips, pc98, powerpc, sparc64, sun4v architectures
were refactored to use new timers API.

New machine-independent timers management code was written. It can
utilize both legacy periodic and new one-shot timer operation modes.

Using one-shot mode allows to significantly reduce the number of timer
interrupts and respectively increase CPU sleep time during idle periods.
Timer interrupts on idle CPUs are now generated only when they are
needed to handle registered time-based events. Busy CPUs unluckily still
receive the full interrupt rate for purposes of resource accounting,
scheduling and timekeeping.

With some additional tuning it is now possible to have an 8-core system,
receiving only about 100 interrupts per second and respectively have CPU
idle periods up to 100ms. This allows to effectively use any supported
CPU idle states (C-states), that reduces power consumption and increases
effect of the Intel TurboBoost technology.

New manual pages were written to document this functionality:
eventtimers(7), attimer(4), atrtc(4), hpet(4).

Open tasks:

1.  Troubleshoot possible hardware issues.
2.  Refactor remaining architectures (arm, ia64, XEN PV).
3.  Do some optimizations in different subsystems to reduce number of
    time-based events. Extend callout API with terms of precision,
    allowing to group close events.
4.  Make schedulers tickless, or at least less depending on time events
    to make skipping timer interrupts possible when CPUs are busy.
5.  Merge code into 8-STABLE when it is considered ready.

Netdump provides kernel core dumping over the network, instead of to a
local disk. It implements a very minimal TCP/IPv4 stack and uses a
custom UDP protocol to transmit the dump to the netdump server running
on another host. Network interfaces selected for dumping perform I/O in
polling mode.

Netdump should find its use in diskless workstation clusters, PXE-booted
test machines, and perhaps when doing disk driver development.

Open tasks:

1.  General FreeBSD dumping mechanism refinements.
2.  Implement checksum on UDP packets.
3.  Investigate the possibility to replace the custom protocol with
    tftp.
4.  Investigate the possibility to replace the custom TCP/IPv4 stack
    with Contiki.
5.  Implement network console and gdb backend using a shared debug
    context stack.
6.  Add IPv6 support.

Resource Containers

Contact: Edward Tomasz Napierala <trasz@FreeBSD.org>

The goal of this project is to implement resource containers and a
simple per-jail resource limits mechanism. Resource containers are also
a prerequisite for other resource management mechanisms, such as
Hierarchical Resource Limits, for "Collective Limits on Set of Processes
(aka. Jobs)" Google Summer of Code 2010 project, for implementing
mechanism similar to Linux cgroups, and might be also used to e.g.
provide precise resource usage accounting for administrative or billing
purposes. So far, a generic resource usage framework has been developed,
along with limit enforcement for most resources. Work is on-going on
adding limits for remaining resources, debugging and generally improving
the implementation. This project is being sponsored by The FreeBSD
Foundation.

Kristaps' groff-replacement (only for rendering manual pages) is already
available in NetBSD and OpenBSD, and used to render the base system
manpages for the latter. This project aims to do similar things for
FreeBSD.

mandoc(1) is more strict in what it accepts as input and is still
lacking some features that are used by some selected few manpages.

Getting manual page fixes accepted by upstream vendors has been
challenging. Waiting for them to round-trip back into FreeBSD will take
even longer. Future work will therefore result in direct commits to our
contrib/ and gnu/ repository areas, in the hope this will not impact
future vendor imports too much.

Open tasks:

1.  Finish the Big Manpage Cleanup of 2010.
2.  Write a textproc/groff port for the latest groff version.
3.  Import mandoc(1), switch to catpages for base.
4.  Supply necessary ports infrastructure to opt-in to mandoc(1).
5.  Discuss future of groff(1) in base wrt. share/doc.

FreeBSD Services Control (fsc)

  ------- ----------------------------------------------

          URL: http://people.FreeBSD.org/~trhodes/fsc/
  ------- ----------------------------------------------

Contact: Tom Rhodes <trhodes@FreeBSD.org>

FreeBSD Services Control is a mix of binaries which integrate into the
rc.d system and provide for service (daemon) monitoring. It knows about
signals, pidfiles, and uses very little resources.

The fsc daemon (fscd) runs in the background once the system has
started. Services are then added to this daemon via the fscadm control
utility and from there they will be monitored. When they die, depending
on the reason, they will be restarted. Certain signals may be ignored
(list not decided), and fscd will remove that service from monitoring.
Every action is logged to the system logging daemon. Additionally, the
fscadm utility may be used to inquire about what services are monitored,
their pidfile location, and current process id.

FSC provides several advantages over the third-party daemontools
package. For example, fscd uses push notifications instead of polling;
fscd is an internal, FreeBSD-maintained software package accessible to
all developers where daemontools would have to be a port and require us
to maintain patches; fscd could be easily integrated with the current
rc.d infrastructure.

Partially based on the ideas of daemontools and Solaris Service
Management Facility (SMF), this could be an extremely useful tool for
FreeBSD systems.

Since the last status report, two bugs have been fixed and the
documentation has been updated. In the coming weeks we hope to get more
developer attention and review, perhaps even push to commit the code
into FreeBSD.

Open tasks:

1.  Testing and feedback would be really helpful.

Updating Base Tools to Accommodate Ports Requirements

Contact: Gordon Tetlow <gordon@FreeBSD.org>

The goal of the project is to allow easier extension of base system
tools by the ports system. Ideally, no files in /etc should need to be
modified by a port installation.

The man toolset was recently reimplemented as a BSDL version instead of
the old GPL version. It is also a single shell script instead of
multiple C programs. Ports can extend the man functionality by dropping
files into /usr/local/etc/man.d/portname.conf.

Next up on the list is to finish the implementation for newsyslog
thereby allowing ports that need logs rotated to take advantage of that
tool.

Packages with the .txz suffix can be created and installed. Log file
compression using xz in newsyslog(8) will be integrated soon. Benchmarks
show 15-30% better compression ratios and up to halved decompression
times when compared to bzip2. A switch from the default package format
from .tbz to .txz is to be considered.

FreeBSD/powerpc64 now boots multi-user SMP and is self-hosting on the
Playstation 3. Booting requires a PS3 console with the OtherOS
capability (fat model console with firmware < 3.21). The only supported
hardware at present is USB and the Ethernet controller.

Open tasks:

1.  SATA support.
2.  Boot loader enhancements to allow user input at the loader prompt.
3.  Support for the Cell SPU units.

  Links   
          URL: http://wiki.FreeBSD.org/FreeBSD/mips/Octeon
  ------- --------------------------------------------------

Contact: Juli Mallett <jmallett@FreeBSD.org>

All Octeon development is now ongoing in -CURRENT and most
Octeon-specific and general MIPS changes from the old Octeon branch have
been checked in. The Simple Executive from the Cavium Octeon SDK has
been checked into Subversion and most of the Octeon port has been
updated to use it where appropriate, including moving to a port of the
Linux Ethernet driver, octe. SMP support is stable on 2-core systems and
has seen some testing on systems with up to 16 cores.

Open tasks:

1.  Some PCI devices still do not seem to work completely.
2.  Host-mode USB support is incomplete and needs further testing and
    debugging.
3.  Work on an ATA-based Compact Flash driver for boards that support
    DMA has begun.
4.  A GPIO driver should be trivial using the Simple Executive.
5.  Performance in the Linux-derived octe Ethernet driver could be
    improved. Support for some switch chipsets that are commonly present
    in Octeon-based equipment is in progress.

FreeBSD/sparc64

Contact: Marius Strobl <marius@FreeBSD.org>

Apart from the constant bug fixing and adaptions to machine-independent
changes that pretty much always take place, not much has happened in the
area of sparc64 since the last status report. The only noteworthy
exception are some performance optimizations which take advantage of
features of Fujitsu SPARC64 CPUs. These were a bit too risky for putting
them in shortly before FreeBSD 8.1-RELEASE but will be part of
7.4-RELEASE and 8.2-RELEASE now that they have received the necessary
testing.

Part of reasons why not much has happened in this spot was some lack of
time on my side but also due to nobody showing up with a not yet
supported sun4u machine lately and me delving in the network land
instead, which yielded some things to report about in the next status
report. On the other hand I recently got a hold of a Sun Fire 3800, so
these and other models from the same family likely will be supported by
FreeBSD at some point in the future.

Contact: Ruben <chromium@hybridsource.org>

Chromium is a Webkit-based web browser that is largely BSD licensed and
was recently committed to ports. It has been working well on FreeBSD and
supports new features like HTML 5 video. Newer builds use the Clang
compiler, Clang first compiled a non-debug build of Chromium, a very
large C++ project, on FreeBSD. This porting effort employs a new
hybrid-source model: portions of the latest FreeBSD patches are kept
closed for a limited time and new builds are made available only to
paying subscribers, while older builds are eventually spun off to ports.
Further work remains to port all of Chromium to FreeBSD, I am now
porting the task manager to use FreeBSD's libkvm and the ALSA audio
backend needs to be ported to OSS. There are other issues listed at the
porting summary, contact me if you would like to pitch in.

AFS is a distributed network file system that originated from the Andrew
Project at Carnegie-Mellon University; the OpenAFS client implementation
has not been particularly useful on FreeBSD since the FreeBSD 4.X
releases. The previous status report brought the OpenAFS client to a
useful form on -CURRENT, though with many rough edges. Only a couple of
those edges have been smoothed out during the past few months, as
developer time was scarce. A mismatch between file size and vmobject
size tracking was resolved (allowing executables to be run from AFS),
and our system call entry has been updated on -CURRENT and 8-STABLE to
match reality. Thanks to Kostik Belusov for both of those! The code is
useful enough that we plan to submit an openafs-devel port to the Ports
Collection in the coming cycle.

There are several known outstanding issues that are being worked on, but
detailed bug reports are welcome at port-freebsd@openafs.org.

Open tasks:

1.  Rework vnode locking for lookup operations to avoid an
    easily-triggered deadlock between two threads when one is looking up
    the parent directory.
2.  Update VFS locking to allow the use of disk-based client caches as
    well as memory-based caches.
3.  Track down races and deadlocks that appear under load.
4.  Integrate with the bsd.kmod.mk kernel-module build infrastructure.

pkg_upgrade was (to my knowledge) the first binary packages only update
tool for the FreeBSD ports. Using it does not require a copy of the
ports tree.

Currently the tool is in the final stages of a recode, that will greatly
improve support for sharing packages over NFS or nullfs mounts (e.g. for
distributing packages into jails) and also offers improved dependency
tracking and performance, more in line with how pointyhat and Tinderbox
build packages.

I recently had the opportunity to present my work at the
EuroBSDCon 2010.

Open tasks:

1.  Complete session code.
2.  Add INDEX generator script that harvests information directly from
    packages and hence is always accurate.
3.  Testing.

The ports tree count now exceeds 22,000. With the assistance of many
people, especially Philip Gollucci, the open PR count is below 1000 for
the first time in quite a while. This is very encouraging progress.

Since the last report, we added five new committers, and took in two
commit bits for safe keeping.

With onsite assistance from jhb@, gnn@, skreuzer@, and pgollucci@, we
now have 11 new servers at NYI. The machines still need testing for
stability and will soon be assigned for package building.

The Ports Management team have been running -exp runs on an on-going
basis, verifying how base system updates may affect the ports tree, as
well as providing QA runs for major ports updates. Of note, -exp runs
were done for:

-   des: test libfetch
-   gabor: tests for BSD iconv and grep
-   mezz: switch www/neon28 to www/neon29
-   beat: update www/libxul
-   johans: update devel/bison and devel/m4
-   dinoex: update graphics/tiff
-   jpaetzel: update devel/popt
-   ade: multiple runs autotools upgrade
-   gerald: setting USE_GCC=4.5 as default
-   ashish: changes to Mk/bsd.license.mk
-   kwm: test of Clang in -CURRENT

Open tasks:

1.  Looking for help fixing ports broken on -CURRENT.
2.  Looking for help with Tier-2 architectures.
3.  Most ports PRs are assigned, we now need to focus on testing,
    committing and closing.

port has now been updated.

Development of the Valgrind port has moved from Perforce to
bitbucket.org, in order to make it easier for others to track changes as
we progress towards getting the port into shape to commit upstream. The
repository's Bitbucket address is at the beginning of the report.

A bugzilla entry has been submitted to track the FreeBSD Valgrind port.
You can see the status and vote for the bug to express your interest at
https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=208531.

Open tasks:

1.  Port exp-ptrcheck valgrind tool and fix outstanding issues that show
    up in memcheck/helgrind/DRD in the Valgrind regression tests suite.
2.  More testing (please, help).
3.  Integrate our patches upstream.

Work is progressing quickly on a major re-factoring of PC-BSD tools and
the PBI format for 9.0. Our GUI tools have been converted to compile /
run within native QT without KDE now, allowing us to begin offering
support for other desktop environments for 9.0, such as Gnome, XFCE,
LXDE, KDE, etc. The PBI format has undergone a complete evolution, and
is now entirely command-line based for all aspects of it, with only a
few dependencies upon curl & xdg-utils. This will allow us to begin
offering PBIs for traditional FreeBSD users starting with 9.0, who will
be able to install the pbi-manager from ports in the near future.

Open tasks:

1.  We are still busy converting / fixing all our tools to play nicely
    with various DE's, but making quick progress.
2.  The new PBI format is still undergoing extensive testing, and bugs
    are being isolated and fixed.
