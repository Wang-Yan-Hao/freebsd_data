The FreeBSD Office team works on a number of office-related software
suites and tools such as OpenOffice and LibreOffice.

Work during this quarter was focused on providing the latest stable
release of LibreOffice suite and companion apps to all FreeBSD users.

During the 2022Q1 period we pushed maintenance patches for the
LibreOffice 7.2 port to the quarterly branch and brought the latest,
7.3, releases and all companion libraries such as MDDS, libIxion and
more to the ports tree.

Also we are still working on the Boost WIP repository to bring the
latest Boost library to the ports.

We are looking for people to help with the open tasks:

-   The open bugs list contains all filed issues which need some
    attention

-   Upstream local patches in ports

Patches, comments and objections are always welcome in the mailing list
and Bugzilla.
