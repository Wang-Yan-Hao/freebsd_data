Wifibox: Use Linux to drive your wireless card on FreeBSD

Contact: PÁLI Gábor János <pali.gabor@gmail.com>

Wifibox is an experimental project for exploring the ways of deploying a
virtualized Linux guest to drive wireless networking cards on the
FreeBSD host system. There have been guides on the Internet to suggest
the use of such techniques to improve the wireless networking
experience, of which Wifibox aims to implement as a single easy-to-use
software package.

-   bhyve(8) is utilized to run the embedded Linux system. This helps to
    achieve low resource footprint. It requires an x64 CPU with I/O MMU
    (AMD-Vi, Intel VT-d), ~150 MB physical memory, and some disk space
    available for the guest virtual disk image, which can be even ~30 MB
    only in certain cases. It works with FreeBSD 12 and later, some
    cards may require a recent 13-STABLE though.

-   The guest is constructed using Alpine Linux, a security-oriented,
    lightweight distribution based on musl libc and BusyBox.

-   Configuration files are shared with the host system. The guest uses
    wpa_supplicant(8) so it is possible to import the host’s
    wpa_supplicant.conf(8) file without any changes.

-   When configured, wpa_supplicant(8) control sockets could be exposed
    by the guest, which enables use of related utilities directly from
    the host, such as wpa_cli(8) or wpa_gui(8) from the
    net/wpa_supplicant_gui port/package.

-   Everything is shipped in a single package that can be easily
    installed and removed. This comes with an rc(8) system service that
    automatically launches the guest on boot and stops it on shutdown.

-   A workaround is supplied for laptops to support suspend/resume.

Wifibox has been mainly tested with Intel chipsets so far, and it has
shown great performance and stability. Therefore it might serve as an
interim solution until the Intel Wireless support becomes mature enough.
It was confirmed that Wifibox works with Atheros chipsets too, and
feedback is more than welcome about others. Support for Broadcom
chipsets is not yet complete, that is currently a work in progress.
