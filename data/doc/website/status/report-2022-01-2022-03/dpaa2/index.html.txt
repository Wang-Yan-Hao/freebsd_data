NXP DPAA2 support

Links
Development URL:
https://github.com/mcusim/freebsd-src/tree/lx2160acex7-dev/sys/dev/dpaa2

Contact: Dmitry Salychev <dsl@mcusim.org>

Some of the NXP SoCs (LX2160A, LS1088A) are shipped with DPAA2, the
second generation of the data path acceleration architecture. It allows
to dynamically configure and wire packet processing "objects" (like DPNI
for a network interface, DPMAC for media access controller, etc.)
together to form a network-on-a-chip.

Honeycomb LX2, as one of the powerful ARM64 boards from SolidRun, is
also built around NXP LX2160A and lacks on-board GbE support in FreeBSD.
These drivers are about to change it.

It’s still work in progress and a rough implementation of the drivers
for some DPAA2 objects is available at the moment. A new network
interface (dpni) can be used on Honeycomb for testing.

TODO:

-   Update dpaa2_mc_fdt driver for the Traverse Ten64 board

-   Review and fix DPAA2 resources allocation to support as many DPNIs
    as possible

-   Free driver resources properly

-   Implement CPU affinity for DPIOs and DPNIs

-   Implement cached memory-backed software portals

-   Profile and mitigate bottlenecks
