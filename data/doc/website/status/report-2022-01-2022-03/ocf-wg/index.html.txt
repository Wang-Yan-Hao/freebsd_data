Kernel Crypto changes to support WireGuard

Contact: John Baldwin <jhb@FreeBSD.org>

During the last quarter, I continued my work to improve the FreeBSD
WireGuard driver. On the FreeBSD side, I added support for the
XChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD cipher. I also added a dedicated API to support
[X]ChaCha20-Poly1035 on small, flat buffers. Finally, I added an API
wrapper for the curve25519 implementation from libsodium.

For the WireGuard driver, I wrote a series of patches which updates the
driver to use crypto APIs such as those mentioned above in place of
internal cipher implementations. The series also includes a fix to avoid
scheduling excessive crypto tasks as well as a few other small fixes.
This series is pending review.
