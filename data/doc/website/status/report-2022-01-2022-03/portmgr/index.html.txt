The Ports Management Team is responsible for overseeing the overall
direction of the Ports Tree, building packages, and personnel matters.
Below is what happened in the last quarter.

Before we start with the usual statistics, portmgr is happy to announce
it has successfully restarted its lurker program. The first two lurkers
are pizzamig@ and se@; they will learn about the inner workings of
portmgr and bring in new ideas.

Portmgr also started having bi-weekly meetings, some public results are:

-   restarting the lurker program

-   fixes to ports going backwards in version

-   dropping DragonFlyBSD version checks in bsd.port.mk

-   dropping deprecation notes from ports transitively using Python 2.7

Currently we have over 46,800 ports in the Ports Tree. There are
currently 2,700 open ports PRs of which 680 are unassigned. The last
quarter saw 9,403 commits to the main branch by 157 committers and 683
commits to the 2022Q1 branch by 63 committers. Compared to last quarter,
this means a slight drop in activity to the main branch and a slight
increase in the number of open PRs.

No new committers joined during the last quarter, portmgr took one
commit bit in for safekeeping because of a lack of recent commits.

The cluster administration team has provided portmgr with a third
aarch64 builder; it is being used for package builds.

Things that happened in git:

-   Two new USES were introduced:

    -   elfctl to change an ELF binary’s feature control note

    -   minizip to get the correct library dependency on minizip

-   Two keywords got removed:

    -   fcfontsdir (now handled by USES=fonts)

    -   glib-schemas, it has been replaced by a trigger

-   Default versions that changed:

    -   Lazarus switched to 2.2.0

    -   PHP switched to 8.0

-   Some upgrades to major ports:

    -   Chromium 100.0.4896.60

    -   Electron 13.6.9

    -   Firefox 99.0

    -   Firefox ESR 91.8.0

    -   Gnome 41

    -   KDE Frameworks 5.92.0

    -   KDE Plasma 5.24.4
