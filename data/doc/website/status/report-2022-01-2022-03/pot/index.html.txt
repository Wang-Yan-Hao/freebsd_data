Containers and FreeBSD: Pot, Potluck and Potman

Pot organization on github URL: https://github.com/bsdpot

Pot is a jail management tool that also supports orchestration through
Nomad.

As a result of production testing in a real-world cluster deployment,
pot and related projects received stability improvements for controlling
the pot lifecycle (i.e., pot prepare/start/stop).
Various attributes and commands have been developed to improve support
of nomad orchestration and batch jobs (e.g., change dns config during
clone, ability to disable tmpfs, new last-run-stats command). A new pot
release will follow soon.

Potluck aims to be to FreeBSD and pot what Dockerhub is to Linux and
Docker: a repository of pot flavours and complete container images for
usage with pot and in many cases nomad.

Many of the core images like Nomad, Consul and Vault that can be used to
build a private cloud and orchestration platform, but also e.g.
Prometheus or PostgreSQL Patroni, have reached a stable status over the
last quarter and are in production use now.

To make navigating the evolving pot ecosystem easier, most project
resources have been centralized in a dedicated github project:
https://github.com/bsdpot

There, we plan to release ansible playbooks that allow easily creating a
FreeBSD based orchestration environment from scratch based on all these
tools.

As always, feedback and patches are welcome.
