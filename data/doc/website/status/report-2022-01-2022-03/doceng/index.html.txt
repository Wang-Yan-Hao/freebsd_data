Documentation Engineering Team

Link: Documentation Engineering Team

Contact: FreeBSD Doceng Team <doceng@FreeBSD.org>

The doceng@ team is a body to handle some of the meta-project issues
associated with the FreeBSD Documentation Project; for more information,
see FreeBSD Doceng Team Charter.

No new documentation commit bit was granted during the last quarter, and
only one commit bit was safe kept.

Several tasks were completed related to the doc tree during the last
quarter:

-   Fix some issues in the translation workflow with PO files and
    Weblate related to the po4a program.

    More info here.

-   Update offline documentation (PDF and HTML).

    The old directory /doc is now on ftp-archive; it contains files
    prior to the Hugo/Asciidoctor migration.

-   Remove Google Analytics from documentation and website.

-   Add last modified information to the documentation and website
    pages.

-   Tag FreeBSD docset for 13.1-RELEASE.

-   Add the first Indonesian translation to the doc tree.

FreeBSD Translations on Weblate

Link: Translate FreeBSD on Weblate
Link: FreeBSD Weblate Instance

The translation workflow with Weblate is more mature at this point.
Several issues were fixed between PO files and po4a program.

We welcome everyone to try our Weblate instance to translate a few
documents.

The first Indonesian translation was added to the FreeBSD project. We
thank Azrael JD for the contribution, and we are looking forward to
seeing more Indonesian translations.
