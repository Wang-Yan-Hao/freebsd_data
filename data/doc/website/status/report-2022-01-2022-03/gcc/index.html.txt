lang/gcc* ports need some love and attention

GCC Project URL: https://gcc.gnu.org
GCC 11 release series URL: https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-11/

After about two decades of maintaining FreeBSD’s lang/gcc* ports, the
time came to hand over the baton and mostly step back. Alas the baton
essentially dropped to the floor, despite multiple calls for help.

Here are a few specific tasks looking for help:

-   Upgrade GCC_DEFAULT in Mk/bsd.default-versions.mk from 10 to 11,
    including fixing the (luckily minor) fall out of an -exp run:
    https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=258378

-   Three changes to work through with upstream GCC (requires src
    expertise, not ports):

    -   upstreaming lang/gcc11/patch-gets-no-more

    -   upstreaming lang/gcc11/patch-arm-unwind-cxx-support

    -   https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=256874

-   We have removed the unmaintained lang/gcc9-devel and
    lang/gcc10-devel ports, alas kept lang/gcc11-devel and
    lang/gcc12-devel which would be good to see if not weekly, then
    somewhat regular updates.
