What is fpart ?

Fpart is a filesystem partitioner. It helps you sort file trees and pack
them into bags ("partitions").

It uses FreeBSD’s fts(3) implementation (GNU/Linux builds can also use
it as an option), which makes it crawl filesystems very fast.

A hook facility is provided to trigger actions on the partitions
produced.

What is fpsync ?

Fpsync is a companion script that uses fpart under the hood to
parallelize rsync(1) or cpio(1) jobs, making it a simple but powerful
data migration tool. Those jobs can be run either locally or remotely
(using SSH). Fpsync is often used by researchers and cloud providers
where lots of data need to be moved and clusters are available to speed
up transfers.

Q1 2022 Status

Both tools continued to evolve and saw several bugs fixed; see the
changelog.

Also, a user reported a major bug regarding our fts(3) implementation,
which ignores readdir(3) errors. I have reported the bug in our
Bugzilla:

https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=262038

It should be merged soon (hopefully).

Last but not least, fpart has been referenced in the French Government’s
'SILL'.
