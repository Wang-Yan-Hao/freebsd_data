FreeBSD provides the Ports Collection to give users and administrators a
simple way to install applications. It is possible to configure a port
before the building and installation. PortConfig is an utility for
setting the port options via a Text User Interface.

As each terminal has different properties PortConfig can be customized
via environment variables to set up the User Interface, for example:
menu size, theme, borders, and so on; each feature is documented inside
the manual. Further, if a port has a specific 'pkg-help' file,
PortConfig will show a Help button to open a "popup" with help
information.

FreeBSD provides thousands of ports therefore it is not feasible to test
PortConfig for each use; please report any problem.

Alfonso would like to thank Baptiste Daroussin for the port,
suggestions, help, and testing for this utility and its library.
