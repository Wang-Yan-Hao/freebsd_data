Over the past several months, I’ve started putting together tools and
resources to help make the FreeBSD ecosystem (more) accessible to people
with disabilities:

-   a mailing list

-   a set of wiki pages including resources and a categorized wish list

-   tooling including a searchable accessibility Bugzilla keyword and an
    accessibility Phabricator group

I need all the help I can get with:

-   specifying, designing, implementing, and testing the items on the
    wishlist

-   adding to the wishlist in areas were have little or no experience or
    for things I missed

-   moving beyond software and documentation to processes and culture
