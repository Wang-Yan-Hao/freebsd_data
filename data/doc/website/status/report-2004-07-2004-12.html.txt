Introduction

The FreeBSD status report is back again after another small break. The
second half of 2004 was incredibly busy; FreeBSD 5.3 was released, the
6-CURRENT development branch started, and EuroBSDCon 2004 was a huge
success, just to name a few events. This report is packed with an
impressive 44 submissions, the most of any report ever!

It's also my pleasure to welcome Max Laier and Tom Rhodes to the status
report team. They kindly volunteered to help keep the reports on time
and help improve their quality. Max in particular is responsible for the
reports being divided up into topics for easier browsing. Many thanks to
both for their help!

Common Address Redundancy Protocol - CARP

  ------- ----------------------------------------------
  Links   
          URL: http://people.freebsd.org/~mlaier/CARP/
  ------- ----------------------------------------------

Contact: Max Laier <mlaier@FreeBSD.org>

CARP is an alternative to VRRP. In contrast to VRRP it has full support
for IPv6 and uses crypto to protect the advertisements. It was developed
by OpenBSD due to concerns that the HSRP patent might cover VRRP and
CISCO might defend its patent. CARP has, since then, improved a lot over
VRRP.

CARP is implemented as an in-kernel multicast protocol and displays
itself as a pseudo interface to the user. This makes configuration and
administration very simple. CARP also incorporates MAC based
load-balancing.

Patches for RELENG_5 and recent HEAD are available from the URL above. I
plan to import these patches in the course of the next two to four
month. RELENG_5 has all necessary ABI to support CARP and I might MFC it
for release 5.4 or 5.5 - depending how well the HEAD import goes.

Open tasks:

1.  Please test and send feedback!
2.  Write documentation.
3.  Import newest OpenBSD changes.

  ------------------------- ---------------------------------------

Contact: Tobias Roth <ports@fsck.ch>

FreeBSD profile.sh is targeted at laptops. It allows to define multiple
network environments (eg, home, work), and will then detect in which
environment the laptop is started and configure it accordingly. Almost
everything from under /etc can be configured per environment, and only
the overrides to the default /etc have to be defined. Suspending in one
environment and resuming in a different one is also supported.

Proper integration into the acpi/apm and several small improvements are
underway. More testing with different system configurations is needed.

Contact: Scott Long <re@FreeBSD.org>

At long last, FreeBSD 5.3 was released in November of 2004. This marked
the start of the RELENG_5/5-STABLE branch and the beginning of the
6-CURRENT development branch. Many thanks to the tireless efforts of the
FreeBSD developer and user community for making this release a success.

FreeBSD 4.11 release engineering is also now in progress. This will be
the final release from the 4.x series and is mainly incremental bug
fixes and a handful of feature additions. Of note is that the IBM
ServeRAID 'IPS' driver is now supported on 4.x and will be included in
this release, and the Linux emulation layer has been updated to support
a RedHat 8.0 userland. The release is expected to be available on
January 24.

Looking forward, there will be several FreeBSD 5.x releases in the
coming year. FreeBSD 5.4 release engineering will start in March, and
FreeBSD 5.5 release engineering will likely start in June. These
releases are expected to be more conservative than previous 5.x releases
and will follow the same philosophy as previous -STABLE branches of
fixing bugs and adding incremental improvements while maintaining API
stability.

For the 6-CURRENT development branch as well as all future development
and stable branches, we are planning to move to a schedule with fixed
timelines that move away from the uncertainty and wild schedule
fluctuations of the previous 5.x releases. This means that major
branches will happen at 18 month intervals, and releases from those
branches will happen at 4 month intervals. There will also be a
dedicated period of testing and bug fixing at the beginning of each
branch before the first release is cut from that branch. With the
shorter and more defined release schedules, we hope to lessen the
problem of needed features not reaching users in a reasonable time, as
happened too often with 5.x. This is a significant change in our
strategy, and we look forward to realizing the benefits of it. This will
kick off with the RELENG_6 branch happing in June of 2005, followed by
the 6.0 release in August of 2005.

Also on the roadmap is a plan to combine the live-iso disk2 and the
install distributions of disk1 into a single disk which can be used for
both installation and for recovery. 3rd party packages that currently
reside on disc1 will be moved to a disk2 that will be dedicated to these
packages. This move will allow us to deal with the ever growing size of
packages and also provide more flexibility to vendors that wish to add
their own packages to the releases. It also opens the door to more
advanced installers being put in place of sysinstall. Anyone interested
in helping with this is encouraged to contact us.

Contact: FreeSBIE Staff <staff@FreeSBIE.org>

FreeSBIE is a Live-CD based on the FreeBSD Operating system, or even
easier, a FreeBSD-based operating system that works directly from a CD,
without touching your hard drive.

On December, 6th, 2004, FreeSBIE Staff released FreeSBIE 1.1, based on
FreeBSD 5.3-RELEASE. Some of the innovations are: a renewed series of
scripts to support power users in the use of FreeSBIE 1.1, an installer
to let users install FreeSBIE 1.1 on their hard drives, thus having a
powerful operating system such as FreeBSD, but with all the
personalizations FreeSBIE 1.1 carries, the presence of the best open
source software, chosen and personalized, such as X.Org 6.7, XFCE
4.2RC1, Firefox 1.0 and Thunderbird 0.9.2.

For a complete list of the included software, please consult:
http://www.freesbie.org/doc/1.1/FreeSBIE-1.1-i386.pkg_info.txt

At EuroBSDCon 2004 in Karlsruhe, Germany, people from the FreeSBIE staff
gave a talk, deeping into FreeSBIE scripts implementation and use.

Improved Multibyte/Wide Character Support

Contact: Tim Robbins <tjr@FreeBSD.org>

Support for multibyte characters has been added to many more base system
utilities, including basename, col, colcrt, colrm, column, fmt, look,
nl, od, rev, sed, tr, and ul. As a result of changes to the C library
(see below), most utilities that perform regular expression matching or
pathname globbing now support multibyte characters in these aspects.

The regular expression matching and pathname globbing routines in the C
library have been improved and now recognize multibyte characters.
Various performance improvements have been made to the wide character
I/O functions. The obsolete 4.4BSD "rune" interface and UTF2 encoding
have been removed from the 6-CURRENT branch.

Work is progressing on implementations of the POSIX iconv and localedef
interfaces for potential inclusion into the FreeBSD 6.0 release.

Contact: Colin Percival <cperciva@FreeBSD.org>

In my continuing quest to secure the mechanisms by which FreeBSD users
keep their systems up to date, I've added a new tool: Portsnap.
Available as sysutils/portsnap in the ports tree, this utility securely
downloads and updates a compressed snapshot of the ports tree; this can
then be used to extract or update an uncompressed ports tree. In
addition to operating in an end-to-end secure manner thanks to RSA
signatures, portsnap operates entirely over HTTP and can use under one
tenth of the bandwidth of cvsup for users who update their ports tree
more than once a week.

FreeBSD Update -- my utility for secure and efficient binary tracking of
the Security/Errata branches -- continues to be widely used, with over
100 machines downloading security or errata updates daily.

At some point in the future I intend to bring both of these utilities
into the FreeBSD base system, probably starting with portsnap.

ATA Driver Status Report

Contact: Søren Schmidt <sos@FreeBSD.org>

The ATA driver is undergoing quite a few important changes, mainly it is
being converted into modules so it can be loaded/unloaded at will, and
just the pieces for wanted functionality need be present.

This calls for ata-raid to finally be rewritten. This is almost done for
reading metadata so arrays defined in the BIOS can be used, and its
grown quite a few new metadata formats. This also paves the way for
ataraid to finally be able to take advantage of some of the newer
controllers "RAID" abilities. However this needs more work to
materialize but now its finally possible

There is also support coming for a few new chipsets as usual.

The work is just about finished enough that it can be released as
patches to sort out eventual problems before hitting current. The
changes are pretty massive as this touches all over the driver
infrastructure, so lots of old bugs and has also been spotted and fixed
during this journey

CPU Cache Prefetching

  ------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  Links   
          URL: http://www.nrg4u.com/freebsd/tcp_reass+prefetch-20041216.patch
  ------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Contact: Andre Oppermann <andre@FreeBSD.org>

Modern CPU's can only perform to their maximum if their working code is
in fast L1-3 cache memory instead of the bulk main memory. All of
today's CPU's support certain L1-3 cache prefetching instructions which
cause data to be retrieved from main memory to the cache ahead of the
time that it is already in place when it is eventually accessed by the
CPU.

CPU Cache Prefetching however is not a golden bullet and has to be used
with extreme care and only in very specific places to be beneficial.
Incorrect usage can lead to massive cache pollution and a drop in
effective performance. Correct and very carefully usage on the other can
lead to drastic performance increases in common operations.

In the linked patch CPU cache prefetching has been used to prefetch the
packet header (OSI layer 2 to 4) into the CPU caches right after
entering into the network stack. This avoids a complete CPU stall on the
first access to the packet header because packets get DMA'd into main
memory and thus never are already pre-cache in the CPU caches. A second
use in the patch is in the TCP input code to prefetch the entire struct
tcpcb which is very large and used with a very high probability. Use in
both of these places show a very significant performance gain but not
yet fully quantified.

The final patch will include documentation and a guide to evaluate and
assess the use of CPU cache prefetch instructions in the kernel.

i386 Interrupt Code & PCI Interrupt Routing

Contact: John Baldwin <jhb@FreeBSD.org>

The ACPI PCI link support code was reworked to work around some
limitations in the previous implementation. The new version more closely
matches the current non-ACPI $PIR link support. Enhancements include
disabling unused link devices during boot and using a simpler and more
reliable algorithm for choosing ISA IRQs for unrouted link devices.

Support for using the local APIC timer to drive the kernel clocks
instead of the ISA timer and i8254 clock is currently being worked on in
the jhb_clock perforce branch. It is mostly complete and will probably
hit the tree in the near future. By letting each CPU use its own private
timer to drive the kernel clocks, the kernel no longer has to IPI all
the other CPUs in the system every time a clock interrupt occurs.

IPFW2 has been converted to use PFIL_HOOKS for the IP[46] in/output
path. (See link.) Not converted yet is the Layer 2 Etherfilter
functionality of IPFW2. It is still directly called from the
ether_input/output and bridging code.

Layer 2 PFIL_HOOKS provide a general abstraction for packet filters to
hook into the Layer 2 packet path and filter or manipulate such packets.
This makes it possible to use not only IPFW2 but also PF and others for
Layer 2 filtering.

Move ARP out of routing table

Contact: Qing Li <qingli@speackeasy.net>

The ARP IP address to MAC address mapping does not belong into the
routing table (FIB) as it is currently done. This will move it to its
own hash based structure which will be instantiated per each 802.1
broadcast domain. With this change it is possible to have more than one
interface in the same IP subnet and layer 2 broadcast domain. The ARP
handling and the routing table will be quite a bit simplified
afterwards. As an additional benefit full MAC address based accounting
will be provided.

Qing Li has become the driver and implementor of this project and is
expected to post a first patch for comments shortly in February 2005.

Network Stack Locking

Contact: Robert Watson <rwatson@FreeBSD.org>

The netperf project is working to enhance the performance of the FreeBSD
network stack. This work grew out of the SMPng Project, which moved the
FreeBSD kernel from a "Giant Lock" to more fine-grained locking and
multi-threading. SMPng offered both performance improvement and
degradation for the network stack, improving parallelism and preemption,
but substantially increasing per-packet processing costs. The netperf
project is primarily focused on further improving parallelism in network
processing while reducing the SMP synchronization overhead. This in turn
will lead to higher processing throughput and lower processing latency.
Tasks include completing the locking work, optimizing locking
strategies, amortizing locking costs, introducing new synchronization
primitives, adopting non-locking synchronization strategies, and
improving opportunities for parallelism through additional threading.

Between July, 2004, and December, 2004, the Netperf project did a great
deal of work, for which there is room only to include limited
information. Much more information is available by visiting the URLS
above, including information on a variety of on-going activities.
Accomplishments include:

implementation; locking for the if_xl driver; socket locking for the NFS
client; cleanup of the soreceive() code path including structural
improvements, assertions, and locking fixes; cleanup of the IPX/SPX code

New Modular Input Device Layer

  ------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Links   
          URL: http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/cvs-src/2004-November/035462.html
  ------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contact: Philip Paeps <philip@FreeBSD.org>

Following a number of mailing lists discussions on the topic, work has
been progressing on the development of a new modular input device layer
for FreeBSD. The purpose of this is twofold:

-   Easier development of new input device drivers.
-   Support for concurrent use of multiple input devices, particularly
    the hot-pluggable kind.

Currently, implementing support for new input devices is a painful
process and there is great potential for code-duplication. The new input
device layer will provide a simple API for developers to send events
from their hardware on to the higher regions of the kernel in a
consistent way, much like the 'input-core' driver in the Linux kernel.

Using multiple input devices at the moment is painful at best. With the
new input device layer, events from different devices will be properly
serialized before they are sent to other parts of the kernel. This will
allow one to easily use, for instance, multiple USB keyboards in a
virtual terminal.

The work on this is still in very rudimentary state. It is expected that
the first visible changes will be committed to -CURRENT around late
February or early March.

SMPng Status Report

  -------

Contact: John Baldwin <jhb@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: <smp@FreeBSD.org>

Lots of changes happened inside the network stack that will hopefully be
covered by a separate report. Outside of the network stack, several
changes were made however including changes to proc locking, making the
kernel thread scheduler preemptive, fixing several priority inversion
bugs in the scheduler, and a few performance tweaks in the mutex
implementation.

Locking work on struct proc and its various substructures continued with
locking added where needed for struct uprof, struct rusage, and struct
pstats. This also included reworking how the kernel stores process time
statistics to store the raw struct bintime and tick counts internally
and only compute the more user friendly values when requested via
getrusage() or wait4().

Support for kernel thread preemption was added to the scheduler.
Basically, when a thread makes another thread runnable, it may yield the
current CPU to the new thread if the new thread has a more important
priority. Previously, only interrupt threads preempted other threads and
the implementation would occasionally trigger spurious context switches.
This change exposed bugs in other parts of the kernel and was turned off
by default in RELENG_5. Currently, only the i386, amd64, and alpha
platforms support native preemption.

Several priority inversion bugs present in the scheduler due to various
changes to the kernel from SMPng were also fixed. Most of the credit for
these fixes belongs Stephan Uphoff who has recently been added as a new
committer. Fixes include: closing a race in the turnstile wakeup code,
changing the sleep queue code to store threads in FIFO order so that the
sleep queue wakeup code properly handles having a thread's priority
changes, and abstracting the concept of priority lending so that the
thread scheduler is now able to properly track priority inheritance and
handle priority changes for threads blocked on a turnstile.

Works in progress include separating critical sections from spin mutexes
some so that bare critical sections become very cheap as well as
continuing to change the various ABI compatibility layers to use
in-kernel versions of system calls to reduce stackgap usage and make the
system call wrappers MPSAFE.

sppp(4) was updated (in 6.current) to be able to work in mpsafe mode.
For compatibility if an interface is unable to work in mpsafe mode, sppp
will not use mpsafe locks.

Support of FrameRelay AnnexD was added as a historical commit. Many of
Cronyx users were expecting this commit for a long long time, and most
of them still prefer sppp vs netgraph because of simplicity of its
configuration (especially for ppp (vs mpd) and fr (vs a couple of
netgraph modules). After MFCing this I'll finally close a PR 21771, from

TCP Cleanup and Optimizations

Contact: Andre Oppermann <andre@FreeBSD.org>

The TCP code in FreeBSD has evolved significantly since the fork from
4.4BSD-Lite2 in 1994 primarily due to new features and refinements of
the TCP specifications.

The TCP code now needs a general overhaul, streamlining a cleanup to
make it easily comprehensible, maintainable and extensible again. In
addition there are many little optimizations that can be done during
such an operation propelling FreeBSD back at the top of the best
performing TCP/IP stacks again, a position it has held for the longest
time in the 90's.

This overhaul is a very involved and delicate matter and needs extensive
formal and actual testing to ensure no regressions compared to the
current code. The effort needed for this work is about two man-month of
fully focused and dedicated time. To get it done I need funding to take
time off my day job and to dedicate me to FreeBSD work much the way PHK
did with his buffer cache and vnode rework projects.

In February 2005 I will officially announce the funding request with a
detailed description of the work and how the funding works. In general I
can write invoices for companies wishing to sponsor this work on
expenses. Tax exempt donations can probably be arranged through the
FreeBSD foundation. Solicitations of money are already welcome, please
contact me on the email address above.

Open tasks:

1.  Funding for two man-month equivalents of my time.
2.  If you want or intend to sponsor US$1k or more please contact me in
    advance already now.

TCP Reassembly Rewrite and Optimization

Contact: Andre Oppermann <andre@FreeBSD.org>

Currently TCP segment reassembly is implemented as a linked list of
segments. With today's high bandwidth links and large bandwidth*delay
products this doesn't scale and perform well.

The rewrite optimizes a large number of operational aspects of the
segments reassembly process. For example it is very likely that the just
arrived segment attaches to the end of the reassembly queue, so we check
that first. Second we check if it is the missing segment or
alternatively attaches to the start of the reassembly queue. Third
consecutive segments are merged together (logically) and are skipped
over in one jump for linear searches instead of each segment at a time.

Further optimizations prototyped merge consecutive segments on the mbuf
level instead of only logically. This is expected to give another
significant performance gain. The new reassembly queue is tracking all
holes in the queue and it may be beneficial to integrate this with the
scratch pad of SACK in the future.

Andrew Gallatin was able to get 3.7Gb/sec TCP performance on dual-2Gbit
Myrinet cards with severe packet reordering (due to a firmware bug) with
the new TCP reassembly code. See second link.

TTCPv2: Transactional TCP version 2

  Links   
          URL: http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/cvs-all/2004-November/089939.html
  ------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contact: Andre Oppermann <andre@FreeBSD.org>

The old TTCP according to RFC1644 was insecure, intrusive, complicated
and has been removed from FreeBSD >= 5.3. Although the idea and
semantics behind it are still sound and valid.

The rewrite uses a much easier and more secure system with 24bit long
client and server cookies which are transported in the TCP options.
Client cookies protect against various kinds of blind injection attacks
and can be used as well to generally secure TCP sessions (for BGP for
example). Server cookies are only exchanged during the SYN-SYN/ACK phase
and allow a server to ensure that it has communicated with this
particular client before. The first connection is always performing a
3WHS and assigning a server cookie to a client. Subsequent connections
can send the cookie back to the server and short-cut the 3WHS to
SYN->OPEN on the server.

TTCPv2 is fully configurable per-socket via the setsockopt() system
call. Clients and server not capable of TTCPv2 remain fully compatible
and just continue using the normal 3WHS without any delay or other
complications.

Work on implementing TTCPv2 is done to 90% and expected to be available
by early February 2005. Writing the implementation specification (RFC
Draft) has just started.

We haven't produced a status report in a while, but that's just because
we've been busy. Since our last report in March 2004, we have added
three new team members: Koop Mast (kwm), Jeremy Messenger (mezz), and
Michael Johnson (ahze). Jeremy has been quite helpful in GNOME
development porting while Michael and Koop have been focusing on
improving GNOME multimedia, especially GStreamer. The stable release of
GNOME is now up to 2.8.2, and we are actively working on the GNOME 2.9
development branch with is slated to become 2.10 on March 9 of this
year.

The GNOME Tinderbox is still cranking away, and producing packages for
both the stable and development releases of GNOME for all supported i386
versions of FreeBSD.

Thanks to Michael Johnson, the FreeBSD GNOME team has recently been
given permission to use the Firefox and Thunderbird names , official
icons, and to produce officially branded builds. Mozilla has also been
very interested in merging our local patches back into the official
source tree. This should greatly improve the quality of Firefox and
Thunderbird on FreeBSD moving forward.

Finally, Adam Weinberger (adamw) has been pestering the team for photos
so that we can finally show the community who we are. It is still
unclear as to whether or not this will attract more FreeBSD GNOME users,
or land us on the Homeland Security no-fly list.

OpenOffice.org 2.0 status

-   OpenOffice.org 2.0 is planned to be released in March 2005.
    Currently developer snapshot versions are available. Now one of the
    developer version has been ported, and committed to ports tree
    (/usr/ports/editors/openoffice-2.0-devel).
-   Packages for 5.3-RELEASE are available at
    http://sourceforge.jp/projects/waooo/files/asOOo_1.9m71_FreeBSD53Intel_install_en-US.tbz
    etc., and soon it will also available at :
    http://ooomisc.services.openoffice.org/pub/OpenOffice.org/ooomisc/FreeBSD/
    with the language pack.
-   Almost all of the patches required to build will be integrated to
    master. http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=40187
-   Now we have three external ports : lang/gcc-ooo, devel/bison-devel
    and devel/epm. To avoid regressions and bugs of gcc, we use the
    exactly same gcc as Hamburg team (former StarDivision) uses. We need
    bison later than 1.785a. Note this port CONFLICTS with devel/bison.
    Epm is a package manager which now OpenOffice.org uses.

OpenOffice.org 1.1 status

-   1.1.4 has been ported and committed to ports tree.
-   Packages are available at
    http://ooomisc.services.openoffice.org/pub/OpenOffice.org/ooomisc/FreeBSD/
    .
-   Now recognizes Linux version of Java JDKs.

General

-   Invoking OpenOffice.org from command line has been changed. Now
    `.org' is mandatory. e.g. openoffice-1.1.4 -> openoffice.org-1.1.4.
    Since the name of the software is OpenOffice.org, not OpenOffice. We
    are also considering the name of the ports
    (/usr/ports/editors/openoffice-2.0-devel -> openoffice.org2-devel
    etc)
-   Now marked as BROKEN OOo ports for prior than 5.3-RELEASE and
    4.11-RELEASE. These ports have been suffering from a minor
    implementation difference of rtld.c between FreeBSD and Linux,
    Solaris, NetBSD. We have been applying a patch adding _end in
    mapfile. We need this since rtld depend on existence of _end symbol
    in obj_from_addr_end, unfortunately this seem to induce
    hard-to-solve errors. A great progress has been made kan, rtld now
    do not depend on _end. A fix was committed 2004/02/25 17:06:16,
    http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/libexec/rtld-elf/rtld.c.diff?r1=1.91&r2=1.92&f=h
    .
-   Benchmark test! Building OOo requires huge resources. We just would
    like to know the build timings, so that how your machine is well
    tuned for demanding jobs.
    http://porting.openoffice.org/freebsd/benchmark.html . Currently,
    GOTO daichi (daichi)'s Pentium 4 3.0GHz machine build fastest. Just
    1h25m22.42s for second build of OOo 1.1.4, using ccache.
-   SDK tutorial is available at
    http://porting.openoffice.org/freebsd/sdk.html
-   Still implementation test and quality assurance have not yet been
    done. Even systematic documentations are not yet available for
    FreeBSD. http://porting.openoffice.org/freebsd/testing.html and
    http://porting.openoffice.org/freebsd/QA.html for details.

Contact: Erwin Lansing <erwin@FreeBSD.org>

Since the last report on the Ports Collection, much has changed.
Organizationally, the portmgr team saw the departure of some of the
long-term members, and the addition of some newer members, Oliver
Eikemeier, Kirill Ponomarew and Mark Linimon. Later on, portmgr also had
to say goodbye to Will Andrews. In addition, we have gained quite a few
new ports committers during this time period, and their contributions
are quite welcome!

Most effort was devoted to two releases. The 5.3 release saw an
especially long freeze period, but due to the good shape of the ports
tree, the freeze for the 4.11 could be kept to a minimum. Several
iterations of new infrastructure changes were tested on the cluster and
committed. Also, the cluster now builds packages for 6-CURRENT,
increasing the total number of different build environment to 10.

Additionally, several sweeps through the ports tree were made to bring
more uniformity in variables used in the different ports and their
values, e.g. BROKEN , IGNORE , DEPRECATED , USE_GCC , and others.

In technical terms, the largest change was moving to the X.org codebase
as our default X11 implementation. At the same time, code was committed
to be able to select either the X.org code or the XFree86 code, which
also saw an update during that time. Due to some hard work by Eric
Anholt, new committer Dejan Lesjak, and Joe Marcus Clarke, all of this
happened more smoothly than could have reasonably been expected.

As well, GNOME and KDE saw updates during this time, as did Perl and the
Java framework. Further, there were some updates to the Porter's
Handbook, but more sections are still in need of updates to include
recent changes in practices. Also, during this time, Bill Fenner was
able to fix a bug in his distfile survey .

Shortly before the release for 4.11 our existing linux_base was marked
forbidden due to security issues. A lot of effort was spent to upgrade
the default version to 8 from 7 to ship 4.11 with a working linuxolator.

Due to stability problems in the April-May timeframe, the package builds
for the Alpha were dropped. After Ken Smith and others put some work
into the Alphas in the build cluster, package builds for 4.X were
reenabled late in 2004.

Ports QA reminders -- portmgr team members are now sending out periodic
email about problems in the Ports Collection. The current set includes:

-   a public list of all ports to be removed due to security problems,
    build failures, or general obsolescence, unless they are fixed first
-   private email to all maintainers of the affected ports (including
    ports dependent on the above)
-   private email to all maintainers of ports that are marked BROKEN
    and/or FORBIDDEN
-   private email to maintainers who aren't committers, who have PRs
    filed against their ports (to flag PRs that might never have been
    Cc:ed to them)
-   public email about port commits that break building of INDEX
-   public email about port commits that send the revision metadata
    backwards (and thus confuse tools like portupgrade)

The idea behind each of these reminders is to try to increase the
visibility of problems in the Ports Collection so that problems can be
fixed faster.

Finally, it should be noted that we passed yet another milestone and the
Ports Collection now contains over 12,000 ports.

Open tasks:

1.  The majority of our build errors are still due to compilation
    problems, primarily from the gcc upgrades. Thanks to the efforts of
    many volunteers, these are decreasing, but there is still much more
    work to be done.
2.  The next highest number of build errors are caused by code that does
    not build on our 64-bit architectures due to the assumption that
    "all the world's a PC." Here is the entire list ; the individual
    bars are clickable. This will become more and more important now
    that the amd64 port has been promoted to tier-1 status.
3.  A lot of progress has been meed to crack down on ports that install
    files outside the approved directories and/or do not de-install
    cleanly (see "Extra files not listed in PLIST" on pointyhat ) and
    this will remain a focus area.

Update of the Linux userland infrastructure

Contact: Alexander Leidinger <netchild@FreeBSD.org>

The default linux_base port port was changed from the RedHat 7 based
emulators/linux_base to the RedHat 8 based emulators/linux_base-8 just
in time for FreeBSD 4.11-Release because of a security problem in
emulators/linux_base. In the conversion process several problems where
fixed in some Linux ports.

Both RedHat 7 and 8 are at their end of life, so expect an update to a
more recent Linux distribution in the future. For QA reasons this update
wasn't scheduled before FreeBSD 4.11-Release.

ALTQ is part of FreeBSD 5.3 release and can be used to do traffic
shaping and classification with PF. In CURRENT IPFW gained the ability
to do ALTQ classification as well. A steadily increasing number of NIC
drivers has been converted to support ALTQ. For details see the ALTQ(4)
man-page.

Open tasks:

1.  Convert/test more NIC drivers.
2.  Write documentation.

Cronyx Adapters Drivers

  Cronyx Software download page.   URL: http://www.cronyx.ru/software

Contact: Roman Kurakin <rik@FreeBSD.org>

Currently FreeBSD supports three family of Cronyx sync adapters:
Tau-PCI - cp(4), Tau-ISA - ctau(4) and Sigma - cx(4). All these drivers
were updated (in 6.current) and now they are Giant free. However, this
is true only for sppp(4). If you are using Netgraph or async mode (for
Sigma) you may need to turn mpsafenet off for that driver with
appropriate kernel variable.

Open tasks:

1.  Now all these drivers and sppp(4) are using recursive lock. So the
    first task is to make these locks non recursive.
2.  Second task is to check/make drivers workable in netgraph/async
    mode.
3.  I think about ability to switch between sppp/netgraph mode at
    runtime. For now you should recompile module/kernel to change mode.

FreeBSD 5.3 is the first release to include PF. It went out okay, but
some bugs were discovered too late to make it on the CD. It is recommend
to update `src/sys/contrib/pf' to RELENG_5. The specific issues
addressed are:

-   Possible NULL-deref with user/group rules.
-   Crash with binat on dynamic interfaces.
-   Silent dropping of IPv6 packets with option headers.
-   Endless loops with `static-port' rules.

Most of these issues were discovered by FreeBSD users and got fed back
to OpenBSD. This is a prime example of open source at work.

The Handbook's Firewall section was modified to mention PF as an
alternative to IPFW and IPF.

Open tasks:

1.  Write more documentation/articles.
2.  Write an IPFilter to PF migration guide/tool.

During 2004, there were several notable changes and events related to
the FreeBSD Security Officer role and Security Team.

The charter for the Security Officer (SO) as approved by Core in 2002
was finally published on the web site. This document describes the
mission, responsibilities, and authorities of the SO. (The current SO is
Jacques Vidrine.)

The SO is supported by a Deputy SO and the Security Team. In April,
Chris Faulhaber resigned as Deputy SO and Dag-Erling Smorgrav was
appointed in his place. Also during the year, the following team members
resigned: Julian Elischer, Bill Fumerola, Daniel Harris, Trevor Johnson,
Kris Kennaway, Mark Murray, Wes Peters, Bruce Simpson, and Bill Swingle;
while the following became new members: Josef El-Rayes, Simon L.
Nielsen, Colin Percival, and Tom Rhodes. A huge thanks is due to all
past and current members! The current Security Team membership is
published on the web site.

With the release of FreeBSD 4.8, the SO began extended support for some
FreeBSD releases and their corresponding security branches. "Early
adopter" branches, such as FreeBSD 5.0 (RELENG_5_0), are supported for
at least six months. "Normal" branches are supported for at least one
year. "Extended" branches, such as FreeBSD 5.3 (RELENG_5_3), are
supported for at least two years. The currently supported branches and
their estimated "end of life" (EoL) dates are published on the FreeBSD
Security Information web page. In 2004, four releases "expired": 4.7,
4.9, 5.1, and 5.2.

With the releases of FreeBSD 4.10 and 5.3, the SO and the Release
Engineering team extended the scope of security branches to incorporate
critical bug fixes unrelated to security issues. Currently, separate
Errata Notices are published for such fixes. In the future, Security
Advisories and Errata Notices will be merged and handled uniformly.

17 Security Advisories were published in 2004, covering 8 issues
specific to FreeBSD and 9 general issues.

2004 also saw the introduction of the Vulnerabilities and Exposures
Markup Language (VuXML). VuXML is a markup language designed for the
documentation of security issues within a single package collection.
Over 325 security issues in the Ports Collection have been documented
already in the FreeBSD Project's VuXML document by the Security Team and
other committers. This document is currently maintained in the ports
repository, path ports/security/vuxml/vuln.xml. The contents of the
document are made available in a human-readable form at the FreeBSD
VuXML web site. The "portaudit" tool can be used to audit your local
system against the listed issues. Starting in November, the popular
FreshPorts.org web site also tracks issues documented in VuXML.

A public Subversion mirror of the FreeBSD repository is provided at
svn://svn.clkao.org/freebsd/. This is intended for people who would like
to try the svk distributed version control system.

svk allows you to mirror the whole repository and commit when offline.
It also provides history-sensitive branching, merging, and patches.
Non-committers can easily maintain their own branch and track upstream
changes while their patches are being reviewed.

Wiki with new software

  Wiki    URL: http://wiki.freebsd.org/

Contact: Josef El-Rayes <josef@FreeBSD.org>

After experiencing spam attacks on the old wiki-engine caused by
non-existent authentification mechanism, I had to replace it with a more
advanced software. Instead of usemod, we now run moinmoin. As a
consequence it's no longer just a 'browse & edit', but you have to sign
up and let someone who is already in the ACL group 'developers' add you
to the group. So it is a 'developers-only' resource now. The old wiki is
found at http://wiki2.daemon.li

Open tasks:

1.  Move content from old wiki to new one.
