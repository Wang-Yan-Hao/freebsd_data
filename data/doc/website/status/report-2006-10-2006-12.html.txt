Introduction

Happy New Year. This Report covers the last quarter of a exciting year
2006 for FreeBSD development. FreeBSD 6.2 is finally out of the door and
work towards FreeBSD 7.0 is gearing up. Some of the projects in this
report will be part of that effort, others are already in the tree. Many
projects need your help with testing and otherwise. Please see the "Open
tasks" sections for more information.

The BSD crowd will meet at AsiaBSDCon March 8-10th in Tokyo and a two
day FreeBSD developer summit will be held at BSDCan May 16-19th in
Ottawa. Finally, EuroBSDCon September 14-15th in Copenhagen is already
looking for papers.

Thanks to all the reporters for the excellent work! We hope you enjoy
reading.

FreeSBIE is approaching the 2.0-RELEASE. The first release candidate
proved to be good enough but a second one will probably be released. An
external developer is working on integrating BSDInstaller in FreeSBIE
2.0 and this may cause a little delay of the release date. Release Notes
were written and need to be updated with the current list of packages. A
script which allows to switch Tor+Privoxy on and off was added and its
usage was documented. The 2.0-RELEASE is near, hopefully near the end of
January but this will also depend on when FreeBSD 6.2-RELEASE will be
released.

The network stack virtualization project aims at extending the FreeBSD
kernel to maintain multiple independent instances of networking state.
This will allow for complete networking independence between jails on a
system, including giving each jail its own firewall, virtual network
interfaces, rate limiting, routing tables, and IPSEC configuration.

The prototype currently virtualizes the basic INET and INET6 kernel
structures and subsystems, including the TCP machinery and the IPFW
firewall. The focus is currently being kept on resolving bugs and
sporadic lockups, and defining the internal and management APIs. It is
expected that within the next month the code will become sufficiently
complete and stable for testing by early adopters.

During the last three months there has not been so much activity in the
USB project. Some regression issues have been reported and fixed. Bernd
Walter reports that he has got the new USB stack working on ARM
processors with some minor tweaks. Markus Brueffer reports that he is
working on the USB HID parser and support. A current issue with the new
USB stack is that the EHCI driver does not work on the Sparc64
architecture. If someone has got a Sparc64 with FreeBSD 7-CURRENT on and
can lend the USB project the root password, a serial console and a USB
test device, for example a USB memory stick, that would be much
appreciated. Another unresolved issue is that the ural(4) USB device
driver does not always work. This is currently being worked on.

If you want to test the new USB stack, check out the USB perforce tree
or download the SVN version of the USB driver from my USB homepage. At
the moment the tarballs are a little out of date.

Ideas and comments with regard to the new USB API are welcome at
freebsd-usb@FreeBSD.org .

Contact: Florent Thoumie <flz@FreeBSD.org>

Following the example of our NetBSD friends, we organized a couple of
Bugathons to help decreasing the open PR count. At first, it was decided
to make it a monthly event focused on both src, ports and doc. Audience
decreased with each Bugathon organized and less non-ports committers
attended the events. So from now on, we will focus on ports (making it a
Portathon) and organize a new event after the end of each ports freeze
(that should be twice a year, at most).

Porting ZFS to FreeBSD

The ZFS file system works quite well on FreeBSD now. The first patchset
has already been published on the freebsd-fs@FreeBSD.org mailing list .

All file system methods are already implemented (except ACL-related).
Basically all stress tests I tried work, even under very high load.
There is still a problem with memory allocation, which can get out of
control, but from what I know the SUN guys also work on this.

Recently I have been working on a file system regression test suite.
From what I found, there are no such test suites for free. I've already
more than 3000 tests and I'm testing correctness of most file system
related syscalls (chflags, chmod, chown, link, mkdir, mkfifo, open,
rename, rmdir, symlink, truncate, unlink). I'm also working to make it
usable on other operating systems (like Solaris, where it already works
and Linux).

Few days ago I also (almost) finished NFS support. You can't use the
'zfs share' command yet, but you can export file systems via
/etc/exports and you can also access snapshots. It was quite hard,
because snapshots are separate file systems and after exporting the main
file system, we need to also serve data from snapshots under it.

The one big thing which is missing is ACL support. This is not an easy
task, because we first have to make some decisions. Currently we use
POSIX ACLs in our UFS, but the market is moving slowly to
NTFS/NFSv4-type ACLs. In Solaris they use POSIX ACLs for UFS and
NFSv4-type ACLs for ZFS and we probably also want to use NFSv4-type ACLs
in our ZFS, which requires some work outside ZFS.

FreeBSD 6.2-RELEASE, the first release of FreeBSD with experimental
audit support is now available. The plan is to make audit a full
production feature as of FreeBSD 6.3-RELEASE, with "options AUDIT"
compiled in by default. A TODO list has been posted to trustedbsd-audit.

OpenBSM 1.0 alpha 13, which includes support for XML record printing,
additional 64-bit token types, additional audit events, and more
cross-platform build support, has been released. OpenBSM 1.0 alpha 14,
which adds support for warnings clean building with gcc 4.1, will be
released shortly. The new OpenBSM release will be merged to FreeBSD CVS
in late January or early February.

Open tasks:

1.  Complete assignment of audit events to non-native and a few
    remaining native system calls. Add additional system call argument
    auditing.
2.  Merge MAC Framework hooks allowing MAC modules to control access to
    kernel audit services. Refine and merge MAC labeling support in
    audit, including support for MAC annotations in the audit trail.
3.  Complete pass through user space services adding audit support to
    system management tools (and ftpd). Work with third party software
    maintainers to add audit support for applications like xdm/kdm/gdm.
4.  Merge latest OpenBSM, including XML output support.

Contact: <trustedbsd-discuss@TrustedBSD.org>

Most work on the MAC Framework during this period, other than as relates
to the priv(9) project described in a separate status report, has been
in refinement of the structure of the framework.

-   Add two new entry points allowing MAC Framework policy modules to
    grant or limit fine-grained system privileges.
-   A sample mac_priv(4) policy module has been created demonstrating
    how a MAC Framework policy module can grant specific system
    privileges to specific users.
-   Commenting throughout the MAC Framework significantly extended.
-   Correct a bug in which the original ifnet label was copied to user
    space via ioctl, rather than the thread-local copy.
-   mac_enforce_subsystem debugging sysctls removed, as some policies
    rely on access control checks being called even when non-enforcing
    (specifically, information flow related policies).
-   Break out mac.h include file into mac.h (user API, system calls) and
    mac_framework.h (in-kernel interface to the MAC Framework). Move
    non-user MAC include files from src/sys to src/sys/security/mac.
    Move and break out kern_mac.c into mac_framework.c and
    mac_syscalls.c. The MAC Framework is now entirely located in
    src/sys/security/mac.
-   Export the MAC Framework version via a read-only sysctl and provide
    a #define version usable by policies.
-   MAC Framework locking optimized to optimistically expect no write
    lock contention during read locking.

Open tasks:

1.  Now that the MAC Framework has been fully moved to
    src/sys/security/mac, embark on the 'mac2' interface cleanup, in
    which many MAC Framework entry points are renamed for consistency.
    This will require most MAC Framework policy modules to be modified
    between FreeBSD 6.x and FreeBSD 7.x, although in a way that can be
    largely done using sed.
2.  Add accessor functions for policies retrieving per-policy label data
    from labels, so that policy modules do not compile in the binary
    layout of struct label. This will allow future optimization of the
    label layout.
3.  Complete integration of audit and MAC support, allowing MAC policy
    modules to control access to audit interfaces, and allowing them to
    annotate audit records.

TrustedBSD priv(9)

TrustedBSD priv(9) replaces suser(9) as an in-kernel interface for
checking privilege in FreeBSD 7.x. Each privilege check now takes a
specific named privilege. This allows both centralization of jail logic
relating to privilege, which is currently distributed around the kernel
at the point of each call to suser(9), and allows instrumentation of the
privilege logic by the MAC Framework. Two new MAC Framework entry
points, one to grant and the other to limit privilege, are now
available, providing fine-grained control of kernel privilege by policy
modules. This lays the kernel infrastructure groundwork for further
refinement and extension of the kernel privilege model. The priv(9)
implementation has been committed to FreeBSD 7-CURRENT.

This software was developed by Robert N. M. Watson for the TrustedBSD
Project under contract to nCircle Network Security, Inc.

Open tasks:

1.  Complete review of kernel privilege checks, removal of suser(9) jail
    flag now that checks are centralized.
2.  Explore possible changes to kernel privilege model along lines of
    POSIX.1e privileges, the Solaris privilege interface, etc. This has
    been explored previously as part of the TrustedBSD Capabilities
    project also.

In the time since the last status report, four security advisories have
been issued concerning problems in the base system of FreeBSD (three in
2006 and one in 2007); of these, one problem was in "contributed" code,
while the remaining three were in code maintained within FreeBSD. The
Vulnerabilities and Exposures Markup Language (VuXML) document has
continued to be updated by the Security Team and Ports Committers
documenting new vulnerabilities in the FreeBSD Ports Collection; since
the last status report, 55 new entries have been added, bringing the
total up to 869.

In order to streamline security team operations and ensure that incoming
emails are promptly acknowledged, Remko Lodder has been appointed the
security team secretary.

The following FreeBSD releases are supported by the FreeBSD Security
Team: FreeBSD 4.11, FreeBSD 5.5, FreeBSD 6.0, FreeBSD 6.1, and FreeBSD
6.2. The respective End of Life dates of supported releases are listed
on the web site; of particular note, FreeBSD 4.11 and FreeBSD 6.0 will
cease to be supported at the end of January 2007.

The recent activities of the Release Engineering team have centered
around FreeBSD 6.2-RELEASE, which is now available for downloading. This
is the latest release from the RELENG_6 branch, and includes many new
performance and stability improvements, bug fixes, and new features. The
release notes and errata notes for FreeBSD 6.2 contain more specific
information about what's new in this version. We thank the FreeBSD
developer and user community for their efforts towards making this
release possible.

The Release Engineering Team also produced snapshots of FreeBSD CURRENT
in November 2006 and January 2007. These snapshots have not received
extensive testing, and should not be used in production environments.
However, they can be used for testing or experimentation, and show the
kinds of functionality that can be expected in future FreeBSD releases.

The FreeBSD Foundation ended 2006 raising over $100,000. We received
commitments for another $55,000 in donations for the Fall Fundraiser. We
fell short of our goal of raising $200,000. But, we are working hard to
fill this gap, early in 2007, so we can continue with the same level of
support for the project and community. Please go to
http://www.freebsdfoundation.org/donate/ to find out how to make a
donation to the foundation.

We added a donors page to our website to acknowledge our generous
donors. We negotiated and are now actively managing a joint technology
project with NLNet and the University of Zagreb to develop virtualized
network stack support for FreeBSD. We sponsored AsiaBSDCon and are now
accepting travel grant applications for this conference.

We are working to upgrade the project's network testbed with 10Gigabit
interconnects. Cisco has generously donated a 10Gigabit switch and we
have received network adapters from Myricom, Neterion, Intel, and
Chelsio. Adapters from other vendors are being solicited so that we can
do interoperability testing.

Network Infrastructure

Automatic TCP Send and Receive Socket Buffer Sizing

  ------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Links                     
  Patch against 7-CURRENT   URL: http://people.FreeBSD.org/~andre/tcp_auto_buf-20061212.diff
  Patch against RELENG_6    URL: http://people.FreeBSD.org/~andre/tcp_auto_buf-20061212-RELENG_6.diff
  ------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contact: Andre Oppermann <andre@FreeBSD.org>

Normally the socket buffers are static (either derived from global
defaults or set with setsockopt) and do not adapt to real network
conditions. Two things happen: a) your socket buffers are too small and
you can't reach the full potential of the network between both hosts; b)
your socket buffers are too big and you waste a lot of kernel memory for
data just sitting around.

With automatic TCP send and receive socket buffers we can start with a
small buffer and quickly grow it in parallel with the TCP congestion
window to match real network conditions.

FreeBSD has a default 32K send socket buffer. This supports a maximal
transfer rate of only slightly more than 2Mbit/s on a 100ms RTT
trans-continental link. Or at 200ms just above 1Mbit/s. With TCP send
buffer auto scaling and the default values below it supports 20Mbit/s at
100ms and 10Mbit/s at 200ms. That's an improvement of factor 10, or
1000%. For the receive side it looks slightly better with a default of
64K buffer size.

The automatic send buffer sizing patch is currently running on one half
of the FTP.FreeBSD.ORG cluster w/o any problems so far. Against this
machine with the automatic receive buffer sizing patch I can download at
5.7 MBytes per second. Without patch it maxed out at 1.6 MBytes per
second as the delay bandwidth product became equal to the static socket
buffer size without hitting the limits of the physical link between the
machines. My test machine is about 35ms from that FTP.FreeBSD.ORG and
connected through a moderately loaded 100Mbit Internet link.

New sysctls are:

-   net.inet.tcp.sendbuf_auto=1 (enabled)
-   net.inet.tcp.sendbuf_inc=8192 (8K, step size)
-   net.inet.tcp.sendbuf_max=262144 (256K, growth limit)
-   net.inet.tcp.recvbuf_auto=1 (enabled)
-   net.inet.tcp.recvbuf_inc=16384 (16K, step size)
-   net.inet.tcp.recvbuf_max=262144 (256K, growth limit)

Support for in-kernel NAT, redirect and LSNAT for ipfw was committed to
HEAD, and i encourage people to test it so we can quickly discover/fix
bugs.

To add these features to ipfw, compile a new kernel adding "options
IPFIREWALL_NAT" to your kernel config or, in case you use modules, add
"CFLAGS += -DIPFIREWALL_NAT" to your make.conf.

Open tasks:

1.  Teach libalias to handle mbufs (this will fix TSO-capable NICs).
2.  Add support for hardware checksum offloading.

MPD is moving to the next major release - mpd4_0. At the end of October
one more beta version (4_0b5) was released and first RC is planned soon.

Since 3_18 and 4_0b4 numerous bugs and cases of incorrect internal
handling have been fixed. Performance has been increased and system
requirements reduced.

Many new features have been implemented:

-   IPv6 support
-   NAT (using the ng_nat(4) node)
-   integrated web server
-   Deflate and Predictor-1 CCP compression

Some historically broken features have been reimplemented:

-   TCP and UDP link types
-   CCP compression
-   ECP encryption

To support compression, two new Netgraph nodes ng_deflate and ng_pred1
have been created and the ng_ppp node has been modified.

Open tasks:

1.  ng_ppp node refactoring.
2.  Implement packet loss notification in related Netgraph nodes
    (ng_ppp, ng_pptp, ng_async, ng_deflate, ng_pred1, ng_vjc, ...) to
    reduce recovery time and probability of incorrect packet
    decompression.
3.  MPD auth subsystem refactoring.

Wireless Networking

Contact: Sam Leffler <sam@errno.com>

Work on wireless support has continued to evolve in the public CVS tree
while other work has been going on behind the scenes in the developer's
perforce repository.

Support was recently added to HEAD for half- and quarter-rate channels
as found in the 4.9 GHz FCC Public Safety Band. This work was a
prerequisite to adding similar support in the 900 MHz band as found in
Ubiquiti's SR9 cards. Adding this functionality was straightforward due
to the design of the net80211 layer, requiring only some additions to
handle the unusual mapping between frequencies and IEEE channel numbers.
The ath(4) driver currently supports hardware capable of operating on
half- and quarter-rate channels.

Kip Macy recently made significant advances preparing legacy drivers for
the re-architected net80211 layer that has been languishing in perforce.
With his efforts this code is nearly ready for public testing after
which it can be merged into CVS. Our goal is to complete this merge in
time for the 7.x branch (otherwise it will be forced to wait for 8.0
before it appears in a public release). This revised net80211 layer
includes advanced station mode facilities such as background scanning
and roaming and support for Atheros' SuperG extensions. Getting the
revised scanning work into CVS will greatly simplify public distribution
of the Virtual AP (VAP) code as a patch as well as enable addition of
802.11n support.

Benjamin Close is working on support for the Intel 3945 parts commonly
found in laptops. The work is going on in the perforce repository with
public code drops for testing.

Atheros PCI/Cardbus support was updated with a new HAL that fixes a few
minor issues and corrects a problem that kept AR2424 parts from working.
The new HAL also enables more efficient use of the hardware keycache for
TKIP keys; on newer hardware you can now support up to 57 stations
without faulting keys into the cache. Support for the latest 802.11n
parts found in the new Lenovo and Apple laptops (among others) is in
development; initial release will support only legacy operation.

Support for Atheros USB devices is coming. Atheros has agreed to license
their firmware with the same license applied to the HAL which means it
can be committed to the tree and distributed as part of releases. The
driver is still in development.

wpa_supplicant and hostapd were updated to the latest stable build
releases from Jouni Malinen. Shortly the in-tree code base will switch
to the 0.5.x tree which will bring in much new functionality including
dynamic VLAN tagging that will be especially useful once the multi-bss
support is available.

The support for injection of raw 802.11 frames was committed to HEAD.
This work was done in collaboration with Andrea Bittau. At this point
there are no plans to commit this to the STABLE branch as it requires
API changes.

Kernel

Cryptographic Subsystem

  -------
  Links
  -------

Contact: Sam Leffler <sam@FreeBSD.org>

Michael Richardson has been spearheading work to improve the crypto
subsystem used by various parts of the kernel including Fast IPSec and
geli. This work is sponsored by Hifn and has been happening outside the
CVS repository. A main focus of this work is to add support for
higher-level hardware operations that can significantly improve the
performance of IPSec and SSL protocols.

Results of this work are now being readied for CVS. These redesign the
core/driver APIs to use the kobj facilities and recast software crypto
drivers as pseudo devices. The changes greatly improve the system and
permit new functionality such as specifying which crypto device to use
when multiple are available. The redesign will also enable load
balancing of crypto work across multiple devices and the addition of
virtual crypto sessions by which small operations can be done in
software when the overhead to set up a hardware device is too costly.

In addition to the changes to the core crypto system several crypto
drivers have been updated to improve their operation. Top of this list
is the hifn(4) driver where many longstanding bugs have been fixed for
7955/756 parts.

Interrupt Filtering

  ------- -----------------------------------------
  Links   
          URL: http://wiki.FreeBSD.org/Interrupts
  ------- -----------------------------------------

Contact: Paolo Pisati <piso@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: John Baldwin <jhb@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Scott Long <scottl@FreeBSD.org>

Interrupt filtering is a new method to handle interrupts in FreeBSD that
retains backward compatibility with the previous models (FAST and
ITHREAD), while improving over them in some aspects. With interrupt
filtering, the interrupt handler is divided into 2 parts: the filter
(that checks if the actual interrupt belongs to a device) and a private
per-handler ithread (that is scheduled in case some blocking work has to
be done). The main benefits of this work are:

-   Feedback from filters (the operating system finally knows what's the
    state of an event and can react consequently).
-   Lower latency/overhead for shared interrupt line.
-   Previous experiments with interrupt filtering showed an increase in
    performance against the plain ithread model in some cases.
-   General shrink of the machine dependent code - part of the
    interrupting handling code was turned into machine independent code.

During the last quarter many improvements were made up to the point
where 3 archs (i386, amd64 and arm) are reported to work, and the
project can be considered feature complete.

I definitely want to make it part of the 7.0 release.

Open tasks:

1.  Define a road map to commit the code into the tree.
2.  Rethink the interrupt stray handling (?!?!).
3.  Finish off support for powerpc, sparc64 and ia64 (sun4v support is
    known to be broken now).

Contact: Alexander Leidinger <netchild@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Multimedia Mailinglist <multimedia@FreeBSD.org>

Since the last status report there were improvements to the emu10kx
driver for High Definition Audio (HDA) compatible chips. Some more chips
are supported now and already supported chips should provide a better
zero-configuration experience.

The generic sound code got some very nice low latency changes, and fixes
which make it multichannel/endian/format safe. We do not support
multichannel operation yet, but this work is a prerequisite to work on
implementing multichannel operation. This work also fixed some bugs
which people may experience as clicks, hickups, truncation or similar
behavior in the sound-output.

So far there is no merge to 5.x or 6.x planned for this code, especially
because there are API/ABI changes, e.g., several sysctls changed. People
who do not care about this can download binary sound modules from
Ariff's download page for 6.x and 5.x.

We thank all people who tested the changes / submitted patches and thus
helped improving the sound system.

Open tasks:

1.  Have a look at the sound related entries on the ideas list.
2.  Add multichannel support.
3.  sndctl(1): tool to control non-mixer parts of the sound system (e.g.
    spdif switching, virtual-3D effects) by a user (instead of the
    sysctl approach in -CURRENT); pcmplay(1), pcmrec(1), pcmutil(1).
4.  Plugable FEEDER infrastructure. For ease of debugging various feeder
    stuff and/or as userland library and test suite.
5.  Extend the wiki page.

Update of the Linux Compatibility Environment in the Kernel

  ------------------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------------

  ------------------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------------

Contact: Alexander Leidinger <netchild@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Roman Divacky <rdivacky@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Emulation Mailinglist <emulation@FreeBSD.org>

Since the last status report we made good progress in improving the
compatibility environment. We fixed more than 30 testcases on i386 (130
testcases = 16% still failing) and more than 60 testcases on amd64 (140
testcases = 17% still failing) in the Linux 2.4 compatibility. These
numbers compare FreeBSD 6.2 with -CURRENT. Some of those fixes are edge
cases in the error handling, and some of them fix real issues -- e.g.
hangs -- and improve the stability and correctness of the emulation.

Regarding the Linux 2.6 compatibility there are 140 testcases (17%) on
i386 and 150 testcases (18%) on amd64 still failing in -CURRENT. After
fixing some showstopper problems with real applications, we should be
able to give the 2.6 emulation a more widespread exposure "soon" to find
more bugs and to determine the importance of those Linux syscalls which
we did not implement yet.

The severity of the broken testcases varies, and some of them will never
be fixed, e.g., we will never be able to load Linux kernel modules into
a FreeBSD kernel, being able to add swap with a Linux command has very
low priority, and fixing stuff which is used by applications like IPC
type 17 has high priority.

Some differences in the 2.6 compatibility are because not all i386
changes are merged into the amd64 code, and some testcases are already
fixed in our perforce repository but need more review before they can be
committed to -CURRENT.

We need some more testers and bug reporters. So if you have a little bit
of time and a favorite Linux application, please play around with it on
-CURRENT. If there is a problem, have a look at the wiki if we already
know about it and report on emulation@ . We are especially interested in
reports about the 2.6 compatibility (sysctl
compat.linux.osversion=2.6.16), but only with the most recent -CURRENT
and maybe with some patches we have in the perforce repository
(mandatory on amd64).

We thank all people who tested the changes / submitted patches and thus
helped improving the Linux compatibility environment.

Hardware Drivers

Bt878 Audio Driver (aka FusionHDTV 5 Lite driver)

  ---------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Links                        
  Perforce source repository   URL: http://perforce.freebsd.org/fileSearch.cgi?FSPC=%2F%2Fdepot%2Fuser%2Fjmg%2Fbktrau%2F...&ignore=GO%21
  ---------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contact: John-Mark Gurney <jmg@FreeBSD.org>

Basic audio capture is working. All of the parameters are set by
userland, while the RISC program generation is by kernel. No real audio
has been captured as there are no drivers for the NTSC tuner yet.
Someone with a real Bt878 NTSC card that is supported by bktr(4) could
use this to capture audio without using the sound card.

Due to lack of documentation from DViCO and LG, I have copied magic
values from the Linux driver and managed to get ATSC capturing working.
There was a bug in the capture driver that was releasing buffers to
userland early causing what appeared to be reception issues. Now that we
use the RISC status bits as buffer completion bits, capture works
cleanly. This does mean that even if you provide more than 4 buffers to
the driver, the buffers will be divided into four segments, and returned
in segments.

A Python module is available, along with a sample capture application
using it. The module is now known to work well with threads so that
tuning (expensive due to i2c ioctls) can happen in another thread
without causing program slow down. The module is working well with a
custom PVR backend.

Additional ioctls have been added to get sibling devices. This allows
one to open a bktrau device, and get the correct bktr(4) device that is
in the same slot. This is necessary so that when adjusting GPIO pins or
sending i2c commands, they are to the correct device.

Open tasks:

1.  Provide support for NTSC and FM tuning.
2.  Add support for other cards and tuners that use the Bt878 chip.

In addition to other more detailed reports this is intended to give a
summary about other ongoing or upcoming BSNMP related work. To collect
some ideas from users and coordinate work a BSNMP TODO Wiki page was
created. Feel free to add your ideas or let us know about them.

-   A contributor, Tsvetan Erenditsov, has volunteered to implement a
    VLAN module for BSNMP. Shteryana is helping him.
-   Sam Leffler has asked for a wireless networking monitoring module,
    which will most likely be the next module to be implemented.
-   Some major work is currently going on in the main BSNMP tree:
    -   SNMP transports have been factored out into loadable modules.
        The old port tables are still there and will remain at least for
        the next release. Later they will be removed. The following
        modules and transports are already implemented as loadable
        modules:
        -   snmp_trans_udp: SNMP over UDP over IPv4, IPv6 and scoped
            IPv6
        -   snmp_trans_tcp: SNMP over TCP over IPv4, IPv6 and scoped
            IPv6
        -   snmp_trans_ldgram: SNMP over local datagram sockets
        -   snmp_trans_lstream: SNMP over local stream sockets
    -   Some I/O functions have been moved from the daemon to libbsnmp.
    -   libisa has been imported into the bsnmp tree. This library aims
        at easy implementation of command line tools for remote and
        local system administration with a special focus on
        administration via SNMP. The library contains command line
        parsing functions, a function for automatically handling help
        text. Actual administration modules are implemented as loadable
        modules. The atmconfig tool in the FreeBSD tree contains some
        old parts of this library.
    -   lisa_snmp is a module which implements SNMP functionality for
        libisa.
    -   lisa_snmpd is a module for remote administration of the bsnmpd.
    -   The config file parser of bsnmpd has been rewritten so that each
        section of the file is handled as a transaction (in contrast to
        the previous behavior where the entire file was one
        transaction).

Contact: Shteryana Shopova <syrinx@FreeBSD.org>

The BSNMP bridge module for FreeBSD's BSNMP daemon, which was
implemented during SoC 2006, was committed to HEAD. In addition to RFC
4188 single bridge support it also supports monitoring multiple bridges
via a private MIB. Since SoC 2006 Rapid Spanning Tree (RSTP) support
(RSTP-MIB defined in RFC4318 and additions to the private MIB) was added
to the module as well.

A patch for RELENG_6 is available and will be merged to STABLE the next
weeks.

Open tasks:

1.  MFC to RELENG_6.
2.  More feedback from users is always welcome.

During SoC 2005 BSNMP client tools (bsnmptools) were implemented and
have since then been available via Shteryana's P4 tree or port
net-mgmt/bsnmptools.

In order to finally get the code committed some cleanup was needed which
ended in a partly rewrite to minimize duplicate code and to reduce the
size of the binaries. This ongoing work is available via Bjoern's P4
tree and will be merged back to upstream trees before it will be
committed to HEAD.

Open tasks:

1.  Update Wiki Page to reflect latest work.
2.  Finish cleanup and have it reviewed.
3.  User feedback is always welcome.

Contact: Olivier Houchard <cognet@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Sam Leffler <sam@FreeBSD.org>

FreeBSD is running multi-user on a variety of Gateworks Avila boards
with most of the on-board devices supported. These include the compact
flash/IDE slot, wired network interfaces, realtime clock, and
environmental sensors. Several different minipci cards have been tested
including those supported by the ath(4) and hifn(4) drivers. Remaining
devices that need support are the onboard flash, optional 4-port network
switch, and optional USB interface. Crypto acceleration for IXP425 parts
is planned but will likely be done at a later time.

The Network Processor Engine (NPE) support is done with an entirely new
replacement for the Intel Access Layer (IAL). The most important
hardware facilities are supported (e.g. the hardware Q manager) and the
wired NIC driver was also done from scratch. The resulting code is
approximately 1/10th the number of lines of the equivalent IAL code.

Open tasks:

1.  Bootstrap support needs work to enable booting from the compact
    flash device.

Contact: Rafal Jaworowski <raj@semihalf.com>
Contact: Marcel Moolenaar <xcllnt@mac.com>

Platform summary:

-   PowerQuiccIII integrated controller
-   e500 CPU core
-   compliant with PowerPC BookE specification (significantly different
    from the 'traditional' PowerPC architecture the current
    FreeBSD/powerpc supports, particularly in the areas of MMU design,
    exceptions model, specific e500 machine instructions etc.)

Currently the machine is booting FreeBSD 6.1-RELEASE-p10 and operating
both single- and multi-user modes; below are highlights of available
functionality:

1.  Low-level support

2.  -   booting from U-Boot bootloader
    -   locore machine initialization
    -   e500 exceptions
    -   VM: a new pmap module developed

3.  On-chip peripherals

4.  -   introduced ocpbus hierarchy (nexus and descendants)
    -   interrupt controller: using generic OpenPIC driver
    -   serial console: using uart(4) driver
    -   barebones serial support using the QUICC's SCC
    -   host/PCI bridge: a new driver developed for the built-in bridge
    -   networking: a new driver developed for TSEC (3-speed Ethernet)

5.  Booting

6.  -   from ATA disk and USB memory stick (both through a secondary PCI
        VIA82C686B controller)
    -   from network (NFS-mounted rootfs)

7.  Basic TCP/IP protocols and apps work (DHCP, NFS, SSH, FTP, Telnet
    etc.)

8.  Userland

9.  -   integrated SoftFloat emulation lib (required due to e500 not
        being equipped with the old-style PowerPC FPU)
    -   almost all applications seem to work

Open tasks:

1.  Work out extensible layout for sys/powerpc architecture directory so

FreeBSD GNOME Project

Contact: FreeBSD GNOME Project <gnome@FreeBSD.org>

Where have we been?! Not doing status reports, that's for sure. But the
FreeBSD GNOME project has been very busy with regular GNOME releases,
and other side projects. We are currently shipping GNOME 2.16.2 in the
ports tree, and we are testing GNOME 2.17.5 in the MarcusCom tree.

Most recently, work has completed on a cleanup of the FreeBSD backend to
libgtop. This module has needed a lot of work, and should now be
reporting correct system statistics. The cleaned up version is currently
being tested in the MarcusCom tree, and will make it into the FreeBSD
ports tree along with GNOME 2.18.

The GStreamer framework has been taken out of direct gnome@
maintainership, and put under a new multimedia@ umbrella. This will give
multimedia-savvy developers a chance to collaborate on this important
piece of the GNOME Desktop along with other important audio and video
components.

The biggest accomplishment of 2006 for the FreeBSD GNOME team had to
have been the port of HAL . This effort was started to give FreeBSD
users a richer desktop experience. Since the initial FreeBSD release of
HAL with GNOME 2.16, it has been incorporated into the FreeBSD release
of KDE 3.5.5 as well as PC-BSD 1.3. The FreeBSD backend has also made it
upstream into the HAL git repository so future releases of HAL will have
FreeBSD support out-of-the-box.

Finally, it is with sadness that we say good-bye to one of our team
members. Adam Weinberger stepped down from the FreeBSD GNOME team to
save lives instead (priorities, man!). His splash screens and grammar
nit-picking will be missed.

Open tasks:

1.  Now that HAL has been ported to FreeBSD, there is a strong desire to
    see NetworkManager ported. The big parts will be porting NM to use
    our 80211 framework, and extending some of the base utilities such
    as ifconfig. Contact marcus@FreeBSD.org if you are interested in
    helping.
2.  Our system-tools-backends module needs some attention. This module
    is responsible for system configuration tasks in GNOME such as user
    management, network shares administration, etc. A knowledge of Perl
    is highly recommended. Contact marcus@FreeBSD.org if you are
    interested in helping.
3.  We need good documentation writers to help update our FAQ and other
    documentation. If you would like to take on the responsibility
    full-time, or just contribute some pieces, please notify
    gnome@FreeBSD.org .
4.  We are always in need of GNOME development testers. See our
    development branch FAQ for ways on how you can help make the next
    release of GNOME the best release.

There have been a number of improvements to FreshPorts over the last
quarter of 2006. The following are just a few of them. The links take
you to the relevant article within the FreshPorts News website .

-   Better pagination of larger result sets
-   Listing of sanity test failures
-   Inclusion of latest vulnerabilities on the front page
-   Started working on adding tools to make FreshSource/FreshPorts more
    useful as a developer tool
-   The new dual opteron server has been deployed!

My thanks to the many people who have contributed suggestions, ideas,
and code over the years. Most of you are documented at the above URLs.

Open tasks:

1.  FreshPorts/FreshSource as a developer tool

The ports count has jumped to 16347. The PR count, despite a jump, has
gone back down to around 700.

Not much work has been committed on the ports infrastructure due to the
long 6.2 release cycle. However, many test runs have been done for
several upcoming features, such as making sure that ports will work with
the new release of gcc (4.1), and do not have /usr/X11R6 hard-coded into
them. The intention of the latter is to move all ports to $LOCALBASE,
which can then be selected by the user. This should help consistency
going forwards, albeit at the cost of a one-time conversion.

GNOME was updated to 2.16 during the release cycle.

In addition, we are in the process of moving the FORTRAN default from
f77 to gfortran. See the ports mailing list for details.

The new xorg ports are still being worked on as well; they are intended
to all live in $LOCALBASE. Hopefully this can get done in the early 6.3
development cycle. See the wiki for more information.

A new version of the ports Tinderbox code is available, which is mostly
a bugfix release.

We have also added Pav Lucistnik as a new portmgr member, who we hope
will help us work on the portmgr PR backlog. Welcome!

We have also added 8 new committers since the last report.

linimon continues to work on resetting committers who are no longer
interested in their ports; as well, several ports commit bits have been
stored for safekeeping. This is part of an attempt to keep the best
match between volunteers and work to be done.

Open tasks:

1.  Most of the remaining ports PRs are "existing port/PR assigned to
    committer". Although the maintainer-timeout policy is helping to
    keep the backlog down, we are going to need to do more to get the
    ports in the shape they really need to be in.
2.  Although we have added many maintainers, we still have many
    unmaintained ports. As well, the packages on amd64 and sparc64 are
    lagging behind.

X.org 7.2 release has been delayed more than a month, which gave us more
time to fix build failures, to work on a few runtime issues and to
determine the easiest way to upgrade from 6.9 to 7.2 (mostly with the
help of people on the freebsd-x11@ mailing list ). Everything is in a
rather good shape but there's still a little amount of work to do. The
merge of new ports is most likely to happen before the end of January.

Open tasks:

1.  Do a global review of the diff between the original tree and the
    experimental one (git-diff origin xorg for git users)
2.  Fix the remaining (9 I think, 3 being lang/jdk's) build errors
3.  Continue testing
4.  Do another experimental build on pointyhat
