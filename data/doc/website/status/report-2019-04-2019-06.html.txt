Introduction

This quarter our report includes some interesting topics easily
accessible to anyone, even if you are not a programmer: we report the
link to a presentation of the 2019 FreeBSD survey results at BSDCan 2019
and describe an interesting experience of a 3-person hackaton, which
might encourage you to host one yourself, possibly with more
participants. We also provide some up to date information about the
status of our IRC channels.

For those who have some more technical skills, we give some news about
the role of git in the FreeBSD project, describe the status of some
tools to hunt bugs or enhance security and announce a clone of sysctl.

Finally, those who are more experienced with programming will probably
be interested in the great work that has been done with drivers: in
particular, an aknowledgement is due to Alan Somers for having started
to bring up to date our FUSE implementation, which was about 11 years
behind. Other important improvements include a more user-friendly
experience with trackpoints and touchpads enabled by default, much low
level work on graphics, many new bhyve features, updates to the linux
compatibility layer, various kernel improvements.

Have a nice read!

The FreeBSD CI team maintains continuous integration system and related
tasks for the FreeBSD project. The CI system regularly checks the
committed changes can be successfully built, then performs various tests
and analysis of the results. The results from build jobs are archived in
an artifact server, for the further testing and debugging needs. The CI
team members examine the failing builds and unstable tests, and work
with the experts in that area to fix the code or adjust test
infrastructure. The details are of these efforts are available in the
weekly CI reports.

The FCP for CI policy is in "feedback" state, please provide any
comments to freebsd-testing@ or other suitable lists.

We had a testing working group in 201905 DevSummit

Please see freebsd-testing@ related tickets for more information.

FreeBSD Core Team

Contact: FreeBSD Core Team <core@FreeBSD.org>

The FreeBSD Core Team is the governing body of FreeBSD.

-   Core approved source commit bits for Doug Moore (dougm), Chuck
    Silvers (chs), Brandon Bergren (bdragon), and a vendor commit bit
    for Scott Phillips (scottph).

-   The annual developer survey closed on 2019-04-02. Of the 397
    developers, 243 took the survey with an average completion time of
    12 minutes. The public survey closed on 2019-05-13. It was taken by
    3637 users and had a 79% completion rate. A presentation of the
    survey results took place at BSDCan 2019.

-   The core team voted to appoint a working group to explore
    transitioning our source code 'source of truth' from Subversion to
    Git. Core asked Ed Maste to chair the group as Ed has been
    researching this topic for some time. For example, Ed gave a MeetBSD
    2018 talk on the topic.

There is a variety of viewpoints within core regarding where and how to
host a Git repository, however core feels that Git is the prudent path
forward.

-   The project received many Season of Docs submissions and picked a
    top candidate. Google will announce the accepted technical writer
    projects on 2019-08-06. We are hoping for lots of new and refreshed
    man pages.

FreeBSD Foundation

Contact: Deb Goodkin <deb@FreeBSDFoundation.org>

The FreeBSD Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated
to supporting and promoting the FreeBSD Project and community worldwide.
Funding comes from individual and corporate donations and is used to
fund and manage software development projects, conferences and developer
summits, and provide travel grants to FreeBSD contributors. The
Foundation purchases and supports hardware to improve and maintain
FreeBSD infrastructure and provides resources to improve security,
quality assurance, and release engineering efforts; publishes marketing
material to promote, educate, and advocate for the FreeBSD Project;
facilitates collaboration between commercial vendors and FreeBSD
developers; and finally, represents the FreeBSD Project in executing
contracts, license agreements, and other legal arrangements that require
a recognized legal entity.

Here are some highlights of what we did to help FreeBSD last quarter:

We held our annual board meeting in Ottawa on May 14. Board Director and
Officer elections take place each year at this meeting. Justin Gibbs was
elected as the new President of the Board of Directors. The new FreeBSD
Foundation Board of Directors includes President and Founder Justin T.
Gibbs, Vice President Benedict Reuschling, Secretary Philip Paeps,
Treasurer Marshall Kirk McKusick, and Directors Hiroki Sato, George
Neville-Neil and Robert N. M. Watson. You can read more about the
elections.

After the elections, our management team gave updates to the board on
their respective areas. We then discussed the key areas of the Project
that need help, and where we can step in to fill those holes. We
reviewed and updated our 12 month goals, and identified projects we
should support. We then discussed conferences we are likely to attend,
and went over the latest on our fundraising efforts. We followed that up
with a discussion on how to get more users to contribute back to the
Project. While discussing how to increase the number of users and
contributors, we talked about methods for making for more training
material available.

Partnerships and Commercial User Support

We help facilitate collaboration between commercial users and FreeBSD
developers. We also meet with companies to discuss their needs and bring
that information back to the Project. In Q2, Ed Maste and Deb Goodkin
met with a few commercial users in Germany. It’s not only beneficial for
the above, but it also helps us understand some of the applications
where FreeBSD is used. Because BSDCan brings in a high number of
commercial users, we have an excellent opportunity to have similar
discussions about their needs during the four-day FreeBSD Summit and
BSDCan.

Fundraising Efforts

Our work is 100% funded by your donations. We are grateful for the
generous donations from Intel, NetApp, VMware and Stormshield last
quarter. We are working hard to get more commercial users to give back
to help us continue our work supporting FreeBSD. More importantly, we’d
like to thank our individual donors, for making $10-$1,000 donations
last quarter, for a total of $16,000!

Please consider making a donation to help us continue and increase our
support for FreeBSD.

We also have the Partnership Program to provide more benefits for our
larger commercial donors. Find out more information at the link and
share with your companies!

OS Improvements

The Foundation improves the FreeBSD operating system by employing our
technical staff to maintain and improve critical kernel subsystems, add
features and functionality, and fix problems. The Foundation also
provides grants to fund individual projects.

There were 243 commits to the FreeBSD base system repository sponsored
by the Foundation during the quarter. These include improvements to the
tmpfs in-memory, MSDOS, and UFS filesystems, device driver and hardware
compatibility fixes, virtual memory (VM), tool chain, documentation, and
testing and continuous integration improvements.

We fixed a number of race conditions and security issues found by
Syzkaller, Google’s code-coverage-guided system call fuzzer.

Alan Somers’ work on updating FreeBSD’s support for FUSE (userspace
filesystems) continued during the quarter; the full details are
elsewhere in this quarterly report. At this point most of the work has
been committed to the project branch but some bug fixes and improvements
have been committed directly to the FreeBSD development branch.

Edward Napierala’s Linuxulator project continued through the quarter,
resulting in a number of improvements to the Linuxulator and
linux-specific functionality such as linsysfs. This work is part of the
path to supporting the Linux strace debugging tool in order to
facilitate debugging failures of other Linux binaries under the
Linuxulator. Mateusz Guzik continued with scalability and performance
improvements during the quarter, and Bjoern Zeeb integrated the SDIO
stack (with details elsewhere in the quarterly report).

Progress was made on the online RAID-Z expansion project over the
quarter. Matt Ahrens posted an alpha preview of the feature for further
experimentation and review, and the FreeBSD Foundation will make an
alpha release image available for testing in the near future.

Foundation staff contributed to nine FreeBSD security advisories and
errata updates over the quarter, including CPU vulnerability
workarounds. Related work included improving Intel microcode update
loading.

Continuous Integration and Quality Assurance

The Foundation provides a full-time staff member who is working on
improving our automated testing, continuous integration, and overall
quality assurance efforts.

During the second quarter of 2019, Foundation staff continued to improve
the project's CI infrastructure, worked with contributors to fix the
failing build and test cases, and worked with other teams in the Project
for their testing needs. We hosted a CI-focused working group at BSDcan
and continue to publish the CI weekly report at freebsd-testing@ mailing
list.

See the FreeBSD CI section of this report for more information.

Supporting FreeBSD Infrastructure

The Foundation provides hardware and support to improve the FreeBSD
infrastructure. Last quarter, we continued supporting FreeBSD hardware
located around the world.

FreeBSD Advocacy and Education

A large part of our efforts are dedicated to advocating for the Project.
This includes promoting work being done by others with FreeBSD;
producing advocacy literature to teach people about FreeBSD and help
make the path to starting using FreeBSD or contributing to the Project
easier; and attending and getting other FreeBSD contributors to
volunteer to run FreeBSD events, staff FreeBSD tables, and give FreeBSD
presentations.

The FreeBSD Foundation sponsors many conferences, events, and summits
around the globe. These events can be BSD-related, open source, or
technology events geared towards underrepresented groups. We support the
FreeBSD-focused events to help provide a venue for sharing knowledge, to
work together on projects, and to facilitate collaboration between
developers and commercial users. This all helps provide a healthy
ecosystem. We support the non-FreeBSD events to promote and raise
awareness of FreeBSD, to increase the use of FreeBSD in different
applications, and to recruit more contributors to the Project.

Check out some of the advocacy and education work we did last quarter:

-   Represented FreeBSD at LinuxFest Northwest In Bellingham, Washington
-   Sponsored and helped organize the FreeBSD Developers Summit at
    BSDCan, in Ottawa, Canada
-   Sponsored and attended BSDCan 2019
-   Set up registration and attended the Vienna FreeBSD Security
    Hackathon in Vienna, Austria
-   Represented FreeBSD at HKOSCON
-   Attended the Berlin FreeBSD Developers Summit
-   Presented at 2019 Comcast Labs Connect Open Source Conference
-   Sponsored, presented and represented FreeBSD at RootConf 2019 in
    Bangalore, India
-   Committed to attend OSCON, and All Things Open
-   Committed to sponsor and help organize a Bay Area Developers Summit
-   Provided FreeBSD advocacy material
-   Provided travel grants to FreeBSD contributors to attend many of the
    above events

We continued producing FreeBSD advocacy material to help people promote
FreeBSD around the world.

Read more about our conference adventures in the conference recaps and
trip reports in our monthly newsletters.

We help educate the world about FreeBSD by publishing the professionally
produced FreeBSD Journal. As we mentioned previously, the FreeBSD
Journal is now a free publication. Find out more and access the latest
issues at https://www.FreeBSDfoundation.org/journal/.

You can find out more about events we attended and upcoming events.

We have continued our work with a new website developer to help us
improve our website. Work has begun to make it easier for community
members to find information more easily and to make the site more
efficient.

FreeBSD Graphics Team status report

  --------------------- ----------------------------------------
  Links                 
  Project GitHub page   URL: https://github.com/FreeBSDDesktop
  --------------------- ----------------------------------------

Contact: FreeBSD Graphics Team <x11@freebsd.org>
Contact: Niclas Zeising <zeising@freebsd.org>

The FreeBSD X11/Graphics team maintains the lower levels of the FreeBSD
graphics stack. This includes graphics drivers, graphics libraries such
as the MESA OpenGL implementation, the X.org xserver with related
libraries and applications, and Wayland with related libraries and
applications.

In the last report, half a year ago, several updates and changes had
been made to the FreeBSD graphics stack.

To further improve the user experience, and to improve input device
handling, evdev was enabled in the default configuration in late 2018.
Building on that, we have enabled IBM/Lenovo trackpoints and elantech
and synaptics touchpads by default as well.

The input device library libinput has been updated as the last in a
series of updates bringing the userland input stack up to date. This is
work that was started in 2018.

We have made several improvements to the drm kernel drivers. A
long-standing memory leak in the Intel (i915) driver has been fixed, and
several other updates and improvements have been made to the various drm
kernel driver components.

A port of the drm kernel drivers using the 5.0 Linux kernel sources has
been created and committed to FreeBSD ports as graphics/drm-devel-kmod.
This driver requires a recent Linux KPI and is only available on recent
versions of FreeBSD CURRENT.

This version of the driver contains several development improvements.
The generic drm (drm.ko) driver as well as the i915 (i915kms.ko) driver
can now be unloaded and reloaded to ease in development and testing.
This causes issues with the virtual consoles, however, so an SSH
connection is recommended. To aid debugging i915kms.ko use of debugfs
has been improved, but there are still limitations preventing it from
being fully functional. Since debugfs is based on pseudofs it is
possible that this will prevent a fully functional debugfs in its
current state, so we might have to look into adding the required
functionality to pseudofs or use another framework.

The new in-kernel drm driver for VirtualBox, vboxvideo.ko has been
ported from Linux. Support is currently an experimental work in
progress. For example the virtual console won't update after loading the
driver, but X- and Wayland-based compositors are working.

Mesa has been updated to 18.3.2 and switched from using devel/llvm60 to
use the Ports default version of llvm, currently devel/llvm80.

Several userland Xorg drivers, applications, and libraries have been
updated, and other improvements to the various userland components that
make up the Graphics Stack have been made.

We have also continued our regularly scheduled bi-weekly meetings,
although work remains in sending out timely meeting minutes afterwards.

People who are interested in helping out can find us on the
x11@FreeBSD.org mailing list, or on our gitter chat:
https://gitter.im/FreeBSDDesktop/Lobby. We are also available in
#freebsd-xorg on EFNet.

We also have a team area on GitHub where our work repositories can be
found: https://github.com/FreeBSDDesktop

------------------------------------------------------------------------

IRC Admin

Contact: IRC Admin <irc@FreeBSD.org>

The FreeBSD IRC Admin team manages the FreeBSD Project's presence and
activity on the freenode IRC network, looking after:

-   Registration and management of channels within the official
    namespace (#freebsd*)
-   Channel moderation
-   Liaising with freenode staff
-   Allocating freebsd/* hostmask cloaks for users
-   General user support relating to channel management

While the FreeBSD Project does not currently endorse IRC as an official
support channel (see here and here), as it has not been able to
guarantee a consistent or positive user experience, IRC Admin has been
working toward creating a high quality experience, by standardising
channel administration and moderation expectations, and ensuring the
projects ability to manage all channels within its namespace.

In the last quarter, IRC Admin:

-   Cleaned up (deregistered) registrations for channels that were
    defunct, stale, out of date, or had founders that were inactive (not
    seen for > 1 year). Channels that were found to be otherwise active
    have been retained. FreeBSD now has ~40 channels registered from a
    previous total of over 150.
-   Documented baseline configuration settings in the Wiki for channels,
    including ChanServ settings, channel modes, registration policy,
    etc.
-   Established multiple documented methods for reporting user abuse or
    other channel issues to IRC Admin for resolution

Upcoming changes:

-   Work with existing #freebsd* channels to standardise channel
    management, settings and access.
-   Migrate, forward and/or consolidate existing or duplicate #freebsd*
    channels to channels with a standard naming convention.
-   Work with unofficial ##freebsd* channels to migrate them to the
    official #freebsd* channels if suitable
-   Update existing IRC-related website and documentation sources the
    describe the official state of project managed IRC presence on
    freenode.

Lastly, and to repeat a previous call, while the vast majority of the
broader user community interacts on the freenode IRC network, the
FreeBSD developer presence still needs to be significantly improved on
freenode.

There are many opportunities to be had by increasing the amount and
quality of interaction between FreeBSD users and developers, both in
terms of developers keeping their finger on the pulse of the community
and in encouraging and cultivating greater contributions to the Project
over the long term.

It is critical to have a strong developer presence amongst users, and
IRC Admin would like again to call on all developers to join the FreeBSD
freenode channels to increase that presence.

Users are invited to /join #freebsd-irc on the freenode IRC network if
they have questions, ideas, constructive criticism, and feedback on how
the FreeBSD Project can improve the service and experience it provides
to the community on IRC.

Contact: René Ladan <portmgr-secretary@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: FreeBSD Ports Management Team <portmgr@FreeBSD.org>

The following was done during the last quarter by portmgr to keep things
in the Ports Tree going:

During the last quarter the number of ports rose to just under 37,000.
At the end of the quarter, there were 2146 open PRs and 7837 commits
(excluding 499 on the quarterly branch) from 172 committers. This shows
a slight decrease in activity compared to previous quarter.

People come and go, last quarter we welcomed Pedro Giffuni (pfg@), Piotr
Kubaj (pkubaj@) and Hans Petter Selasky (hselasky@). Pedro and Hans
Petter were already active as src committers. We said goodbye to
gordon@, kan@, tobez@, and wosch@.

On the infrastructure side, a new USES=cabal was introduced and various
default versions were updated: MySQL to 5.7, Python to 3.6, Ruby to 2.5,
Samba to 4.8 and Julia gained a default version of 1.0. The web browsers
were also updated: Firefox to 68.0 and Chromium to 75.0.3770.100

During the last quarter, antoine@ ran a total of 41 exp-runs to test
various package updates, bump the stack protector level to "strong",
switch the default Python version to 3.6 as opposed to 2.7, remove
sys/dir.h from base which has been deprecated for over 20 years, and
convert all Go ports to USES=go.

Contact: FreeBSD Release Engineering Team <re@FreeBSD.org>

The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is responsible for setting and
publishing release schedules for official project releases of FreeBSD,
announcing code freezes and maintaining the respective branches, among
other things.

During the second quarter of 2019, the FreeBSD Release Engineering team
started the 11.3-RELEASE cycle, with the code slush starting May 3rd.
Throughout the cycle, there were three BETA builds and three RC builds,
all of which in line with the originally-published schedule. The final
RC build started June 28th, with the final release build targeted for
July 5th.

FreeBSD 11.3-RELEASE will be the fourth release from the stable/11
branch, building on the stability and reliability of 11.2-RELEASE.

The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team also published the schedule for the
12.1-RELEASE, targeted to start September 6th. One important thing to
note regarding the published schedule is it excludes a hard freeze on
the stable/12 branch, as a test run for eliminating code freezes
entirely during a release cycle. Commits to what will be the releng/12.1
branch will still require explicit approval from the Release Engineering
Team, however.

Additionally throughout the quarter, several development snapshots
builds were released for the head, stable/12, and stable/11 branches.

Much of this work was sponsored by the FreeBSD Foundation and Rubicon
Communications, LLC (Netgate).

The Migration feature uses the Save/Restore feature to migrate a bhyve
guest from a FreeBSD host to another FreeBSD host. To migrate a bhyve
guest, one needs to start an empty guest on the destination host from a
shared guest image using the bhyve tool with the -R option followed by
the source host IP and the port to listen to migration request. On the
source host, the migration is started by executing the bhyvectl command
with the --migrate or --migrate-live option, followed by the destination
host IP and the port to send to the messages.

New features added:

-   Clear the dirty bit after each migration round
-   Extend live migration to highmem segment

Future tasks:

-   Refactor live migration branch
-   Rebase live migration
-   Extend live migration to unwired memory

This project was sponsored by Matthew Grooms.

The Save/Restore for bhyve feature is a suspend and resume facility
added to the FreeBSD/amd64's hypervisor, bhyve. The bhyvectl tool is
used to save the guest state in three files (a file for the guest
memory, a file for the states of various devices and the state of the
CPU, and another one for some metadata that is used in the restore
process). To suspend a bhyve guest, the bhyvectl tool must be run with
the --suspend <state_file_name> option followed by the guest name.

To restore a bhyve guest from a checkpoint, one simply has to add the -r
option followed by the main state file (the same file that was given to
the --suspend option for bhyvectl) when starting the VM.

New features added:

-   Open ticket on Phabricator
-   Apply feedback received from community

Future tasks:

-   Add suspend/resume support for nvme
-   Add suspend/resume support for virtio-console
-   Add suspend/resume support for virtio-scsi
-   Add TSC offsetting for restore for AMD CPUs

BIO_DELETE support for the swap pager

Contact: Doug Moore <dougm@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Alan Cox <alc@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Mark Johnston <markj@FreeBSD.org>

An ongoing project aims to teach the swap pager to send SCSI UNMAP or
ATA TRIM commands to the swap device when a block of swap space has been
freed, for example when the application owning that block is exiting.

SSDs have become commonplace and feature low latency for random I/O
requests. This makes them appealing for use as swap devices, since lower
latencies mean that applications spend less time blocked while waiting
for a page-in from the swap device. To maximize write performance, some
SSDs require the operating system to send a notification to the disk
when a sector is no longer in use; this helps the disk optimize their
usage of NAND flash cells. In FreeBSD such a notification is called a
BIO_DELETE.

FreeBSD's UFS and ZFS filesystems have for a long time been able to
transmit BIO_DELETE requests to the devices backing the filesystem. For
example, for UFS this support is enabled by specifying -t in newfs(8) or
tunefs(8)'s parameters. However, FreeBSD has historically not had a
corresponding implementation for swap devices.

Thanks to Doug Moore, as of r349286 in -CURRENT and r349930 in stable/12
swapon(8) can send BIO_DELETE to all blocks on the specified device
immediately prior to configuring it as a swap device. This is enabled by
specifying -E in the swapon(8) parameters, or by adding the "trimonce"
option to the swap device's /etc/fstab entry. Some in-progress work on
the swap pager implements online block deletion, in which BIO_DELETE is
transmitted for blocks as they are freed by applications; this will
hopefully be implemented in FreeBSD 13.0.

SDIO is an interface designed as an extension to SD Cards to allow
attachments of various other peripherals, e.g., WiFi or Bluetooth.

Work has been ongoing by Ilya Bakulin on the MMCCAM stack to provide the
infrastructure to be able to have SD cards and SDIO devices attached
side-by-side facilitating FreeBSD's CAM framework. Based on this
excellent work over the last years, SDIO support was finished earlier
this year and committed to FreeBSD HEAD with the intention to merge to
12 at a later time.

Facilitating the newly available SDIO bus, work started to port
Broadcom's FullMAC WiFi driver. This work is still in progress and
expected to complete later this year. With this WiFi support for the
Raspberry Pi and other embedded boards will become available. Likewise
drivers for other SDIO devices can be developed now.

FUSE

Contact: Alan Somers <asomers@FreeBSD.org>

FUSE (File system in USErspace) allows a userspace program to implement
a file system. It is widely used to support out-of-tree file systems
like NTFS, as well as for exotic pseudo file systems like sshfs.
FreeBSD's fuse driver was added as a GSoC project in 2012. Since that
time, it has been largely neglected. The FUSE software is buggy and
out-of-date. Our implementation is about 11 years behind.

During Q2 I nearly finished the FUSE overhaul that I begain in Q1. I
raised the protocol level from 7.8 to 7.23, fixed many bugs (see 199934,
216391, 233783, 234581, 235773, 235774, 235775, 236226, 236231, 236236,
239291, 236329, 236379, 236381, 236405, 236327, 236466, 236472, 236473,
236474, 236530, 236557, 236560, 236647, 236844, 237052, 237181, 237588,
and 238565), and added the following features:

-   Optional kernel-side permissions checks (`-o default_permissions`)
-   Implement VOP_MKNOD, VOP_BMAP, and VOP_ADVLOCK
-   Allow interrupting FUSE operations
-   Support named pipes and unix-domain sockets in fusefs file systems
-   Forward UTIME_NOW during utimensat(2) to the daemon
-   kqueue support for /dev/fuse
-   Allow updating mounts with mount -u
-   Allow exporting fusefs file systems over NFS
-   Server-initiated invalidation of the name cache or data cache
-   Respect RLIMIT_FSIZE
-   Try to support servers as old as protocol 7.4

I also added the following performance enhancements:

-   Implement FUSE's FOPEN_KEEP_CACHE and FUSE_ASYNC_READ flags
-   Cache file attributes
-   Cache lookup entries, both positive and negative
-   Server-selectable cache modes: writethrough, writeback, or uncached
-   Write clustering
-   Readahead
-   Use counter(9) for statistical reporting

All that remains is to finish merging the branch, and deal with any
newly introduced bugs.

See the syzkaller entry in the 2019q1 quarterly report for an
introduction to syzkaller.

syzkaller continues to find FreeBSD kernel bugs. A number of such bugs
have been fixed in the past quarter, and we continue to investigate and
fix bug reports from syzkaller. Work to extend syzkaller's capabilites
has progressed: Andrew Turner has implemented support for fuzzing the
32-bit compatibility layer in amd64 kernels, helping illuminate some of
the darker corners of the kernel, and it is now possible to use bhyve as
a VM backend to syzkaller, so it is now efficient and convenient to fuzz
FreeBSD on FreeBSD.

Some planned work includes: enabling the use of ZFS as the base
filesystem for fuzzer VMs; extending the range of system calls and
ioctls covered by syzkaller; enabling LLVM sanitizers in the kernel so
as to catch more issues; and making use of netdump(4) to capture kernel
dumps for panics found by syzkaller, making it much easier to diagnose
bugs for which syzkaller was unable to find a reproducible test case.

Kernel zlib upgrade is in progress.

Xin (delphij@) and I have been working closely for zlib upgrade. We
relocated contrib/zlib to sys/contrib/zlib in order for kernel code to
access zlib in the tree. We also deleted dead code that depended on zlib
and inflate - inflate is a fork of unzip to uncompress gzip files. We
also renamed crc.h to avoid conflicts with zlib/crc.h.

Next goal is to compile both old zlib and new zlib into the kernel
allowing to switch each zlib user independently.

Linux compatibility layer update

Contact: Edward Tomasz Napierala <trasz@FreeBSD.org>

The project aims to improve the Linux compatibility layer, to make it
more compatible with recent Linux releases, and also to lower the bar
for potential developers who want to start contributing to it.

The initial effort focused on tooling, to make it easier to debug
problems and to prevent future regressions. The first part involved
making it possible to use Linux strace(1) utility and providing it as
linux-c7-strace package. The reason is that while FreeBSD truss(1) and
ktrace(1) can trace Linux binaries, they cannot decode Linux-specific
flags and structures.

The second part involved providing Linux Test Project binaries as
linux-ltp package. There is ongoing work to hook it up to the FreeBSD CI
infrastructure http://ci.FreeBSD.org.

There was also a number of improvements and fixes to bugs discovered in
the process. One of them (not yet committed) fixes binaries linked
against newer version of libc, effectively unbreaking binaries from
recent Ubuntu releases.

Lock-less delayed invalidation for amd64 pmap

Contact: Konstantin Belousov <kib@freebsd.org>

The Virtual Memory machine-dependent layer (pmap) on amd64 needs to
track all mappings for the managed physical memory pages, to be able to
either destroy all of them (for page-out), or change them from writeable
to read-only (e.g. to sync the page content to file, without racing with
modifications through user writes). The mappings are accounted by
creating pv_entry which records the address space (implicitly, by
linking the pv entry to pmap) and the virtual address of the mapping.

Previous work split the lock protecting the pv entries lists from other
VM locks into the pvh_global_lock lock, which was global for all address
spaces. You can see it in i386 pmap.c still. Later, hashed per-page pv
lists locks were introduced, which would reduce contention on pv lists
maninulations for different pages, but unfortunately the pvh_global_lock
was still needed to guarantee the safety of some operations.

Problem arises because amd64 pmap uses pmap lock to protect page tables
and TLB consistency, which is per-pmap locks different from pv lists
locks. When updating page table entry, we never drop pmap lock until the
necessary TLB invalidation is done globally, including signalling other
CPUs with IPI. But pv list locks can be unlocked before the necessary
invalidation is done. So for instance when pmap is asked to remove all
mappings of the specific page (pmap_remove_all(9)), it checks pv list of
the page to find the mappings. The list might appear empty despite other
CPUs TLB were not yet invalidated. If such page is reused, other CPUs
might change its content using cached TLB entries. Allowing that means
allowing both silent data corruption and opening security hole.

So the global pvh lock was held until all pmaps invalidated their TLBs.
This mechanism has obvious scalability issues, and instead a
generation-count based scheme for handling delayed invalidation (DI) was
developed, where each thread that might remove entry from pv list
acquired a generation number and marked the page with it, see
pmap_delayed_invl_page(9). Then, on e.g. pmap_remove_all(9) or
pmap_remove_write(9), pmap code waits for the maximum current thread's
invalidation generation number to pass the page's generation, which
guarantees that all required TLB invalidations are done.

Original implementation of DI allowed to get rid of pvh_global_lock, and
only used a private mutex to handle sequential queueing of the coming
and leaving threads, protecting a bounded region. A problem with that
appeared e.g. in scalability benchmarks which did massive parallel
unmaps, causing most of the threads to contend on DI queueing.

Current implementation of DI switched to lock-less queue algorithm using
the approach proposed by T.L. Harris and relying on double-CAS to
coalesce generation count and queueing. It uses ifuncs to select either
previous locked DI or current lock-less implementation, only old AMD
Athlons which did not implemented the CMPXCHG16B instruction falls to
the locked implementation by default. Lock-less implementation still
blocks the waiting thread on turnstile to avoid priority-inversion
issues, but practically the wait occur very rare, typical parallel
buildworld generates single-digit number of the events.

The patch got a lot of testing from Peter Holm, continuous reviews by
Mark Johnston while I worked out bugs and live-lock problems in the
implementation, and additional testing by Mateusz Guzik who helped to
identify a priority inversion bug with the wait.

Locking changes for vnodes during execve(2)

Contact: Konstantin Belousov <kib@freebsd.org>

The execve(2) family of syscalls replaces the executing image in the
current process. The file containing the program text, data, and
arbitrary other pre-initialized segments for the newly activated image
is usually called the text file. FreeBSD marks the text file as such,
the mark is mutually exclusive with any opening of the file for write.
In other words, file opened for write cannot be executed, and text file
cannot be opened for write.

During the execve(2) syscall processing, kernel needs to lock the text
file' vnode. This is done both to satisfy the VFS calls protocol, and to
ensure that there is no incompatible parallel changes occuring to the
text vnode. A vnode can be locked either in exclusive mode, which is
mutually incompatible with any other lock acquisition, or in shared
mode, which is only incompatible with exclusive requests, but allows
other shared owners.

In principle, there is no reason why would execve(2) need an exclusive
vnode lock, since it does not modify neither content nor metadata for
the text vnode. The only exception is the marking of the vnode as text,
which was done using VV_TEXT flag in v_vflag and protected by the vnode
lock. Since we modify v_vflag, the vnode lock protecting the
modification should be taken exclusive.

The end result is that execve(2)'s of the same file are serialized. For
instance, if user runs parallel build, which executes more than one job
for compiling, all invocation of the compiler are serialized during
execve(2).

The count of opens for write is contained in other struct vnode member
named v_writecount, which was protected by the vnode lock as well. Since
text is mutually exclusive with an open for write, I reused v_writecount
to indicate text references. Now, negative v_writecount counts the
number of text references. The v_writecount content is literally
protected by the vnode interlock, but normally all mutators also own
vnode lock at least in the shared mode.

This way, we no longer need to acquire exclusive text vnode lock during
execve(2), removing the serializing point. Additional positive effect is
that we started to account the precise number of text references on the
vnode. Before, we cleared VV_TEXT on the last unmap of the text vnode,
potentially allowing obscure DoS where mapping the text file while it is
executed prevented writes until the mapping is destroyed. Now we mark
the mappings for text explicitly in the vm_map_entry and dereference
v_writecount by +1 when such entry is unmapped.

NFSv4.2 client/server implementation for FreeBSD

  ----------------- ------------------------------------------------------
  Links             
  current sources   URL: https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/projects/nfsv42
  ----------------- ------------------------------------------------------

Contact: Rick Macklem <rmacklem@freebsd.org>

NFSv4.2 is a newer minor version of NFSv4, made up of a set of optional
operations/features. A majority of these operations are related to the
POSIX operations posix_fadvise(2), posix_fallocate(2) and lseek(2)'s
support for SEEKHOLE/SEEKDATA. There is also a Copy operation that
allows a byte range of a file to be copied to another file locally on
the NFS server, avoiding data transfer over the wire in both directions.
FreeBSD-current now has a Linux compatible copy_file_range(2) syscall
that will invoke this Copy operation on NFSv4.2 mounts. There is also
support for MAC labelling, but it requires changes to the RPCSEC_GSS
implementation to add V3 support and, as such, may not happen soon.

The implementation of NFSv4.2 (RFC-7862) is progressing nicely. At this
time, the LayoutError, IOAdvise, Allocate and Copy operations have been
implemented. There is still work to be done on Copy, to add asynchronous
support, so that large copies do not result in a long delay for the
RPC's reply.

The major operation that will be implemented next is Seek, so that
lseek(SEEKHOLE/SEEKDATA) will work for the NFSv4.2 mounts.

It is hoped that this implementation will be ready for
FreeBSD-current/head in time for the FreeBSD-13 release.

Testing is always appreciated and can be done by downloading the
modified kernel from the svn repository in base/rojects/nfsv42 and then
building and testing it on a couple of recent FreeBSD-current systems.

If anyone is conversant with Kerberos and wants to take on the challenge
of adding RPCSEC_GSS_V3 support to the kernel RPC, a patch that does
that would also be greatly appreciated.

NUMA awareness in the FreeBSD kernel

Contact: Jeff Roberson <jeff@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Andrew Gallatin <gallatin@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Mark Johnston <markj@FreeBSD.org>

A set of patches to improve the state of NUMA awareness in the FreeBSD
kernel are being developed and refined. This work also aims to generally
improve the performance of FreeBSD's memory management subsystem on
systems with many CPUs.

FreeBSD 12.0 featured a number of large changes which improve its
performance on systems with a non-uniform memory architecture. That is,
systems in which memory access latency for a given address varies
depending on the CPU. Another round of improvements is being developed
and will soon be available in FreeBSD-CURRENT. Short descriptions of
some of these patches follow; a few have already been committed to
FreeBSD-CURRENT.

In FreeBSD terminology, a memory page whose contents may not be evicted
is referred to as "wired." Pages may be wired under different
circumstances: for instance, all kernel memory is wired, and userland
applications may request that ranges of memory be wired using the
mlock(2) and mlockall(2) system calls. FreeBSD has historically defined
a system-wide limit on the number of wired pages so as to avoid
deadlocks that may arise when too much of a system's memory cannot be
reclaimed to satisfy new memory allocations. This limit was applied only
to userland wiring requests, but kernel wirings were counted against the
limit, so a large source of kernel wirings could cause mlock(2)
failures. This occurs frequently with a large ZFS ARC, for example. In
FreeBSD-CURRENT this limit has been changed such that only userland
wirings are counted against the limit; the kernel contains a number of
mechanisms to apply back-pressure to kernel memory usage, so the use of
a global limit on all wirings did not provide much benefit. This fixes a
common problem on large ZFS systems, and helps enable some other
architectural improvements to the code which manages page wirings.

FreeBSD has historically maintained two separate reference counters in
the structure which describes a single physical page of memory. These
counters initially had quite different properties, but have over time
become more and more similar. Some work to merge the two counters has
landed in FreeBSD-CURRENT. This does not have any user-visible effects,
but it simplifies the page management code and removes a large amount of
code which existed solely to transform references of one type to the
other. Such code also made use of heavily contended locks, so the
simplification improved kernel scalability for some workloads and has
enabled further scalability improvements.

UMA is the slab allocator used in FreeBSD's kernel. It is the backend
which services virtually all dynamic memory allocations performed in the
kernel. The first round of NUMA improvements added NUMA awareness to the
"keg" layer of UMA, which allocates and manages slabs. However, the
frontend of UMA, which provides several layers of caching for objects,
did not provide domain-aware caching, so over time the caches would
become "polluted" with objects from different memory domains. However,
this caching layer is being modified to ensure that objects from
different memory domains are partitioned, helping ensure that consumers
can perform domain-local allocations and frees efficiently. This will
enable a global "first-touch" allocation policy for UMA-managed objects.

During boot, the FreeBSD kernel allocates a number of static data
structures to track physical memory. These structures have historically
lived in the lowest available range of physical memory, so they many not
inhabit the same NUMA domain as the memory that they track. This is
suboptimal when one tries to affinitize a workload to a particular NUMA
domain: if while executing the workload the kernel frequently accesses
page structures for local memory, and the page structures themselves are
not placed in local memory, the kernel will perform many remote memory
accesses. Some in-progress work for the amd64 platform creates multiple
arrays of page tracking structures, one per NUMA domain, and ensures
that each array is local to its domain. This complicates the task of
initializing kernel data structures during boot, but can substantially
reduce the amount of cross-domain communication that occurs while the
kernel is performing useful work. Similarly, some patches to affinitize
per-CPU structures are being developed; while most per-CPU memory
allocations already return CPU-local memory, some structures allocated
during boot are not yet properly placed with respect to the accessing
CPU's memory domain.

Aberdeen Hackathon

At BSDCam in Cambridge last year we had a discussion to create a
template Hackathon in the same way we have a template for Devsummits. To
test out the idea I was convinced (I swear tricked is the correct word)
to host a Hackathon in Aberdeen.

As a project I think we benefit a lot from hackathons, but they do take
a little organisation. The worst part of this is dealing with getting
money from attendees so you can pay for events. I spoke with Deb Goodkin
from the foundation at BSDCam and we arranged to use their new
EventBrite based system to handle ticketing.

Overall this system made it straight forward for attendees to register
and get me their details and requirements. After the event the expenses
were then recouped from the foundation. This was much easier than me
putting together a custom system or even setting up and using EventBrite
myself.

The hackathon went well, you can read in Benedict and Kristof's reports
that follow, but it was less well attended than I originally expected.

For hackers planning future hackathons remember to take heed of common
national holidays (we could have planned the event to not land at
Easter) and expect major geopolitical events to make things
unpredictable (we knew Brexit would do something, but not when).

I need to thank the University of Aberdeen for providing the location
for the Hackathon and to encourage you to run a hackathon where you are.
The next one should be in your home town.

The hackathon in Aberdeen was happening in the week of Easter at the
University of Aberdeen. Although only Kristof Provost (kp@) and myself
joined our host Tom Jones, I still consider it a productive week for us.
The overall theme of the hackathon was networking and each of us
provided something towards that goal (be it PRs, submitting unfinished
work, or other bits and pieces). We got together the night of Tuesday,
April 16 over dinner and talked about what our plans were for the week.

Kristof and I had talked at AsiaBSDcon when I took his tutorial about
Testing in FreeBSD that we should add a chapter about it in the
developers handbook. We also used our first meeting to synchronize each
other about the latest news in FreeBSD from our developers viewpoint.

The next day, we met up at the Frazer Noble building where the hackathon
was taking place. It was one of the newer buildings on campus, nicely
integrated into the older houses of the city. Since we were only a
handful, we sat in Tom's office for the hackathon, which had plenty of
room. He also showed us the room where we are supposed to be having the
hackathon if we were more people and Tom gave us a little tour. Working
in a university myself, I'm always interested in how other education
organizations are structured and the rooms and equipment they provide
for learning. Overall, my impression was that there is a good amount of
space and equipment available, which we could have used in the
hackathon.

After returning, we decided to use a special tag in the commits we would
be doing to identify them as coming from this hackathon. We chose
"Event:" for it as it is a general enough term to be used at other
events like conferences, too. The "Sponsored by:" line we used in the
past is more for companies or individuals sponsoring certain features,
so I created a review to add this line to the committers guide.

Kristof had a couple of changes to the pf chapter in the FreeBSD
handbook for me, so I started going through those. I created a review
for him and the commit was made there and then, making use of the short
feedback cycle. Originally, we thought about bringing in people via
hangouts, but then resolved to contact people via our usual IRC channel
if we needed their input.

Kristof and Tom worked on some network specific stuff, whereas I started
work on creating an initial draft for the testing chapter. We would
occasionally start talking about something and then return to our work
in silence. If we needed to coordinate or had questions, we simply asked
and could continue once we got our answer. This provided a nice
atmosphere to work in. I tackled some doc PRs while Kristof found a bug
in pf and fixed it.

The afternoons were spent at different locations within walking
distance. Tom made sure we got a good impression on how it is to be a
student and that there is both taste and variety of food available. In
the evenings, Tom drove us into town to have dinner at various
restaurants over the week.

Aberdeen has a lot to offer as a city. Starting from the second day,
Kristof and I would meet up at my hotel, which was close to the Aberdeen
beach and walk along it to the University. According to Tom, it is
possible to see Dolphins when the weather is right and the gulf stream
provides the city with enough warmth that the winters aren't as bad as
you'd think this far up north.

Tom also gave us a tour of the zoological department of the university,
which offered a beautiful garden with various plants and trees, as well
as a museum with zoological specimen. This offered a great spot for
photographs and to unwind a bit from the technical discussions we've
had. Tom also had t-shirts made for the event, which are already rare
collectors items.

I had to return on Sunday, so Tom took us on a tour of the Scottish
highlands in his car the day before. We stopped at a couple of places to
take pictures and Tom would explain at lot to us having lived there all
his life. We came to Stonehaven and had fish and chips there from a
take-out restaurant that had a lot of awards for sustainable fishing.
This was certainly a highlight for the week and even then, we couldn't
stop talking about FreeBSD and networking.

Although more people would maybe have produced more output, the three of
us were certainly productive as a small group. It also made planning and
coordination easier and more flexible. Tom Jones had done a lot of
preparation and was an excellent guide. I would encourage him to host
another such hackathon in the future and hope that next time, more
people will take a trip to Aberdeen to spend some time hacking on
FreeBSD

Kristof Provost

While I’d been to Scotland before I’d never seen Aberdeen. It’s a
charming city, and I enthusiastically recommend visiting.

I arrived a little while after Benedict, but made it to my hotel easily,
and turned up in time to join Benedict and Tom for dinner.

Despite being small (or perhaps because of it), the hackathon was
remarkably productive. Benedict and I went through the pf documentation
in the handbook, so that Benedict could rework and improve it.
(Benedict’s doing the work, but I’m going to take credit anyway.)

Tom and I looked at the GSoC proposals and tried to find potential
mentors for two promising proposals. Both of us are candidate mentors as
well. We should know soon if our students are awarded slots.

Tom also proposed a patch to eliminate RFC 2675 IPv6 Jumbograms. It has
my enthusiastic support.

I managed to look at a couple of open pf issues:

-   pfctl’s interface_group() function checks if a name is an interface
    or an interface group. It still thought that interface names always
    ended with a number, but this assumption has been wrong for several
    years now. That’s fixed in r346370.
-   The DIOCRSETTFLAGS ioctl() misused copyin() (It held a lock calling
    it), which could result in panics.
-   That previous issue was actually discovered by my local instance of
    syzcaller, which I’d set up to add pf support to it. That support
    has now been merged, so we may see more issues detected by syzcaller
    soon.
-   Also for the DIOCRSETTFLAGS problem I extended the pf tests to check
    for this issue.
-   The pf tests will now fail if the pft_set_rules call fails to set
    the rules. That didn’t actually cause issues yet, but it’ll make
    debugging tests slightly easier, and they may catch more problems
    now.

On Saturday Tom took us out to discover some of the pretty bits of
Scotland. It turns out there are a lot of them. I can’t really do it
justice, but Tom has a promising career at the Scottish tourism board
when this computers fad blows over.

On my way home I passed through Oslo, and took the opportunity to meet
with (have lunch with) two of the EuroBSDCon local organisers.

Bring more Security Intelligence to FreeBSD

To bring more Security Intelligence we maintain the FreeBSD port of
zmaltail. This open source project based on Python can act as a sensor
and/or as a central server. It listens in defined ports or protocols and
compares IP addresses and domains against static and dynamic feeds,
contributed by the community.

As you can install this piece of software on multiple firewalls and let
them send to a central server, you are able to detect attacks and
compromises very fast. Within Q2 we updated the port to the latest
version and are constantly in contact with the core developer (also
co-author of SQLmap) to bring out new features.

The second project we are currently trying to add as a port is Wazuh.
Wazuh is a fork of Ossec which is already in the ports tree. Compared to
Ossec, Wazuh has some intelligent addition like full ELK-Stack
integration with own apps and dashboards.

With Wazuh installed on your webserver, or even on your windows desktop
you can monitor file integrity or log files for most kind of attacks.
Active response features let you e.g. send API calls to your firewalls
to dynamically block this offender.

As Wazuh offers a complete ELK-Stack you can use it also as a central
logging solution for better security insights into your network.

This project was sponsored by m.a.x. Informationstechnologie AG.

Add support for using QCOW in bhyve using the libvdsk library. Libvdsk
was used to substitute the regular disk operations from bhyve with a
call to libvdsk which will in turn call the disk-specific handler for
the operation.

To use this feature one has to install the libvdsk-enabled bhyve version
along with libvdsk from the libvdsk repo linked above.

New features added:

-   Extend libvdsk to make it easier to implement new formats
-   Improve read/write performance and stability
-   Add support for Copy-On-Write

Future tasks:

-   Integrate libvdsk in bhyve

nsysctl 1.0

Contact: Alfonso Sabato Siciliano <alfonso.siciliano@email.com>

The nsysctl utility is a /sbin/sysctl clone, to get or set the kernel
state, supporting libxo and extra options.

nsysctl [--libxo=opts [-r tagname]]
[-DdFGgIilmNpqTt[V|v[h[b|o|x]]]Wy]
[-e sep] [-B <bufsize>] [-f filename]
name[=value[,value]] ...
nsysctl [--libxo=opts [-r tagname]]
[-DdFGgIlmNpqTt[V|v[h[b|o|x]]]Wy]
[-e sep] [-B <bufsize>] -A|a|X

You could use nsysctl to explore the sysctl MIB showing the value and
the info of an object. The output is explicitly indicated by the options
and is printed via libxo in human and machine readable formats, moreover
some value is parsed to display it in a structured mode (e.g.,
vm.phys_free). The support for efi_map_header was added but it is
untested, someone could help by trying it via machdep.efi_map.

Please refer to the tutorial for a more thorough description.
