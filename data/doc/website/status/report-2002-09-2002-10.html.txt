Introduction:

Another busy pair of months at the FreeBSD Project have brought
substantial maturity and feature completeness to the fledgeling
5.0-CURRENT branch. And just in time too, because by the time you read
the next status report, we hope that you'll have FreeBSD 5.0 running on
your desktop! Over the past two months, we've seen an upgrade of sparc64
to Tier 1 (Fully Supported) status, integration of a high quality
storage encryption module, the commit of hardware-accelerated IPsec
support, the addition of a general-purpose "Device Daemon" to process
hardware attach/detach events to replace earlier single-purpose and
bus-specific daemons, the commit of RAIDFrame, and the improved maturity
of the TrustedBSD work. We've also seen another successful release of
the 4.x branch, 4.7-RELEASE, which will continue to be the production
supported platform as 5.X is brought in for landing.

Over the next two months, the FreeBSD Project will be focused almost
entirely on making 5.0 a success: improving system stability and
performance, as well as increasing the pool of applications that build
and run on 5.0. The Release Engineering team will have announced the 5.0
code freeze, and released DP2 by the time you read this. Following DP2
will be a series of Release Candidates (RC's), and then the release
itself. If you're interested in getting involved in the testing process,
please lend a hand -- a spare box and a copy of the DP and RC ISOs burnt
onto CD will make a difference. The normal caveats associated with
pre-release versions of operating systems apply! You may also be
interested in reading the Early Adopter's guide produced by the Release
Engineering team to help determine when a transition from the 4.x branch
to the 5.x branch will be appropriate for you and your organization.

Thanks,

Robert Watson, Scott Long

I'm very pleased to announce that another engineering release is
available for download at
http://www.geocities.com/m_evmenkin/ngbt-fbsd-20021104.tar.gz

This release features minor bug fixes and new OpenOBEX library port. The
snapshot includes support for H4 UART and H2 USB transport layers, Host
Controller Interface (HCI), Link Layer Control and Adaptation Protocol
(L2CAP) and Bluetooth sockets layer. It also comes with several user
space utilities that can be used to configure and test Bluetooth
devices. Also there are several man pages.

Service Discovery Protocol (SDP) port has been updated to version 0.8.
(ported from BlueZ-sdp-0.8). Most of the RFCOMM issues have been
resolved and now rfcommd works with Windows (3COM, Xircom and Widcomm)
and Linux stacks.

New supported USB device - EPoX BT-DG02 dongle. Also I have received
successful report about Mitsumi USB dongle and C413S Bluetooth enabled
cell phone (L2CAP and SDP works, waiting on RFCOMM report).

I'm currently working on OBEX server (Push and File Transfer profiles)
which will be based on OpenOBEX library (included in the snapshot).

Contact: Mike Barcroft <mike@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: FreeBSD-Standards Mailing List <standards@FreeBSD.org>

October 10, 2002 marked the one year anniversary of our project. During
that time we have made significant advances in FreeBSD's standards
conformance. FreeBSD 5.0-RELEASE will be the showcase for most of our
hard work. We hope that our tireless effort has had a positive effect on
FreeBSD and software vendors that maintain or are considering porting
their software to FreeBSD.

On the API front, _Exit(3) (an alias for _exit(2)) was added, sysconf(3)
was update for POSIX.1-2001, and some of the glob(3) additions were
MFC'd. The insque(), lsearch(), and remque() family of functions were
reimplemented and moved to libc from libcompat. Several wide character
functions were implemented, including all printf() and scanf() variants.
Finally, support for wide character format types (%C, %S, %lc, %ls) were
added to printf(3).

Work on utility conformance continued as getconf(1)'s compliance was
updated, c99(1) (a new version of c89(1)) was implemented, and cd(1) and
command(1) changes were MFC'd.

Almost 20 headers were brought up to conformance with applicable
standards. Not much work remains to fix conformance issues in the
remaining standard headers. Work in this area, as well as others, has
slowed down in preparation for 5.0-RELEASE.

DEVD Status Report

Contact: Warner Losh <imp@FreeBSD.org>

DEVD has been integrated into FreeBSD current. It was integrated in an
incomplete state. However, it is useful in the state that it is in for
doing simple things like running camcontrol rescan when a SCSI pcmcia
card is inserted, or running /etc/pccard_ether with an ethernet card is
inserted. The more sophisticated regular expression matching is not yet
complete. Devd only does actions on device arrival and departure, but
does not yet do anything with unknown devices. In addition to listening
for device events, there is some desire to have /dev/devctl also allow
for some direct control of the device tree.

Fast IPsec Status

Contact: Sam Leffler <sam@FreeBSD.org>

The main goal of this project is to modify the IPsec protocols to use
the kernel-level crypto subsystem imported from OpenBSD (see elsewhere).
A secondary goal is to do general performance tuning of the IPsec
protocols.

This work was committed to -current. To configure it for use specify
options FAST_IPSEC in your system configuration file. At present support
is limited to IPv4.

These last two months have seen quite a lot of GNOME activity. GNOME has
started releasing development snapshots of the upcoming GNOME 2.2
desktop. FreeBSD porting has begun outside of the main ports tree in the
MarcusCom CVS repository. If you are interested in testing the new
desktop, follow the instructions on the aforementioned cvsweb URL, and
checkout the "ports" module.

Evolution 1.2 is also close at hand. Ximian has posted its first release
candidate, 1.1.90, which has been ported to FreeBSD, and is available
from the MarcusCom CVS repo listed above. As soon as Ximian officially
releases Evolution 1.2, it will be placed in the FreeBSD ports tree.

The Mozilla ports have received numerous updates. We are now tracking
all three released Mozilla versions. The mozilla-vendor port is tracking
the 1.0.x branch, mozilla is tracking 1.1.x, and mozilla-devel is
tracking 1.2.x. The mozilla-devel port now has support for anti-aliased
fonts as well as a GTK+-2 interface

Finally, the GNOME team would like to welcome its newest team member,
Adam Weinberger. Adam has been submitting patches for both GNOME ports
as well as documentation. Currently, he has been active in the GNOME 2.2
porting effort. We are happy to have him.

Since the last status report the BSD Java Porting Team has continued to
make steady progress. The most exciting news we have is courtesy of our
newest team member, Alexey Zelkin of FreeBSD committer fame.

-   Thanks to a lot of hard work, primarily by Alexey, the project is
    very close to being able to release our first patch set for the 1.4
    JDK. Things are reportedly working quite well under -CURRENT, with
    -STABLE support being only marginally behind (thanks in part to the
    libc_r MFC by Max Khon).
-   The project has released another patchset for the 1.2.2 JDK, mainly
    to add support for OpenBSD and for JPDA. Most of the projects energy
    at the moment is focused on 1.3 and 1.4, however we still hope to
    back port relevant fixes if appropriate to 1.2.2.
-   Nate Williams has been hard at work behind the scenes migrating us
    to a new CVS server which has kindly been donated by the FreeBSD
    Foundation. The Project appreciates the continued support of the
    Foundation. Please support them so they can continue to support us
    and other important FreeBSD efforts!

FreeBSD/MIPS

Contact: Juli Mallett <jmallett@FreeBSD.org>

A mailing list was created, freebsd-mips, and a Perforce branch was
created in //depot/projects/mips. Changes which will be necessary to
allow multiple MIPS (and PowerPC) metaports to exist under one
architecture port were made, and are being pushed back into the main
FreeBSD tree. Some preliminary header work has been done, and porting
the ARCBIOS interfaces to the kernel has begun. The toolchain in tree
was updated and modified in places to support a FreeBSD/MIPS (Big
Endian) target, in the Perforce branch. Some early boot code has proven
the GDB MIPS simulator to work, for at least R3000 code, though whether
R3000 will be supported has been under discussion. Some initial
architectural decisions were also made, to steer current work.

FreeBSD/sparc64 Status Report

Contact: Jake Burkholder <jake@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Thomas Moestl <tmm@FreeBSD.org>

A lot has happened recently for the sparc64 port. Sysinstall and make
release work and can be used to build installable snapshots. The gdb5.3
port now works, and, thanks to Thomas Moestl, kernel crash dumps are
supported which can be analyzed by gdb. These 2 items are the last
things considered necessary by the Core team for FreeBSD/sparc64 to be a
Tier 1 architecture, which means that 5.0-RELEASE for sparc64 will be
officially supported by the release engineering team and by the security
officer team.

Recently Jake Burkholder has been working on alternate installation
methods other than bootable iso, including a mini-root filesystem which
can be written to the swap partition of an existing machine. Thomas
Moestl has been putting some finishing touches on the release process,
ensuring that the release documentation can be built properly, and that
the port readme files can be generated by the release process.

An experimental iso built with make release is now available on the
freebsd ftp site and mirrors in
/pub/FreeBSD/development/sparc64/5.0-20021031-SNAP. It is expected that
by the middle of November new 5.0-SNAP releases will be available every
few days for download and for ftp install, cpu power and bandwidth
permitting.

GBDE - Geom Based Disk Encryption

Contact: Poul-Henning Kamp <phk@FreeBSD.org>

GBDE has been committed to -current.

The "Geom Based Disk Encryption" module provides a mechanism for very
strong encryption of a GEOM "disk". The algorithm has passed informal
review by a couple of seasoned crypto heavy-weights. Any GEOM device can
be protected with GBDE, entire physical disks, MBR slices, BSD
partitions etc etc. Booting from an encrypted partition is not possible,
however.

The focus of GBDE is to protect a "cold" disk media. (FreeBSD is not
equipped well for protecting key material on a running system from being
compromised.) For a cold media, the only feasible attack on a GBDE
protected media is guessing the pass-phrase.

Summary of the GBDE multilevel protection scheme: Up to four separate
pass-phrases can unlock their own separate copies of the 2048 bit
masterkey. The master-keys are protected using AES/256/CBC keyed with a
SHA-2 hash derived from the pass-phrase. A salted MD5 hash over the
sectoroffset "cherry-picks" which masterkey bytes participate in the MD5
hash which generates the "kkey" for each particular sector. The kkey
AES/128/CBC encrypts the PRNG produced single-use key which AES/128/CBC
encrypts the actual sector data.

GBDE has features for master-key destruction and pass-phrase
invalidation.

See gbde(4) and gbde(8) for more details.

This software was developed for the FreeBSD Project by Poul-Henning Kamp
and NAI Labs, the Security Research Division of Network Associates, Inc.
under DARPA/SPAWAR contract N66001-01-C-8035 ("CBOSS"), as part of the
DARPA CHATS research program.

Contact: Poul-Henning Kamp <phk@FreeBSD.org>

The GEOM code is now the default on most (if not all ?) architectures
and the few remaining issues in libdisk/sysinstall is being hashed out.

Although we are far from finished developing GEOM, its current feature
set is a significant step forward for FreeBSD, providing not only
immediate relief for new architectures (sparc64, ia64 etc) but also
because it is designed as SMPng code from the start.

Hardware Crypto Support Status

Contact: Sam Leffler <sam@FreeBSD.org>

The goal of this project is to import the OpenBSD kernel-level crypto
subsystem. This facility provides kernel- and user-level access to
hardware crypto devices for the calculation of cryptographic hashes,
ciphers, and public key operations. The main clients of this facility
are the kernel RNG (/dev/random), network protocols (e.g. IPsec), and
OpenSSL (through the /dev/crypto device).

This work was committed to the -current tree. To configure it for use
specify device crypto in your system configuration file or you can load
the crypto module. The /dev/crypto device support is brought in with
device cryptodev or by loading the cryptodev module. Two crypto device
drivers exist: ubsec for Broadcom-based PCI hardware and hifn for
Hifn-based PCI hardware.

Integration of this work into the -stable source tree should be
completed by the time this report is published.

Packages of KDE 3.0.4 were released and the FreeBSD Ports were updated.

Preparing for KDE 3.1 conducted by Will Andrews: A lot of effort was

Contact: Daniel Eischen <deischen@FreeBSD.org>

The KSE code has now all the basic kernel functionality to start being
used by the userland. There are still things to be done for testing and
familiarization.

General system utilities have not yet been changed. e.g. ps and top etc.
need to know about threads.

There is quite a lot of code in the kernel that still assumes that there
is one thread in a process. Signals are not yet handled in the final
manner (though they are delivered to a random thread in the process :-/
).

The system calls and datastructures are now however in place. The test
program successfully starts several threads that can be scheduled on
different processors, and closes them down again. The userland is
probably going to be able to do simple scheduling of pthread threads
using KSE by the time that this report is published.

I still need someone to take over the "official" web page since jason
left. LaTeX sure isn't my thing.

Not much since the last status report, except that we now have the repo
and development web page back online, thanks to the services of John De
Boskey who freely provided the necessary hardware and bandwidth to host
the project. We have also ported LibH to GCC 3.x, so that it can compile
on -CURRENT correctly. This, however, broke tvision, which doesn't
compile under GCC 3.x, so we moved to rhtvision but this caused linking
problems so we're stuck with no console front end, for now.

Work on a Hui rewrite and SWIG bindings stalled. Alex was able to come
up with a simple patch to make the ports system use LibH's pkg_create
script to build libh packages, so we're getting closer to a real
pkg_create(1) drop-in replacement. I rewrote the milestone list to show
a bit more relevant and encouraging tasks that will be dealt with in
order to really push LibH forward.

NEWCARD Status Report

Contact: Warner Losh <imp@FreeBSD.org>

Work on newcard continues. A number of bugs have been fixed in the last
few months. You are now able to load and unload drivers (including the
bridge) to test changes to pccard and/or cardbus bus code. It is now
possible to load a driver that has a pccard attachment and have a
previously inserted card probe and attach. This is also true for
CardBus. A number of issues remain to be solved before 5.0. However,
with the integration of devd into the tree nearly all of old
functionality of OLDCARD is now present in NEWCARD (the biggest
remaining parts are power control for the sockets, as well as pccardc
dumpcis).

Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) are 128 bit values that may be
generated independently on separate nodes (hosts), which result in
globally unique strings. UUIDs are also known as Globally Unique
Identifiers (GUIDs). The UUID support for FreeBSD (libc) conforms to the
DCE 1.1 RPC specification.

UUID support has been added to FreeBSD -CURRENT, and will be available
in version 5.0. It is being extensively used in GPT partition handling
for IA-64 platform. For now, a simple manual page has been provided,
which outlines information about the provided uuid routines. Many
documentation additions and enhancements to uuidgen(1) are in the

The Release Engineering (RE) team completed and released FreeBSD 4.7 on
10 October 2002. This release features updates for a number of
contributed software programs in the base system, as well as all of the
security and bug fixes from FreeBSD 4.6.2. The next release in the 4.X
series will be FreeBSD 4.8, which has a scheduled release date of 1
February 2003.

Before that time, however, will be the release of FreeBSD 5.0. Thus far,
we have not been able to release the 5.0-DP2 developer snapshot due to
various stability issues. Thanks to much effort from many of our fellow
developers, we believe that most of these have been resolved. The RE
team wishes to emphasize that FreeBSD 5.0 will involve new code and
features that have not seen widespread testing, and that more
conservative users may wish to continue to track the 4.X series for the
near-term future. To provide more information on these issues, we have
added an Early Adopter's Guide to the release documentation for 5.0.

Brian Somers has resigned from the RE team due to increased time
pressures. We thank him for all of his help with FreeBSD 4.5, 4.6,
4.6.2, and 4.7, and we hope to continue working with him as a fellow
developer.

Scott Long has graciously offered to help improve the communication
between the RE team and the rest of the developer community. We greatly
appreciate his assistance.

Most progress on TrustedBSD over the last two months related to
improving the maturity of the ACL and MAC implementations, and merging
new aspects of those features into the primary FreeBSD CVS Repository
for inclusion in FreeBSD 5.0. This included fixes to run better on
sparc64, improved tuning of what system objects are mediated, locking
fixes and optimizations especially relating to the vnode and pipe
implementations, improved support for MAC labeling on symlinks, support
for asynchronous process label changes as required in some locking
situations, remove use of "temporary labels" and prefer use of object
type specific labels reducing redundant and/or confusing label
management code in policies, improve avoidance of memory allocation in
M_NOWAIT scenarios for socket allocation in the syncache, mediation of
link operations, race condition fixes for devfs involving label
creation, improve handling of VM events such as mmaping, improve
mediation of socket send/receive events (as distinguished from socket
transmit/deliver events), support for manipulating EAs on symlinks using
new system calls, support for MNT_ACLS and MNT_MULTILABEL flags at mount
time, as well as FS_ACLS and FS_MULTILABEL superblock flags to key
useful defaults using tunefs, correction of a memory leak in the UFS ACL
code, enable UFS ACL support by default in GENERIC, mediation points for
file creation, deletion, and rename, support for a mac_execve()
execution interface in the style of SELinux's execve_secure() permitting
a label transition request as part of the exec operation for policies
that support it, more consistent handling of NFS lookups, support for
labeling of multicast encapsulated packets, ATM packet labeling, FDDI
packet labeling, STF packet labeling, revised label interface that
avoids userland parsing of per-policy elements, reducing us to a single
instance of parsing and printing for each policy (and further
abstracting policy implementation details from the library code).

Also, change to single-level sockets for Biba and MLS policies, support
for partial label updates for Biba and MLS, addition of mac.9 man page,
revised user API system calls, implementation of mac_get_pid(), and
various other related bits, creation of mac.conf(5) to specify label
defaults, checks for various system operations including swapon(),
settime(), and sysctl(), reboot(), acct(), introduction of command line
utilities for maintaining file and process labels, support for user
labels tied to login class, su support for label changes, ifconfig
support for interface labels, ps support for process labels, ls support
for file labels, ftpd support for login labels, development of the Biba
and MLS notions of privilege, and a move to C99 sparse structure
initialization, restoring full type checking for policy entry points.

Wireless Networking Status

Contact: Sam Leffler <sam@FreeBSD.org>

The goal of this project is to improve the wireless networking support
in the system. The initial work will incorporate the 802.11 link layer
done by Atsushi Onoe for NetBSD. This core support code implements the
basic 802.11 protocols required for Station and AP operation in BSS,
IBSS, and Ad Hoc modes of operation. Wireless device drivers will then
be revised to use this common code instead of their private
implementations.

Following this initial stage the wireless networking support will be
extended to support functionality needed for workgroup, enterprise, and
metropolitan (e.g. mesh) networking environments. This will include full
power management support, the 802.1D spanning tree protocol for running
multiple AP's in a bridged configuration, QoS support, and enhanced
security protocols (LEAP, AES, EAP). Support for new hardware devices is
also planned.
