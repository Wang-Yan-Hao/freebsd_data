Introduction

This report covers FreeBSD development activities from February, 2002
through April, 2002. It's been a busy few months -- BSDCon in San
Francisco, the FreeBSD Developer Summit, a first development preview of
5.0-CURRENT, not to mention lots of progress on the 5.0 feature set
(SMPng, sparc64, GEOM, ... the list goes on).

In the next two months, the USENIX ATC occurs (highly recommended event
for both developers and users), and a number of new software components
will hit the tree, including UFS2 and the TrustedBSD MAC framework.
We'll also complete the elections for the FreeBSD Core Team, and should
have the next Core Team online by the time the next report rolls around.
Stay tuned for more!

  Old concept paper here.   URL: http://www.FreeBSD.org/~phk/Geom/

Contact: Poul-Henning Kamp <phk@FreeBSD.org>

The GEOM code has gotten so far that it beats our current code in some
areas while still lacking in others. Work continues on a generalized
interface for "magic data" (boot blocks, disklabels MBR's etc)
manipulation from userland.

With GEOM enabled in the kernel any FreeBSD platform will now recognize
PC style MBR's, i386 disklabels, alpha disklabels, PC98 extended MBRs
and SUN/Solaris style disklabels.

Athlon MTRR Problems

Contact: David Malone <dwmalone@FreeBSD.org>

The FreeBSD MTRR code has been made more robust against unexpected
values sometimes found in the Athlon's Memory Type Range Registers.
Problems with these values had prevented XFree 4.2 running on some
motherboards. Experimentation indicates that these undocumented values
may control the mapping of BIOS/ROMs or have something to do with SMM.
If anyone can provide details of what these values mean, can they please
let me know, so the MTRR code can be completed.

Bluetooth stack for FreeBSD (Netgraph implementation)

Contact: Maksim Yevmenkin <m_evmenkin@yahoo.com>

I'm slowly making progress. The second engineering release is available
for download at
http://www.geocities.com/m_evmenkin/ngbt-fbsd-20020506.tar.gz

This release includes support for H4 UART transport layer, Host
Controller Interface (HCI), Link Layer Control and Adaptation Protocol
(L2CAP) and Bluetooth sockets layer. It also comes with several user
space utilities that can be used to configure and test Bluetooth
devices.

I'm currently working on RFCOMM protocol implementation (Serial port
emulation over Bluetooth link). My next goal is to port Service
Discovery Protocol (SDP) implementation from BlueZ
(http://bluez.sf.net). I'm also thinking about adding USB device support
(as soon as i find/buy hardware).

Issues: 1) Bluetooth hardware; I have couple PC-CARDs that i use for
development and testing purposes, but i'd love to have more. 2) Time; My
regular day job kicked in, so i will be spending more time doing stuff
i'm getting paid for.

Since the last progress report, the initialization code was much cleaned
(thanks to NetBSD's acort32 port) and partial DDB support as been added.
I'm now struggling to put the pmap module into a working state. The
latest patch set only includes the initialization changes. I did some
tries to get what I had so far working on my iPAQ without much successes
(downloading a kernel over a serial link is way too painful). If anyone
has had success in getting any iPAQ to work as a USB storage device
under *BSD please contact me.

  ------- -------------------------------------------

Contact: Mike Barcroft <mike@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: FreeBSD-Standards Mailing List <standards@FreeBSD.org>

Since the last status report, two developers working on utility
conformance were given commit access to the FreeBSD CVS repository to
help expedite development. As a result, the following utilities have
been brought up to conformance, they include: csplit(1), env(1),
expr(1), fold(1), join(1), m4(1), mesg(1), paste(1), patch(1), pr(1),
uuencode(1), uuexpand(1), and xargs(1). The printf(1) utility was
brought up to conformance with the 1992 edition of POSIX.2, with further
development planned.

On the header front, much progress has been made. Specifically,
infrastructure to control visibility of components of a header, based on
the standard requested by an application, has been added to
<sys/cdefs.h>. Some work has been completed on renovating the way types
are defined. This has lead to the creation of <sys/_types.h>. Further
improvements such as the merger of <machine/ansi.h> and
<machine/types.h> are planned. Additionally, the headers: <strings.h>,
<string.h>, and <sys/un.h> have been made to conform to POSIX.1-2001.

On the API front, scanf(3) has received support for 5 new length
modifiers (hh, j, ll, t, and z). A patch to implement two additional
conversion specifiers (j and z) has been developed for printf(9) and is
expected to be committed soon.

In other news, the project's web site has been moved to the main FreeBSD
site. It is now available at the URL at the top of this status report.

The second FreeBSD Developer Summit, held following the BSD Conference
in San Francisco in February, was a great success. Around 40 developers
attended in person, another five by phone, and many others by webcast.
During a marathon-esque eight hour session, a variety of development
topics were discussed, including adding inheritance to the KOBJ system,
ports to new architectures, adaptations of the toolchain for new
architectures, the GEOM extensible storage device framework, upcoming
changes to the network stack, TrustedBSD features, KSE, SMPng, and the
release engineering schedule. This event was sponsored by DARPA and NAI
Labs, with webcasting provided by Joe Karthauser, bandwidth provided by
Yahoo!. Planning for future such events is now underway; a
summary/transcript of discussion may be found at the URL above.

FreeBSD Package-building Cluster

Contact: Kris Kennaway <kris@FreeBSD.org>

Packages are built from the FreeBSD Ports Collection on a cluster of
i386 and alpha machines using scripts available in
/usr/ports/Tools/portbuild/. Over the past few months I have been
cleaning up and extending these scripts to improve efficiency and allow
for greater flexibility in how package builds are performed. Major
improvements so far have been: cleaning up and modularizing the scripts
to avoid code duplication and reduce the need for ongoing maintenance;
optimizing the build process and making it much more robust against
client machine failure; and allowing package builds to be restarted if
they are interrupted. The i386 package cluster is currently running
FreeBSD 5.0-CURRENT, and it has proven to be a useful testing ground for
exposing kernel bugs, especially those which only manifest under system
load.

Future plans include the ability to perform incremental package rebuilds
which only build packages that have changed since the last run. This
will allow packages to be made available on the FTP site within an hour
or two of the CVS commit to the ports collection. We also hope to set up
a sparc64 package cluster in the near future, but this is contingent on
suitable hardware.

  ------- --------------------------------------------------

Contact: Nicholas Souchu <nsouch@FreeBSD.org>

FreeBSD/KGI started last year after the port of GGI to VGL. KGI (Kernel
Graphic Interface) is a kernel infrastructure providing user
applications with access to hardware graphic resources (dma, irqs,
mmio). KGI is already available under Linux as a separate project. The
FreeBSD/KGI project aims at integrating KGI in the FreeBSD kernel.
Mostly a port for now, but optimized for FreeBSD in the future.
Currently FreeBSD/KGI is under development and the code is only
available for reading, compiling but not running. More interesting are
design hints found at the project URL.

GCC 3.1

Contact: David O'Brien <obrien@FreeBSD.org>

As of Thur May 9th, 2002 FreeBSD 5-CURRENT is now using a GCC 3.1
prerelease snapshot as the system C compiler. At this time of cutting
over, the compiler is working well on i386, Alpha, Sparc64, and IA-64
for building world. There is a known problem with our atomic ops on
Alpha that prevents a GCC 3.1 built kernel from booting.

Currently the C++ support libraries (libstdc++, et.al.) does not build
and thus prevents the system C++ compiler from being used.

  FreeBSD GNOME Project homepage.   URL: http://www.FreeBSD.org/gnome
  --------------------------------- -----------------------------------

Contact: Joe Marcus <marcus@FreeBSD.org>

The GNOME project has seen quite a few changes lately. For one, the
author of this update has recently been given "The Bit." Joe Marcus
Clarke now has CVS access, and is working primarily on the GNOME
project. Joe has been closing a good deal of GNOME PRs, as well as
patching some of the existing GNOME 1.4 components.

The GNOME 2 porting effort continues on. We have completed porting of
the GNOME 2.0 API, and are 75% complete on porting the full GNOME 2.0
desktop. When complete, GNOME 1.4 and GNOME 2.0 will be co-resident in
the ports tree. Both APIs can be installed concurrently in the same
PREFIX, but the respective desktops will remain mutually independent.
Maxim Sobolev is working on adapting bsd.gnome.mk to handle both
versions of the desktop in an elegant fashion.

Not to be left out, the existing GNOME 1.4 components have received
numerous updates to keep them in sync with the stable distfiles on
gnome.org. We have seen many "1.0" milestone releases including the most
recent AbiWord 1.0.0. In the next few weeks, we will be making sure all
the GNOME 1.4 components build correct packages on bento so that GNOME
1.4 will be on the 4.6-RELEASE CD.

IA64 Port

Contact: Peter Wemm <peter@FreeBSD.org>

IA64 has had a busy few months. Aside from gcc, we are now fully self
hosting on IA64. Doug Rabson has performed his magic and implemented the
execution of 32 bit i386 application binaries although more work remains
to be done to make ld-elf.so.1 happy with the different underlying page
size. We have been using the i386 perforce binary to do actual
development work and submit from the ia64 systems themselves. Marcel
Moolenaar has been working on SMP and machine-check support. We have
been running SMP kernels amazingly reliably on our development boxes for
quite some time now. syscons is now functional. We have produced a
self-booting run-root-on-cdrom ISO image (idea taken from the sparc64
folks) that has been used to manually self install an IA64 system from a
blank disk. Aside from a few minor loose ends we now have complete 'make
world' functionality. sysinstall works on ia64. We plan on producing a
semi-respectable boot/install cdrom image shortly.

Contact: Gordon Tetlow <gordont@gnf.org>

Mike Makonnen has done quite a bit of excellent work on porting the
scripts from FreeBSD into the NetBSD framework. The next step seems to
be to try to reduce the amount of diffs between our implementation and
the original set from NetBSD.

          URL: http://www.FreeBSD.org/~dwhite/ipmi/
  ------- -------------------------------------------

Contact: Doug White <dwhite@FreeBSD.org>

IPMI Tools for FreeBSD is a collection of C and Python applications and
modules for exploring the information available via the Intelligent
Platform Management Interface (IPMI), as implemented on server
motherboards by Intel and HP. IPMI is an open standard with patent
protection for adopters which defines standard interfaces to on-board
management hardware. The management hardware consists of a CPU, sensors
such as temperature probes and fan speeds, and repositories such as the
System Event Log and Field-Replaceable Unit (FRU) inventory, and other
system information.

A basic set of tools was recently made available which uses the KCS and
SMIC system interfaces to retrieve the System Event Log, FRU repository,
and system sensors. Additional features are currently under research.
Suggestions for additional features and programs are greatly
appreciated.

KAME Project has been extended until March 2004, and we decided the
project roadmap for these two years. The first one year is for
implementation, and the remaining year is for feedback of our results
into other BSD projects (please refer to the above URL for further
detail). Great change is lack of NAT-PT support due to a lack of human
resource, although KAME snap still contains it as it is.

SUZUKI Shinsuke (suz@kame.net) has begun working for KAME and FreeBSD
merge task in cooperation with Umemoto-san (ume@FreeBSD.org). Some of
KAME stuff (critical bug fix, newest ports for pim6sd and racoon, etc)

Contact: Jonthan Mini <mini@FreeBSD.org>

The KSE project had floundered due to lack of development time for
awhile, but has been picked up recently by Jonathan Mini. Currently, the
main focus is to prepare the "milestone 3" code for inclusion into
-CURRENT.

The project is still working towards "milestone 4" (allowing threads
from the same process to run on multiple CPUs), which should be
significantly easier now due to work done by the SMPng project over the
past several months.

Help could be used in several areas of the project, especially with
porting the libc_r (pthreads) library to KSE's threading model.

Contact: Nathan Ahlstrom <nra@FreeBSD.org>

We now have a loadable mfsroot floppy. It contains just the diskeditor
(which is really a disk partitioner) which has been enhanced and is
probably in its final form. It's been geared towards making the newfs(1)
and mount(1) steps separate dialogs, so it reduceed its complexity. A
basic fstab class has been implemented to manipulate /etc/fstab and
mountpoint. This might find a use outside libh, by the way. Libh package
format is still incomplete and somehow buggy, so it's my next target.

There is a API documentation effort underway with the help of
doxygen(1), so there's now more documentation for people that want to
get started with libh.

All this lead me to prepare the release of another alpha preview of libh
that will shortly be available in the ports collection (0.2.2). Also, a
new committer (okumoto) has joined the project (as well as I) and he is
currently working on cleaning up the build system. It's been a few
months without news, so this probably seemed a bit long, but don't
worry, we still need your help to really get this going!

Version 1.1 for FreeBSD-current is now available. It includes the
SNMP-daemon package bsnmp, the driver package ngatmbase, the UNI4.0
signaling package ngatmsig and the network emulation package ngatmnet.
NgAtm allows both to build applications running directly on top of ATM
and to use ATM-Forum LAN emulation to use IP over ATM. Currently we are
working on a simple switch module, that implements the network side
signaling and ILMI as well as simple routing and call admission control.

Network interface cloning and modularity

Contact: Brooks Davis <brooks@FreeBSD.org>

Support for stf(4), faith(4), and loopback interfaces has been committed
to current. The stf and faith support has been MFC'd. In current the API
has changed to move unit allocation into the generic cloning code
reducing the amount of support code required in each driver. Code
improvements to increase our API compatibility with NetBSD will be
committed soon along with cloning support for discard interfaces and
ppp(4) interfaces.

Thanks to mux@FreeBSD.org for the loopback support and unit allocation
cleanups.

The patch for the new mount API has now been committed to the tree.
Several filesystems also have been converted to this new mount API,
namely procfs, linprocfs, fdescfs and devfs. I'm working on converting
more filesystems to nmount, and actually already have UFS done. It has
not been committed yet to avoid conflicting with the UFS2 work, but it
should hit the tree soon. Manpages are still missing at the moment
because I had to modify the API slightly. I hope to have them done soon
now.

The painful parts are now completed, with all authentication- related
utilities converted to PAM (except for those cases where it doesn't make
sense, like Kerberos- or OPIE-specific commands). OpenPAM is complete
(except for a few missing man pages) and seems to work well.

For more details, see the activity reports linked to above.

The PowerPC port is moving ahead. It can now mount a root file system
and exec init, but fails when trying to map init's text segment in. I'm
hoping to have it starting my fake "Hello, world!" init soon, after
which I plan to try and get some libc bits in place so that I can build
/bin and /sbin and try to get to actual single-user.

ppp RADIUS/MS-CHAP support

Contact: Brian Somers <brian@FreeBSD.org>

libradius now supports RADIUS vendor attribute extensions and user-ppp
is now capable of doing MS-CHAP authentication via a RADIUS server. A
new net/freeradius port has been created for support of MS-CHAP in a
RADIUS server.

MS-CHAPv2 support will be added soon.

The work is sponsored by Monzoon.

The release engineering team released FreeBSD 5.0-DP1 on 8 April 2002.
This Developer Preview gives developers and other interested parties a
chance to help test some of the new features to appear in 5.0-RELEASE.
This distribution has known bugs and areas of instability, and should
only be used for (non-production) testing and development.

The next releases of FreeBSD will be 4.6-RELEASE (scheduled for 1 June
2002) and 5.0-DP2 (scheduled for 25 June 2002). Information on the
release schedules and more can be found on the team's new area on the
FreeBSD Web site (see the URL above).

Finally, the team has gained two new members: Brian Somers and Bruce A.
Mah.

SMPng

Contact: <smp@FreeBSD.org>

The SMPng project has been picking up steam in the last few months
thankfully. In February, Seigo Tanimura-san committed the first round of
process group and session locking. Alfred Perlstein also added locking
to most of the pipe implementation. In March, Alfred fixed several
problems with the locking for select() and pushed down Giant some in
several system calls. Andrew Reiter added locking for kernel module
metadata, and Jeff Roberson wrote a new SMP-friendly slab allocator to
replace both the zone allocator and the in-kernel malloc(). The use of
the critical section API was cleaned up to not be abused as replacements
for disabling and enabling interrupts. Also, Matt Dillon optimized the
MD portion of the critical section code on the i386 architecture.
Several other subsystems were also locked in April as well. See the
SMPng website and todo list for more details.

Some of the current works in progress include locking for the kernel
linker by Andrew Reiter and light-weight interrupt threads for the i386
by Bosko Milekic. Seigo Tanimura-san, Alfred Perlstein, and Jeffrey Hsu
are also working on locking down various pieces of the networking stack.
Alan Cox has started working on fixing the existing locking in the VM
subsystem and moving bits of it out from under Giant. John Baldwin has
written an implementation of turnstiles as well as adaptive mutexes in
the jhb_lock Perforce branch. The adaptive mutexes appear to be stable
on i386, alpha, and sparc64, but the turnstile code still contains
several tricky lock order reversals. John also plans to commit the
p_canfoo() API change to use td_ucred in the very near future and then
finish the task of making ktrace(4) use a worker thread.

Over the past couple of months, progress has pretty much stopped until
very recently. The past few changes to the audit code were update the
usage of zones to UMA zones, cleanup some old cruft, and start toying
with the idea of having an audit write thread implemented as an ithd.
The next step is to decide two realistic approaches to the where the
records will be dumped -- whether that is to a local disk or fed up to
userland and then dealt with. After that, the goal will be to expand the
number of events that are being audited, while also working in some
performance testing procedures. I will be posting to trustedbsd-audit
about the recent changes shortly.

Over the last three months, there has been a lot of activity in the
TrustedBSD MAC tree. An initial commit of the SEBSD code (NSA FLASK and
SELinux implementation) was made; many MAC policies previously linked
directly to the kernel via kernel options were moved to kernel modules;
the flexibility of the framework was improved relating to the life cycle
of object labels; additional labeling and access control hooks were
introduced; new policies were introduced to demonstrate the flexibility
of the framework (including a cleanup of inter-process authorization,
additional VFS hooks, improved support for multilabel filesystems,
network booting, IPv6, IPsec, support for "peer" labels on stream
sockets). Current modules include Biba integrity policy, MLS
confidentiality policy, Type Enforcement, "BSD Extended" (permitting
firewall-like rulesets for filesystem protection), "ifoff" (limit
interface communication by policy), mac_seeotheruids (limit visibility
of processes/etc of other users), "babyaudit" (a simple audit
implementation), and SEBSD (FLASK/SELinux port).

Over the next month, a final move to completely dynamic labeling will be
made, permitting policies to introduce new state relating to process
credentials, vnodes, sockets, mounts, interfaces, and mbufs at run-time,
allowing a broad range of flexible label-driven policies to be
developed. In addition, application APIs will be re-designed and
re-implemented so as to better support a fully dynamic policy framework.
We plan to make an initial prototype patchset available for review in
June, with the intent of committing that patchset in mid-June.

Updated prototype code may be retrieved from the TrustedBSD CVS trees on
cvsup10.FreeBSD.org.

UMA

Contact: Jeff Roberson <jeff@FreeBSD.org>

FreeBSD's new kernel memory allocator has been committed to 5.0. UMA is
a slabs derived allocator that supports memory reclaiming, object
caching, type stable storage, and per CPU free lists for optimal SMP
performance. It has both a malloc(9) interface and a zone style
interface for specific object types. uma(9) will be available shortly.

Read-only support for UDF filesystems was checked into the 5-CURRENT
branch in April. Backporting for 4-STABLE is being conducted by Jeroen.
The next phase is to write a newfs_udf, then move on to adding write
support to the filesystem. I'm still looking for a volunteer to handle
read and write support for write-once media (e.g. CD-R).

Contact: Ken Merry <ken@FreeBSD.org>

I have released a new zero copy sockets snapshot, the first since
November, 2000. The code has been ported up to the latest -current, and
the jumbo code now has mutex protection. Also, zero copy send and
receive can be selectively turned on and off via sysctl to make it
easier to compare performance with and without zero copy. Reviews and
comments are welcome.
