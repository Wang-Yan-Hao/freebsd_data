Thanks to support from Cisco Systems, Inc, the port of the DTrace
dynamic tracing framework from OpenSolaris to FreeBSD is active again. A
solution to the integration issues surrounding the CDDL and BSD licenses
has been found. There is an entirely BSD licensed set of hooks/shims
which are optionally compiled into the kernel. This option can be
included in the GENERIC kernel and shipped without any CDDL patent
encumberance. The CTF (Compact C Type Format) tools now work across all
architectures enabled in a 'make universe'. A BSD licensed DWARF library
has been developed. The kernel DTrace support is limited to amd64 and
i386 at the moment. It currently passes 822 of the tests in the DTrace
Test Suite. It is expected that the initial commit to FreeBSD-CURRENT
will occur within the next month after review. Refer to the change
summary page for details of the proposed changes.

The FreeBSD Installer project (FIN) is yet another attempt to replace
the aging sysinstall(8). I am attempting to keep the best parts of
sysinstall(8) and combine them with the framework provided by the
BSDInstaller (bsdinstaller.org) to create an installation program for
FreeBSD that is multi-lingual, supports multiple installation media,
supports remote installation, and is easily extensible to other
installation types (gui, cgi, etc). The current implementation will
slice disks, install your choice of base distributions, and set hostname
and root password.

Open tasks:

1.  Setting date, time, and time zone information
2.  Choosing and installing packages
3.  Support for installation media other than IDE CD-Rom (HTTP, FTP,
    etc)
4.  Integration with devel/gettext

As part of my thesis, I've been working on a framework to monitor the
performance of CURRENT over time. The project is now in a state where a
server and a slave are producing benchmark results and publishing the
results to a web page for testing. Already, the setup has detected
regressions. Lots of improvements can be made, but it is already quite
useful. Over the next month I'll be adding a few features, fixing bugs
and writing documentation.

Open tasks:

1.  Decide on a useful set of benchmarks
2.  Find a more permanent home for the database and webserver
3.  Go live

The TrustedBSD Project was proud to release OpenBSM 1.0, the first
production release of OpenBSM, which is shipped with FreeBSD 6.3 and
will ship with FreeBSD 7.0. This release represents largely polishing,
bug fixing, and cleanup over the previous alpha release, but for FreeBSD
6.x introduced features such as XML audit trail printing, new token
types, and new event identifiers.

A variety of development work continues on audit, including initial work
on OpenBSM 1.1 alpha, work on improving the performance and semantics of
audit pipes, and the experimental bsmtrace host intrusion detection
package.

Open tasks:

1.  Improve performance for live intrusion detection by introducing
    additional buffering and multi-record copying for audit pipes.
2.  Improve flexibility for live intrusion detection and monitoring by
    adding finer-grained record matching support for audit pipes, such
    as by-pid and by-pid-tree.
3.  Introduce multi-host network support for experimental bsmtrace
    intrusion detection package, allowing central monitoring and alarms
    on live bsm traces from many hosts.
4.  Continue analysis of CC audit requirements to flesh out missing
    event sources, such as user admin tools that don't currently
    generate audit records.

The port will only run as a guest (i.e. domU) right now, on i386/PAE
platforms. Status:

-   domU is self-hosting on 8-CURRENT (can compile world + kernel in a
    VM).
-   Xen 3.0.3 and earlier are not supported.
-   Device structure needs to be cleaned up, it's not conformant to
    newbus.
-   SMP and amd64 are targeted for support by May for RELENG_6 and
    RELENG_7.
-   dom0 support is not currently on the roadmap.

Open tasks:

1.  Substantial cleanup needed, talk with Kip Macy or Scott Long if you
    are interested in helping

Contact: Security Team <security-team@FreeBSD.org>

In the time since the last status report, four security advisories have
been issued concerning problems in the base system of FreeBSD; one of
these problems was in "contributed" code maintained outside of FreeBSD.
The FreeBSD Vulnerabilities and Exposures Markup Language (VuXML)
document has continued to be updated; since the last status report, 61
new entries have been added, bringing the total up to 1023. Many of
these new VuXML entries were made by members of the "ports-security"
team.

The "ports-security" team is still looking for more committers who can
periodically help with fixing ports security issues and documenting them
in the FreeBSD VuXML document. Committers who wish to help with this
effort can contact simon@ for details.

The following FreeBSD releases are supported by the FreeBSD Security
Team: FreeBSD 5.5, FreeBSD 6.1, FreeBSD 6.2, and FreeBSD 6.3. The
respective End of Life dates of supported releases are listed on the web
site; it is expected that the upcoming FreeBSD 7.0 release will be
supported for one year after its release.

Kernel

Coda

Contact: Robert Watson <rwatson@FreeBSD.org>

A large number of bugs have been fixed in the FreeBSD "coda" kernel
module over the past six months, and a man page has been added to
describe the module. Many of these bugs were the result of the coda
module failing to keep up with the many enhancements to FreeBSD VFS over
the last few years. As a result of these fixes, it is now possible to
use Coda with FreeBSD 7.x and 8.x without immediate panics, and possibly
for an extended period. The new man page does clarify that Coda is an
experimental distributed file system and not yet appropriate for
production use on FreeBSD, but things are looking a lot better than they
were.

DDB scripting, output capture, and textdumps

  -------
  Links
  -------

Contact: Robert Watson <rwatson@FreeBSD.org>

The kernel DDB facility has been enhanced to add several new features:

DDB scripting allows the user to define a set of simple scripts from
within the debugger or userspace using the new ddb(8) tool to automate
debugging steps. Scripts can be automatically executed when the debugger
is entered ("kdb.enter.panic", "kdb.enter.break", ...) or manually using
the DDB "run" command.

DDB output capture allows the user to request that the output of DDB be
captured into a buffer for access from user space or to be written out
in a textdump.

DDB textdumps, a new dump format that writes out a tarball of text-based
debugging information, such as the kernel message buffer, panic message,
kernel configuration, kernel version, and DDB capture buffer to the swap
partition, to be extracted via savecore(8). This provides a compact,
portable, and kernel compile independent debugging package.

Various interesting formulas for use are described in ddb(4) and
textdump(4); the facilities are separable, so you can, for example, run
a few DDB commands and capture their output, then write a regular dump
and extract that output using kgdb, or you can do the same and write it
out as a textdump. Likewise, scripts can be used to automate manual
debugging, or implement textdumps by enabling output capture, running a
series of commands, and forcing a textdump to be written before
rebooting.

Support for these facilities has been merged into 8-CURRENT, and will be
merged to 7-STABLE after the release of FreeBSD 7.0.

Open tasks:

1.  Improve semantics of combining textdumps with KDB_UNATTENDED.
2.  Allow scripts to use the DDB "continue" command when the script has
    been started automatically as a result of a KDB enter event, such as
    "kdb.enter.sysctl" or "kdb.enter.break".

FreeBSD SMP network stack scalability

  -------

  -------

Contact: Robert Watson <rwatson@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Kris Kennaway <kris@FreeBSD.org>

There are a variety of on-going projects relating to improving SMP
scalability of the FreeBSD network stack post-7.0. These include:

Detailed profiling of application workloads such as BIND9, MySQL, PgSQL
and Apache have been used to identify performance bottlenecks and to
guide changes to the source code.

rwlock(9) use for pcbinfo and inpcb locking , allowing the acquisition
of only read locks for pcbinfo and inpcb during UDP receive and
transmit--this is highly desirable in order to improve BIND9
performance, which sends and receives from many threads at a time on a
single UDP socket.

Breaking out pcbinfo into a series of parallel data structures , where
the particular pcbinfo instance is selected using a hash of the
connection tuple (and where ambiguous cases are present in all
instances). This would allow greatly reducing pcbinfo contention for
parallel input cases, which are increasingly likely with multiple input
queue network devices, such as the Chelsio cxgb 10gbps driver.

Investigation of use opportunities for rmlock(9) -- rmlocks provide very
lightweight acquisition for read, but expensive acquisition for write,
and may be an appropriate replacement for rwlocks where significantly
more reads than writes take place -- such as for firewall rule list
protection, pf hook registration, address lists, etc.

Weak connection affinity , in which the effective affinity of a
connection, determined by its hash/rss work assignment to a particular
input queue by the network stack or network card, is tracked and exposed
to user space so that work associated with that connection can be
performed on or close to the CPU where the kernel will be processing
input for the connection. Software work placement has been done using
the netisr2 implementation, which creates per-CPU netisr threads and
assigns work based on connection properties.

There are also many other pieces of related work going on, especially
relating to 10gbps network drivers, and workloads of particular interest
include BIND9, MySQL, pgsql, Apache, and general TCP parallelism.

FreeBSD/mips

Contact: Ollivier Houchard <cognet@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Randall Stewart <rrs@FreeBSD.org>

FreeBSD/mips boots to multiuser using gxemul on the MALTA board with a
4Kc based CPU. The port is targeting MIPS32 and MIPS64 release 1 and
release 2 based systems. Work is underway to support multicore systems.

Preliminary ports to adm 5120, the IDT RC32434, the Sentry 5, and a few
other targets have started. These ports are in various stages of
stability.

Juniper Networks has donated a generic MIPS FreeBSD port. This port
doesn't run on any real hardware, but contains the necessary parts to
run on idealized MIPS hardware. The FreeBSD/mips workers have been
merging the current base and the Juniper code into a unified base. In
addition, Cavium Networks has donated code supporting their multicore
mips64r2 platform. This code is also being merged into the tree and
cleaned up as well. The merged code base presently is making it to the
first (or maybe second) call to cpu_switch before dying. Active work is
underway in this area.

LVM geom class

Contact: Andrew Thompson <thompsa@FreeBSD.org>

glvm is a geom class which reads the metadata from a LVM2 (Linux volume
manager) disk and creates a geom provider for each logical volume. An
example is the logs lv on a volume group called vg0 appearing as
/dev/lvm/vg0-logs, this can be mounted as a disk.

The code is working and will be posted for testing soon.

  ----------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contact: Andre Oppermann <andre@FreeBSD.org>

The FreeBSD TCP code has evolved a lot over time and many new features
were added. However over time it got crufty, complex and hard to read
and track. In some places functionality was moved away but the
corresponding code in the main TCP functions was not or not fully
removed.

The main purpose of of the TCP code cleanup and rewrite is to make the
code:

-   Easily readable again;
-   Easily trackable again;
-   A lot simpler to maintain;
-   Verifiably correct and RFC conforming;
-   Easily extendable for new congestion control algorithms;
-   Increase in performance.

Quite a bit of code is already (re)written but a lot still remains to be
done.

Open tasks:

1.  Integration of code from private branch into public perforce
    repository.
2.  Completion of code and rewrite. Integration with pluggable
    congestion control algorithms.
3.  Full code behavior check against all TCP RFCs and drafts of upcoming
    RFCs.
4.  Extended testing and full code review by other TCP developers.

Multi-IPv4/v6 jails

  -------
  Links
  -------

Contact: Bjoern A. Zeeb <bz@FreeBSD.ORG>

The multi-IPv4/v6 jails project was resumed in early January after
previous work had been abandoned in 2006.

As an alternate solution to full network stack virtualization, this work
shall provide a lightweight solution for multi-IP virtualization. The
changes are even more important because of the emerging demand for IPv6.

The current status includes updated user space utilities. Kernel side
has grown support for multiple IP addresses for both address families in
jails, while the old kernel internal lookup/checking functions were kept
and can be compiled in during the transition period limiting jails to
one IP address. Additionally a show jails DDB command was added to ease
debugging.

As an auxiliary project the last suser(9) checks were replaced in
netinet6/ to support optional raw IPv6 sockets with jails. The new
priv(9) checks were committed to HEAD.

Open tasks:

1.  Check for proper v4-mapped v6 address handling.
2.  Review/add SCTP jail checks.
3.  Think of enhanced lookups for jails with lots of IP addresses
    (preserving the "primary" IPv4 address).
4.  Regression tests and review.

TCP Reassembly Queue Optimization

  TCP reassembly queue source file   URL: http://perforce.freebsd.org/fileViewer.cgi?FSPC=//depot/projects/tcp_reass/netinet/tcp_reass.c
  ---------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contact: Andre Oppermann <andre@FreeBSD.org>

The FreeBSD TCP reassembly queue system has reached its limits with
today's high speed links over long distances and large socket buffers.
The old code is almost unchanged compared to 4.4BSD and gets quite
inefficient with large mbuf chains.

The new code aggregates consecutive segments into blocks and inserts the
blocks into a tail queue. The insertion points for a newly arrived
segment are checked in order of their probability. This prevents full
chain traversals and is very efficient.

To prevent easy resource exhaustion attacks the effective mbuf usage is
accounted for and limited by the size of socket buffer. This way the
reassembly queue can't be abused with many holes among small segments.

A further addition is the combination of received SACK block tracking
with the reassembly queue. The reassembly queue now tracks all blocks of
segments. This makes tracking it again for SACK unnecessary.
Additionally the limitation to six SACK blocks is lifted and the size of
the inpcb structure is reduced quite a bit.

The new code is stable and in testing correctly handles the download of
a full set of FreeBSD CDROM images and 180 ports distfiles from widely
distributed sites around the world at 2% packet loss.

Open tasks:

1.  Additional small performance and space optimizations.
2.  Extended testing with new ipfw tcptruncate option to chop up TCP
    segments and feed them with full and partial loss into reassembly.
3.  Full code review by other TCP developers.

Since the last status report we have made a nice progress about the
website translation. The structure of the translated sites is polished
and we have brought a significant set of pages up-to-date. New pages
with important content have also been translated. Apart from the good
progress, there is a still a lot to do. Some pages are still seriously
outdated and some important parts are missing.

At the same time, we have added one new article translation and one is
still awaiting review before being committed.

Open tasks:

1.  Continue synchronizing the website with the English one and
    translate further important parts
2.  Synchronize the articles and the Handbook
3.  Add new translations

Userland Programs

malloc(3)

Contact: Jason Evans <jasone@FreeBSD.org>

malloc(3) has been enhanced in several ways to reduce lock contention
when multi-threaded programs concurrently use the malloc(3) functions.
The primary enhancements are lazy deallocation and dynamic arena load
balancing.

Lazy deallocation is designed to reduce contention for programs that use
the producer-consumer model, where a thread produces (allocates)
objects, and a pool of worker threads consumes (deallocates) those
objects. As a side benefit, lazy deallocation also substantially reduces
lock contention if multiple unrelated threads are using the same arena.

Allocation activity patterns can change throughout the lifetime of a
program. Dynamic arena load balancing monitors arena lock contention and
re-assigns threads to other arenas as necessary, thus smoothing out
allocator performance.

In order to monitor lock contention in support of arena load balancing,
I had to switch to using pthreads mutexes. This all by itself smoothed
out allocator performance under high load, since the internal libc
"spinlocks" aren't really spinlocks, whereas malloc now spins for a bit
before blocking.

I plan to MFC these changes to RELENG_7, hopefully in time for the
FreeBSD 7.1 release.

procstat(1)

Contact: Robert Watson <rwatson@FreeBSD.org>

A new command line tool, procstat(1), allows detailed inspection and
printing of process properties, including file descriptors, threads,
kernel thread stacks, credentials, and virtual memory mappings of
processes. Several new sysctls have been added to the kernel in order to
export this information cleanly, and the stack(9) facility has been
enhanced to allow the capture of kernel stacks from threads other than
curthread. None of these features depends on procfs, continuing the
effort to remove a requirement for procfs in order to print process
information, as well as adding new types of information not available
with procfs. Kernel stack printing is particularly useful as it provides
much more detailed information on why a thread is blocked in kernel
beyond the useful but limited wmesg context provided to date. This is
helpful in debugging both user process problems and kernel problems.
procstat has been merged into FreeBSD 8-CURRENT, and will be merged to
7-STABLE after FreeBSD 7.0 is released.

Open tasks:

1.  Merge to RELENG_7.
2.  Add a mode to print process signal disposition.

Completed initial requirements gathering. Selection of development tools
complete. General internal design complete.

Ports 2.0 goals are:

-   Re-engineer/modernize the ports build process using graph theory and
    more flexible depends calculations.
-   Better document ports 1.0 and 2.0
-   Maintain 100% user level compatibility with ports 1.0
-   After a long trial period replace ports 1.0 in the "base system"

Open tasks:

1.  Create engine
2.  Combine ports 1.0 docs from porters guide and the handbook into a
    single guide
3.  Create a proof of concept by building xorg (including all
    dependanicies) under the new system
4.  Create mailing list and web site

The ports count continues to accelerate and is now over 18,000. The PR
count, which had dipped to around 750 before the 6.3/7.0 freeze, is now
back up to about 1000, due to the fact that we remain in ports slush.

Because of the freeze/slush, no experimental ports runs have been
committed since the last report. Although 2 more -exp runs have been
completed, we are waiting for 7.0R to commit them.

Once 7.0R happens, a lot of chaos is going to happen in the Ports
Collection. This has built up during the long release cycle. Get ready
for the following changes, among others:

-   upgrade of KDE to 4.0 (being tested)
-   upgrade to gettext
-   upgrade to libtool
-   introduction of perl 5.10
-   final removal of XFree86 (deprecated for quite some time)
-   removal of other expired ports

Most of the portmgr activity was related to the QA process for the
releases. In addition, linimon spent quite some time trying to get the
sparc64 ports into better shape, and sent out a request for more people
to help test sparc64 ports. Some people have responded with offers for
letting committers get accounts on their machines.

Unfortunately during this time period, we became unable to build
packages for ia64-7. As a result, we are not currently building packages
for ia64 any more. If any one wants to step up to work on this
architecture, let portmgr know.

We are currently building packages for amd64-5, amd64-6, amd64-7,
amd64-8, i386-5, i386-6, i386-7, i386-8, sparc64-6, and sparc64-7. Note,
however, that RELENG_5 will reach the end of its supported life on May
31, and package builds for those 2 buildenvs will stop as of that date.
(8 buildenvs * 18,000 ports should be enough to keep us busy.)

Other than that, the packages are in the best shape that they have been
in for some time. linimon continues to work on package analysis tools
for portsmon.

We have added 2 new committers since the last report.

Open tasks:

1.  Most of the remaining ports PRs are "existing port/PR assigned to
    committer". Although the maintainer-timeout policy is helping to
    keep the backlog down, we are going to need to do more to get the
    ports in the shape they really need to be in.
2.  Although we have added many maintainers, we still have over 4,000
    unmaintained ports (see, for instance, the list on portsmon). We are
    always looking for dedicated volunteers to adopt at least a few
    unmaintained ports. As well, the packages on amd64 and sparc64 lag
    behind i386, and we need more testers for those.

Bug Busting

Contact: Mark Linimon <bugmeister_at_FreeBSD_dot_org>

As a result of a posting on freebsd-current@ complaining about a
communication gap between users and developers, there has been a great
deal of new interest in working on bugbusting -- in particular, we
brainstormed on ideas on how non-committers can help. The two main ideas
that are being discussed are incoming bug triage (classifying, rating,
and so forth), and working with users (helping users to work through
problems that aren't classical Problem Reports.

As a result of this, we held our first Bugathon in quite some time (on
#freebsd-bugbusters on EFNet). Over 30 people participated. As a result
of this, over 120 PRs were closed, and dozens more were put into the
'feedback' state. Most of these PRs were in the kern/ and bin/
categories, which are the two that need the most work. (The new arrival
rate was over 40/day during this time, including ports, so there was a
significant net decrease.)

Several new wiki pages were created to support this effort, and finally
capture a lot of the previous discussions from both the mailing list and
the IRC channel. There are even more good ideas which Mark Linimon has
promised to work up and investigate, including:

-   a web page to show "last N days of PRs"
-   some way for committers to only view PRs that have been in some way
    'vetted' or 'confirmed'
-   more publicity for what we've already got in place, and for what we
    intend to do next
-   new categories, classifications, and states for PRs, that will
    better match our workflow

Note: at this time we are not yet looking to replace GNATS. The idea
right now is to see what we can learn about how our workflow does (and
ought to) work, and experiment with some low-cost changes to get various
people's reactions. Linimon's feeling is that any of these kinds of
changes would carry over to a new system, if we were to change over.

rwatson also created a wiki page to put down some thoughts about how to
work on the various kernel problems that are reported. Although
preliminary, this captures some expertise and puts it into a place where
prospective volunteers can more easily find it.

The overall PR count is back up to just under 5300. Although this is net
increase from the previous report, there were long periods of src and
ports freeze during this time, which creates a spike in the overall
count. (src and ports both remain in slush during that time). The peak
number was approaching 5500.

Overall, we seem to have some momentum and new volunteers interested in
working on user-reported problems. bugmeister is hopeful that we can
capitalize on this and make some good progress in the rest of 2008.

FreeBSD Mirror Site Status

Contact: Edwin Groothuis <edwin@FreeBSD.org>

There are several websites already with overview of the FreeBSD FTP
mirrror sites, but they all seem to have one problem: They are not
manually updated with the list of sites. For example,
http://mirrorlist.freebsd.org/FBSDsites.php, despite being hosted by an
Australia, doesn't have the Australian mirrors on it, while
http://people.freebsd.org/~kuriyama/mirrors/ doesn't tell you which
files are available from there. The data on my page shows the
availability of the ISO images on all FTP mirror sites. The list of FTP
mirror sites is obtained from DNS by either doing a zone-transfer or by
just trying the standard names. The first data block shows a quick
overview of the availability of the ISO image directories per server,
architecture and mirror site. The second data block shows a verbose
availability of the contents of the ISO image directories per server.

Open tasks:

1.  The next addition will be the availability of the pre-build
    packages.

Like every year for the past few years is held what in France is mostly
called "Solutions Linux" in Paris La Défense. The exhibition will take
place the 29, 30 and 31st of January in the CNIT.

The interesting thing about this event is that 80% of the floor is taken
by companies (IBM, Novell, Oracle), and the remaining 20% is given
freely to associations and non-profit organizations, where you'll find
many (if not most) french LUGs, *BSDs, most Linux distributions,
Mozilla, OOo...

This year, FreeBSD will once again have a booth, and we'll be showing
what FreeBSD is, why it's the damn best OS out there. We'll also be
distributing flyers and CD's for the whole three days

Admission to the exhibitions is free, so if you ever happen to pass by,
come and see us, we'll be at booth A39.
