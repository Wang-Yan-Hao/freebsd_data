Introduction

Throughout July and August, the FreeBSD Project has been working on
pulling together the last few major pieces of new functionality for
FreeBSD 5.0-RELEASE. At this point, the release appears to be on track
for late November or early December. Work on fine-grained locking
continues, especially in the VFS, as with improved support for threading
through the KSE work; features such as GEOM, UFS2, and TrustedBSD MAC
are maturing, and the new ia64 and sparc64 hardware ports are
approaching production quality. In the next two months, we have a lot to
look forward to: additional 5.0 developer preview snapshots, additional
locking and threading improvements, and many cleanups on the new
supported architectures. Firewire support has been imported into the
main tree, and substantial cleanup of the ACPI/legacy PCI code is also
in the works. Also, expect the import of new IPsec hardware acceleration
support in the near future.

When new developer previews are posted, please give them a try! While we
know that 5.0-RELEASE will be for "early adopters", the more testing we
get out of the way now, the less we have to tidy up later. The new
features are extremely exciting, and understanding when and how to
deploy them properly will be important. In the next two months, among
other things, the release engineering team will post updated release
schedules, as well as guidance for FreeBSD consumers as to how to decide
what releases of FreeBSD will be right for them. Keep an eye out for
this, and provide us with feedback.

Also, for those of you in Europe -- we look forward to seeing you at
BSDCon Europe in a couple of months!

I'm very pleased to announce that another engineering release is
available for download at
http://www.geocities.com/m_evmenkin/ngbt-fbsd-20020909.tar.gz

This release features several major changes and includes support for H4
UART and H2 USB transport layers, Host Controller Interface (HCI), Link
Layer Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP) and Bluetooth sockets
layer. It also comes with several user space utilities that can be used
to configure and test Bluetooth devices. Also there are several man
pages.

Service Discovery Protocol (SDP) is now supported. This release includes
SDP daemon, configuration tool and user space library (ported from
BlueZ-sdp-0.7).

RFCOMM is now supported. This release includes rfcommd daemon that
provides RFCOMM service via pseudo ttys. Not very useful for legacy
application, but it is possible to run PPP over Bluetooth now. This was
ported from old BlueZ-rfcommd-1.1 (no longer supported by BlueZ) and
still has some bugs in it.

Next step is to fix current RFCOMM support and work on new in-kernel
RFCOMM and BNEP (Bluetooth Network Encapsulation Protocol)
implementation. Also user space need more work (better tools, libraries,
documentation etc.).

ATAPI/CAM Status Report

  ------- ----------------------------------------------------

Contact: Thomas Quinot <thomas@FreeBSD.org>

The ATAPI/CAM module allows ATAPI devices (CD-ROM, CD-RW, DVD drives,
floppy drives such as Iomega Zip, tape drives) to be accessed through
the SCSI subsystem (CAM). ATAPI/CAM has been integrated in -CURRENT. The
code should be fairly functional (it has been used by many testers as
patches against -STABLE and -CURRENT over the past eight months), but
there are pending issues on SMP machines. Testers most welcome.

A MFC of this feature will probably happen after the end of the 4.7 code
freeze.

Fast IPsec Status

Contact: Sam Leffler <sam@FreeBSD.org>

The main goal of this project is to modify the IPsec protocols to use
the kernel-level crypto subsystem imported from OpenBSD (see elsewhere).
A secondary goal is to do general performance tuning of the IPsec
protocols.

Recent work focused on increasing performance. Support is still limited
to IPv4 protocols, with IPv6 support coded but not yet tested.

Import of this work into the -current tree has started. A publicly
available patch against 4.7 will be released once 4.7 ships.

On the API front, fmtmsg(3) was implemented, glob(3) was given support
for new flags, ulimit(3) was implemented, and wide character/string
support was significantly improved with the addition of 30 new functions
(see the project status board for details). Work is progressing on
adding the C99 restrict type-qualifier to functions throughout the
system. This allows the compiler to make additional optimizations based
on the knowledge that a restrict-qualified argument is the only
reference to a given object (ie. it doesn't overlap with another
argument).

Several headers have been brought up to conformance with POSIX.1-2001,
they include: <fmtmsg.h>, <poll.h>, <sys/mman.h>, and <ulimit.h>. The
header <cpio.h> was implemented. The headers <machine/ansi.h> and
<machine/types.h> were merged into a single header to help simplify the
way variable types are created.

The sh(1) built-in, command(1), was reimplemented to conform with POSIX.
Additionally, several utilities which were previously brought up to
conformance were merged into the 4-STABLE branch.

committers as quickly as possible. We now have a "Committer Want List"
available in our section of the Web site. Several small items, such as
network cards, have been routed to people who are willing to write the
code to support them. We have a few larger donations (i.e., actual
servers) ready to go to developers, once shipping information is
straightened out.

The GNOME 2 desktop port has reach version 2.0.2rc1 with an expected
2.0.2 release before 4.7-RELEASE. Mozilla 1.1 has been ported, and is
resident in the tree with Mozilla 1.0.1. The GNOMENG porting effort is
going well. A good deal of ports have been moved to the new
infrastructure with the help of Edwin Groothuis. We are now working on
smoothing out some of the rough edges, then, once all the work is done,
make GNOMENG the default.

A long-standing annoyance in Nautilus has also been recently corrected.
The desktop is no longer cluttered with volume icons, and removable
media (such as CDs) should now be handled correctly.

Contact: Jacques Vidrine <nectar@FreeBSD.org>

The Security Team continues to be very busy. The security-officer
mailing list traffic for the months of June, July, and August consisted
of 1,230 messages (over 13 messages a day). This is well over 50% of the
freebsd-hackers traffic volume in the same period!

Since June (the time of our last report), 9 new Security Advisories were
published, and one Security Notice was published covering 25 Ports
Collection issues.

FreeBSD 4.6.2-RELEASE was released on August 15th. This marked the first
time a point release was created from the security branch. The process
went smoothly from the Security Team perspective, despite a schedule
slippage due to newly discovered bugs, and a snafu which resulted in
4.6.1-RELEASE being skipped.

In September, the FreeBSD Security Officer published a new PGP key (ID
0xCA6CDFB2, found on the FTP site and in the Handbook). This aligned the
set of those who possess the corresponding private key with the
membership of the security-officer alias published on the FreeBSD
Security web site. It also worked around an issue with the deprecated
PGP key being found corrupted on some public key servers.

default in 5.0-RELEASE.

Currently work on a cryptographic module which should be able to protect
a diskpartition from practically any sort of attack is progressing.

Hardware Crypto Support Status

Contact: Sam Leffler <sam@FreeBSD.org>

The goal of this project is to import the OpenBSD kernel-level crypto
subsystem. This facility provides kernel- and user-level access to
hardware crypto devices for the calculation of cryptographic hashes,
ciphers, and public key operations. The main clients of this facility
are the kernel RNG (/dev/random), network protocols (e.g. IPSEC), and
OpenSSL (through the /dev/crypto device).

OpenSSL 0.9.7 beta 3 was imported and patched with fixes from OpenBSD's
source tree. This permits any user-level application that use -lcrypto
to automatically get hardware crypto acceleration. Otherwise the core
crypto support is stable and has been in production use on -stable
machines for several months.

Import of this work into the -current tree has started. A publicly
available patch against 4.7 will be released once 4.7 ships. Integration
of this work into the -stable source tree is planned for 4.8.

latest 5-current/4-stable without any errors. Also current problem, less
CPU power for the future, is not solved yet -- but situation is not so
bad, I hope I'll show a good news in the next report.

We have been updating RELENG_4 targeting for 4.7-RELEASE. When port
ja-man-1.1j_5 was broken around the end of July, Kumano-san and Mori-san
tried to update the port to be based on a newer FreeBSD base system's
man commands. But, we decided only to fix the port ja-man-1.1j_5 to be
buildable, as the new one was not complete at that time.

accompany it. I have just committed a rework of the run states for
kernel threads that simplifies or solves some problems that were being
seen recently.

Hopefully in the next few weeks we will be able to run threads on
separate processors. The basics of Signal support are presently
evolving. Archie Cobbs will also be assisting with some of this work. I
have a mail alias for all the developers at kse@elischer.org. It is

Libh Status Report

Contact: Antoine Beaupré <anarcat@anarcat.ath.cx>
Contact: Alexander Langer <alex@FreeBSD.org>

The primary libh development box, where the CVS repo and development
webpage was living, is dead. The server has crashed after a system
upgrade and has never came back to life. We had to pull the drives out
of it to make proper backups. We will setup another box in place of this
one and hope for the best. So right now, the port is broken because the
CVS is unaccessible, as the development web page. We're working on it,
please bear with us.

On a brighter note, Max started implementing the changes he proposed to
the build system and the TCL API; LibH is switching to SWIG for its TCL
bindings, which should simplify the system a lot, and shorten build
times. The Hui subsystem is therefore being completely re-written. On my
side, I made a few tests in building and running LibH under rhtvision,
and it didn't fulfill the promises I thought it would, so I just put
aside that idea. Work on libh stalled during July because I completely
lost network access for the whole month. So right now, LibH is in a bit
of a mess, but we have high hopes of settling everything down to a new
release pretty soon, which will make full use of the new SWIG bindings.

Lottery Scheduler for FreeBSD -STABLE

Contact: Mário Sérgio Fujikawa Ferreira <lioux@FreeBSD.org>

Yet another implementation of Lottery Scheduling devised by Carl
Waldspurger et. al. is being developed against FreeBSD -STABLE branch.
It is being developed as part of a graduation project in Computer
Science at Universidade de Brasília in Brazil. Therefore, other
implementations have not yet been verified to avoid plagiarization but
will be checked in a later stage of this project searching for better
implementation ideas. Currently, part of the necessary scheduling kernel
structure has been mapped and work has progressed despite the general
lack of kernel documentation. Further outcomes of this project will be a
simple documentation of the kernel scheduler structure of -STABLE
branch, a port of the Lottery Scheduler to -CURRENT branch and
additional implementations of other scheduling disciplines from Carl
Waldspurger et. al. Members of the FreeBSD community have been and will
continue to be instrumental in both testing and providing feedback for
ideas implemented here.

Version 1.2 has been released recently. It should compile and work an
any recent FreeBSD-current. Support to manipulate SUNI registers has
been added to the ATM drivers (to switch between SONET and SDH modes,
for example). The ngatmsig package now includes a small and simple call
control module that may be used to build a simple ATM switch. The
netgraph stuff has been patched to use the official netgraph locking.

Network interface cloning and modularity

Contact: Brooks Davis <brooks@FreeBSD.org>

Cloning support for ppp(4) and disc(4) interfaces has been committed. A
man page for disc has been created and the disc devices now appear as
disc# instead of ds#. Some work is still needed on pppd to make it
understand cloning though it should work as long as the devices are
created beforehand.

On the API front, management of mandatory interfaces (i.e. lo0) is
handled by the generic cloning code so if_clone_destroy has the same API
as NetBSD again and <if>_modevent doesn't need to create the necessary
devices manually.

At this point, all pseudo interfaces have been converted to the cloning
API or already did their own cloning (sl(4) for example uses it's own
mechanism). Some devices such as tun(4) and tap/vmware should probably
be converted to use the cloning API instead of their current ad-hoc,
devfs based cloning system. This would be a good junior kernel hacker
task. Also, the handbook and FAQ could use some general cloning
documentation prior to 5.0 release.

New SCSI Target Emulator

  ------- -----------------------------------------

Contact: Nate Lawson <nate@root.org>

The existing SCSI target code has been rewritten. The kernel driver is
much simpler, deferring all functionality to usermode and simply passing
CCBs to and from the SIM. The supplied usermode emulates a disk (RBC)
with IO going to a backing file. It replaces /sys/cam/scsi/scsi_target*
and /usr/share/examples/scsi_target.

The code is definitely alpha quality and has known problems on -current
although it appears to work ok on -stable. See the included README for
how to install and test. Feedback is welcome!

Contact: Scott Long <scottl@FreeBSD.org>

Work on RAIDFrame stalled for quite a bit, then it picked up in early
summer, then it stalled, and now it's going again. A significant amount
of work has been done to make the locking SMPng-friendly and to cut down
on kernel stack abuse. I'm happy to say that it's starting to work
reliably when used with file- backed 'md' disks. Even more exciting is
that it's finally starting to work on real disks, too. A lot of cleanup
is still needed, and a few gross hacks still exist, but it might
actually be ready for the FreeBSD 5.0 release. Patches for FreeBSD
5-current and 4-stable are available from the website. The 4-stable
patches are a year old but still apply and perform well.

The Release Engineering (RE) Team completed and released FreeBSD 4.6.2.
This ``point release'' fixes several important bugs in the ATA
subsystem, as well as addressing a number of security issues in the base
system that surfaced shortly after FreeBSD 4.6 was released. The release
documentation distributed with FreeBSD 4.6.2 contains more details.
(Note: Some earlier documents and reports referred to this release as
version 4.6.1.) The next release in the 4.X series will be FreeBSD 4.7,
which has a scheduled release date of 1 October 2002.

Concurrently, work is continuing on the 5.0-DP2 developer preview
snapshot, an important milestone along the release path of FreeBSD 5.0,
which is scheduled for release on 20 November. As 5.0 draws closer, we
are focusing more on getting the system stabilized, as opposed to adding
new functionality. To help us with this effort, developers should
discuss with us any new features planned for -CURRENT, beginning 1
October.

progressing fast: the Handbook has been half translated and articles are
under way. The previous Brazilian Project is proud to become part of
such a dedicate group. The contacts above represent the current official
contacts for the new translation group. We hope to have at least part of
this work ready for the FreeBSD 4.7 Release.

TrustedBSD Mandatory Access Control (MAC)

Contact: Robert Watson <rwatson@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: TrustedBSD Discussion Mailing List
<trustedbsd-discuss@TrustedBSD.org>

It's been a busy few months, with a variety of development,
documentation, and public relations activities. The MAC Framework, our
pluggable kernel access control mechanism for FreeBSD, has matured
substantially, and large parts of it were merged to the main FreeBSD
tree over July and August.

A variety of entry point changes were made, including: component names
are now passed to VFS namespace VOPs; aggressive caching of MAC labels
in vnodes; mmap memory access downgrades on subject relabel; check for
access()/eaccess(); checks for vnode read, write, ioctl, pool,
permitting revocation post-open() by aware policies; labeling and access
control checks for pipe IPC objects, clean up of socket/visibility
checks; checks for socket bind, connect, listen, ....; many locking
improvements and assertions, especially for vnodes, processes; framework
now supports partial label updates on subjects and objects; credential
management in 'struct file' improved so that active_cred and file_cred
are more carefully distinguished and passed to MAC framework explicitly;
accounting system uses cached credentials for write operations now;
socreate() can use cached credential to label sockets fixing deferred
nfs socket connections and reconnections with TCP; kse interactions with
proc1 fixed; IO_NOMACCHECK flag to vn_rdwr() for internal use to avoid
redundant or incorrect MAC checks on aio vnode operations; mac_syscall()
policy function demux; su no longer changes MAC labels by default;
mac_get_pid() to support ps and getpmac -p pid; mmap revocation defaults
to "fail stop"; MAC_DEBUG wraps atomic label counters; UFS2 extended
attributes supported; initial port of LOMAC to the MAC framework; update
all policies for all these changes; merge of KSE III; merge of nmount();
upgrade of ugidfw to speak user and group names; libugidfw; many
namespace and naming consistency improvements; module dependencies on
MAC framework; large scale merging of MAC functionality to the main
FreeBSD tree. KDE interfaces to common management activities.

Wrote and taught full-day MAC framework tutorial at STOS BSD and Darwin
Security Symposium; first draft of MAC framework architecture and API
guide. This is now in the Developer's Handbook.

Next couple of months will bring continued maturity improvements,
labeling and protection of more objects; VFS performance improvements;
better support for UFS2 EAs and separate EA entries for each policy;
improved support for LOMAC; MLS compartments; IPsec security association
labeling; improved SEBSD FLASK/TE port; and much more.

Contact: Poul-Henning Kamp <phk@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Kirk McKusick <mckusick@FreeBSD.org>

The UFS2 filesystem approaches feature completion: Extended attribute
functionality have been added, including a new compound modification API
and basic testing has been passed.

  VM corruption patch for -stable.   URL: http://apollo.backplane.com/FreeBSD/wiring_patch_03.diff
  ---------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------

Contact: Matthew Dillon <dillon@FreeBSD.org>

Work is in progress to MFC a number of bug fixes related to vm_map
corruption into -stable. This work is probably too involved to make it
into the 4.7 release but is expected to be committed just after the
freeze is lifted. The corruption in question typically occurs in
large-memory systems under heavy loads and typically panics or KPFs
(kernel-page-fault's) the machine in a vm_map related function.
