Pantheon desktop on FreeBSD

https://codeberg.org/olivierd/freebsd-ports-elementary

Contact: Olivier Duchateau <duchateau.olivier@gmail.com>

The Pantheon desktop environment is designed for elementary OS. It
builds on GNOME technologies (such as Mutter, GNOME Shell, GTK 3 and 4)
and it is written in Vala.

The goal is to have a new desktop for users. Some features are not well
supported, but we can have full session.

The repository contains Mk/Uses framework elementary.mk, official
applications, and curated ports which depend of x11-toolkits/granite
(total of 56 new ports).

I have submitted several patches, especially:

-   x11-toolkits/granite7

-   devel/libgee update to 0.20.5 bug #262893

-   sysutils/bamf update to 0.5.6 bug #264203

Open tasks

-   Add support of user settings (it is very Ubuntu-centric)

-   Finish porting wingpanel-indicator-power (power management)
