NXP DPAA2 support

Some of the NXP SoCs (LX2160A, LS1088A) are shipped with DPAA2, the
second generation of the data path acceleration architecture. It allows
to dynamically configure and wire packet processing "objects" (DPNI for
a network interface, DPMAC for media access controller, etc.) together
to form a network-on-a-chip.

During the last quarter the driver started working well enough to be
used on SolidRun' Honeycomb LX2 (ACPI test platform) and Traverse
Technologies has produced a FreeBSD preview for (their) Ten64 (used as
FDT test platform).

The driver is still work-in-progress, but is getting close for a review
to get the first version into the tree for everyone to benefit from it.

WIP:

-   FDT MDIO support. FreeBSD currently lacks support for the SPF parts.

-   Driver resources de-allocation to unload dpaa2.ko properly.

-   Bug fixes and improvements.

TODO:

-   CPU affinity for DPIOs and DPNIs.

-   Cached memory-backed software portals.

-   Bottlenecks mitigation.

-   Further parts (DPSW, DCE, etc.) supported by the hardware.

Sponsor: Bare Enthusiasm :)
Sponsor: Traverse Technologies (providing Ten64 HW for testing)
