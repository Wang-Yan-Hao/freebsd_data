ENA (Elastic Network Adapter) is the smart NIC available in the
virtualized environment of Amazon Web Services (AWS). The ENA driver
supports multiple transmit and receive queues and can handle up to 100
Gb/s of network traffic, depending on the instance type on which it is
used.

Completed since the last update:

-   Upstream of the ENA driver v2.5.0, which included:

-   Improvement to the reset routine handling,

-   Extension of the timer service lifetime in order to be able to
    detect more hardware failures,

-   Fix logic for verifying the Tx request ID,

-   Fix IPv6 L4 checksum offload handling for the Tx,

-   Add NUMA awareness to the driver.

-   Internal review of the upcoming ENA driver release (v2.6.0),
    including:

-   Further reset handling improvements,

-   Code cleanup and style fixes,

-   Logging improvements,

-   Fix to the retrieval of the ENI metrics.

Work in progress:

-   Testing of the upcoming ENA driver release (v2.6.0).
