makefs(8) is a utility, originating in NetBSD, that creates file system
images entirely in userspace. It is a useful component of a toolchain to
build virtual machine (VM) images since it does not require any special
privileges, unlike the approach of formatting a character device,
mounting the fresh file system, and copying files onto it. Moreover,
makefs can create reproducible images and aims to minimize resource
consumption. Currently, FreeBSD’s makefs can build UFS, cd9660, and
msdos (FAT) file system images.

Recent work enables the creation of ZFS images by makefs. This makes it
easier to build ZFS-based VM images. makefs' ZFS support includes the
ability to create multiple datasets, with each mapped to a directory in
the input file hierarchy. Many ZFS features are not supported however,
as the implementation provides only what is needed to get reproducible
root pools.

Follow-up work enables the creation of ZFS-based VM and cloud images by
the release(7) framework, using this new makefs extension.
