Contact: Ed Maste <emaste@freebsd.org>

OpenSSH, a suite of remote login and file transfer tools, was updated
from version 8.8p1 to 9.0p1 in the FreeBSD base system.

It has not yet been merged to the stable/13 and stable/12 branches. I
anticipate doing so in July.

NOTE: OpenSSH 9.0p1 switches scp(1) from using the legacy scp/rcp
protocol to using the SFTP protocol by default. The -O flag is available
to use the previous protocol instead.
