OpenVPN DCO

Contact: Kristof Provost <kp@FreeBSD.org>

OpenVPN DCO (or Data Channel Offload) moves OpenVPN data packet
processing into the kernel.

Traditionally OpenVPN uses a tun(4) interface to transmit and receive
packets. In this setup received packets are received by the kernel,
passed to the OpenVPN application for decryption, then passed back into
the kernel for network stack processing. This requires several
transitions between kernel- and userspace, and naturally imposes a
performance cost.

The new if_ovpn OpenVPN DCO offload driver performs the
encryption/decryption entirely within the kernel, improving performance.

Initial performance testing shows throughput improved from around
660Mbit/s to around 2Gbit/s.

The userspace OpenVPN code also requires modification to use the new
if_ovpn offload driver. This is expected to be part of a future 2.6.0
OpenVPN release.
