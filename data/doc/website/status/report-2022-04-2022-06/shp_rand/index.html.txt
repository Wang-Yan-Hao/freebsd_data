Shared page address randomization

The shared page is an R/X page that is mapped into each process by the
image activator. It stores the signal trampoline, as well as other
metadata e.g. information needed to implement user space timecounters.
Previously it was mapped at the top of the process virtual address
space. With the described changes its address will be randomized. We
plan to turn the feature on by default for 64bit binaries, across all
architectures. Currently the patches are under review and await
approval.
