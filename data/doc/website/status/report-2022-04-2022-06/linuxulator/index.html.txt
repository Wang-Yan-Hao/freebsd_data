Linux compatibility layer update

Contact: Dmitry Chagin <dchagin@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Edward Tomasz Napierala <trasz@FreeBSD.org>

The goal of this project is to improve FreeBSD’s ability to execute
unmodified Linux binaries. Current support status of specific Linux
applications is being tracked at the Linux app status Wiki page.

Implementation of the Y2k38 Linux project is mostly finished; all
'*_time64()' system calls are committed.

The state of the arm64 Linux emulation layer was brought to the state of
the amd64 Linux emulation layer: i.e., implemented the vDSO, machine
dependent futexes, signals delivery.

The thread affinity system calls were modified to implement Linux
semantics.

In total, over 50 bugs were fixed; glibc-2.35 tests suite reports less
than 80 failed tests.

All changes in the Linux emulation layer are merged to the stable/13
branch.

Initial support for fancy Linux system call tracing has been added to
libsysdecode and kdump. There is ongoing work to make tracing more
syscalls work.

Sponsor: EPSRC (Edward’s work)
