OpenBSM is a crucial part of FreeBSD, which provides auditing features
for the operating system. OpenBSM is incorporated into FreeBSD and
macOS. Both Apple and FreeBSD have currently made changes to the OpenBSM
framework, which weren’t upstreamed. This small project aims to
consolidate these changes and upstream them to the OpenBSM github
repository, so that both development efforts can be merged to FreeBSD
later on.

There is currently a pull request pending that synchronizes the FreeBSD
sources with OpenBSM. A comparison was made to incorporate Apple’s
Catalina changes. A few weeks ago Apple has also made the source code of
Big Sur available. In the latest comparison against OpenBSM Apple has
made overlapping ID changes, which are making a simple import of the
changes impossible. I am currently trying to work around that issue by
making OpenBSM a little vendor specific.
