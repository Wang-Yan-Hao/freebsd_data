The FreeBSD project and community continues to grow, and in the last 2
quarters, we established an official FreeBSD server on the popular
Discord platform, as a complementary means for out-reach, support,
collaboration and social connection for and between members of the
FreeBSD community, new and old.

Discord boasts broad accessibility and unique features that the the
community can enjoy without the steeper learning curves associated with
other support and social mediums, that can often deter or overwhelm
newcomers. It also provides an opportunity to broaden FreeBSD’s reach
outside traditional spaces and audiences.

We currently have a respectable 480 members, with that number growing
daily, and have established baseline community guidelines and moderation
processes consistent with and complementary to other support channels
and the FreeBSD Code of Conduct.

While it’s early days, events have already been successfully hosted on
the platform. In January, Tom Jones (thj@) announced and ran an online
Bugathon focusing on issues related to the branching of FreeBSD 13.
We’ve also created dedicated text and voice channels to facilitate more
of these kinds of events in the future. We hope to see more events like
these run as examples of how we can utilize Discord constructively and
in ways we haven’t as a community or project before.

With the future in mind, we have plans to:

-   Automatically announce news, updates and advisories in Discord.

-   Verify and enable additional Discord features designed for large
    communities.

-   Set up bots with unique features, including moderation and
    interactive features for members. We welcome ideas in this regard.

We are keen on project and community members to reach out to talk about
how we can best leverage Discord. Some ideas we’d love people to get
involved with include:

-   Brainstorm/Suggest unique and creative ideas or features.

-   Provide bug reports and user experience feedback and suggestions.

-   Actively promote Discord in other social media spaces, particularly
    those that maybe new or curious to learn more about FreeBSD.

-   Contribute to the Wiki page and its content.

-   Participate and support other members on Discord.

-   Run a live stream on a FreeBSD-related topic.

-   Hang out in our live audio and video channels if you’re comfortable
    doing so.
