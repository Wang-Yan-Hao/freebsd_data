VirtualBox OSE port on FreshPorts URL:

Contact: VirtualBox port team <vbox@FreeBSD.org>

The VirtualBox ports have been updated to the upstream 6.1.18 release.

This is a new major release with new features and better support,
especially for graphics output. This new release has support only for
recent amd64 CPUs providing virtualization support in hardware (VT-x,
AMD-V bits).

The previous versions of the VirtualBox ports have been preserved as the
-legacy versions to allow people unable to use the new version to have a
virtualization solution.

The new additions port at present fails to build on i386 but the old
additions do provide basic functionality for that emulation.
