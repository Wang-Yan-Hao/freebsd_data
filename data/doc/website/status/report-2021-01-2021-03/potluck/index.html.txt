Pot is a jail management tool that also supports orchestration through
Nomad.

Potluck aims to be to FreeBSD and Pot what Dockerhub is to Linux and
Docker: A repository of Pot flavours and complete images for usage with
Pot and in many cases Nomad.

The new Potman project aims to simplify building Pot images with Vagrant
and VirtualBox based on the Potluck approach, e.g. as part of a DevOps
workflow for software development and testing. That way, Pot images can
more easily be created as part of a Jenkins workflow to be deployed with
Nomad and Consul.

In the last two quarters, FreeBSD 12.2 Potluck images have been built
and the 11.4 images have been upgraded with the new packages.
Furthermore, new images like Wordpress and an improved flavour script
(which squashes a nasty network problem) have been created.

Future plans include further Potman workflow features, new and improved
Potluck images and publishing FreeBSD 13-based images.

As always, feedback and patches are welcome.
