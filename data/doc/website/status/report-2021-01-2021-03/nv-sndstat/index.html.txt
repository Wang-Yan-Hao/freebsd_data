nv(9)-based audio device enumeration

This work presents a number of ioctl commands on /dev/sndstat using
nv(9) to expose all available audio device nodes. nv(9) is used to
generate a serialized binary stream representation of the information of
audio device nodes presented in the running system. The documented
nvlist structure in sndstat(4) manual page is stable for programming
use.

For a long time, enumerating the audio device node interface required
parsing content of /dev/sndstat. It is tedious to write such a parser
and handle different hw.snd.verbose levels correctly. Using nv(9)
eliminates the need to write a text parser to do audio device nodes
enumeration.

This work has been committed and is available in FreeBSD 14-CURRENT.
