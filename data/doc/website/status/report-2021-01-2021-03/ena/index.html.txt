ENA (Elastic Network Adapter) is the smart NIC available in the
virtualized environment of Amazon Web Services (AWS). The ENA driver
supports multiple transmit and receive queues and can handle up to 100
Gb/s of network traffic, depending on the instance type on which it is
used.

Completed since the last update:

-   Update ENA driver to v2.3.1

-   Determine location of the MSIx vector table on the device and
    allocate it dynamically - this enables driver usage on instances
    like c5gn.

-   MFC of the ENA v2.3.1 driver to the FreeBSD 11/12/13-STABLE branches

-   ENA v2.3.1 will be a part of the FreeBSD 13.0-RELEASE

Work in progress:

-   Internal review ongoing:

-   Introduce full kernel RSS API support

-   Allow reconfiguration of the RSS indirection table and hash key

-   Adjust iflib framework for the ENA requirements

-   Add DMA width configuration field commit 6dd69f0064f1

-   Add support for admin completion queues commit 09c3f04ff3be

-   Prototype the driver port to the iflib framework
