FreeBSD Translations on Weblate

Links:
Translate FreeBSD on Weblate wiki URL:
https://wiki.freebsd.org/DocTranslationOnWeblate
FreeBSD Weblate Instance URL: https://translate-dev.freebsd.org/

Contact: Danilo G. Baio <dbaio@FreeBSD.org>

After the doc migration to Hugo/AsciiDoctor the Weblate tool it’s opened
again.

There are three projects on our Weblate:

-   Documentation (Books and Articles) - open

-   FreeBSD Doc (Archived) - former project

-   Website - pending

Language teams that were using Weblate before the migration to
Hugo/AsciiDoctor, please see our Translation based on Automatic
Suggestions Wiki article for more details.

We’ve just started a project for converting the old method of
automatically translating strings, using the Machine Translation
feature, to a new system that will work for the new documentation. This
will save time for our translators.

There are still pending items: you can check the Status Page; any help
is very welcome.

The next step for the new quarter is to prepare and release the Website
translations through Weblate as well.
