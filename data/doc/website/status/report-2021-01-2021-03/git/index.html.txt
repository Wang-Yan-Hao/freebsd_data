The doc and src trees were migrated from Subversion to Git at the end of
2020, with some additional work extending into the first quarter of
2021. The Git Working Group implemented or updated commit hooks, and
prepared for FreeBSD 13 to be built from Git. We converted draft
documentation from Markdown to AsciiDoc and merged it into the
committer’s guide and handbook.

The ports repository migration to Git started at the end of the quarter,
beginning with a final Subversion commit on March 31st to indicate that
the conversion started. We are working on portsnap and other ports
infrastructure and they will be finished before or soon after the
migration.

The Git Working Group continues to track progress on two
permissively-licensed git compatible tools: Gitup and Game of Trees.
Gitup is a small, dependency-free tool to clone and update git
repositories. It is used only to keep a local tree up-to-date, and has
no support for local commits.

Game of Trees is a version control client that is compatible with Git
repositories. It provides a user interface and workflow that is distinct
from that of Git. It is in no way intended to be a drop-in replacement
for git, but can be used to develop software maintained in a Git
repository.

Gitup and Game of Trees are currently available as ports and packages.
Future work will evaluate them as candidates for the base system.

In the second quarter of 2021 we expect to complete some minor remaining
migration tasks. This will complete the initial phase of the Git
migration, and the working group will wind down. The core team will then
begin a new effort to investigate and evaluate new workflow changes.
