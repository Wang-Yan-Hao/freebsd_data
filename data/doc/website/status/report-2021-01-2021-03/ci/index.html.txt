The FreeBSD CI team maintains the continuous integration system of the
FreeBSD project. The CI system firstly checks the committed changes can
be successfully built, then performs various tests and analysis over the
newly built results. The artifacts from those builds are archived in the
artifact server for further testing and debugging needs. The CI team
members examine the failing builds and unstable tests and work with the
experts in that area to fix the code or adjust test infrastructure. The
details of these efforts are available in the weekly CI reports.

During the first quarter of 2021, we continued working with the
contributors and developers in the project to fulfil their testing needs
and also keep collaborating with external projects and companies to
improve their products and FreeBSD.

Important changes:

-   All src jobs were changed to use git to follow VCS migration. Thanks
    Brandon Bergren (bdragon@) again.

-   Doc job was updated for following the AsciiDoc migration.

New jobs added:

-   TCP test suite for main on amd64

-   GCC 9 build for main on amd64

Work in progress and open tasks:

-   Designing and implementing pre-commit CI building and testing

-   Designing and implementing use of CI cluster to build release
    artifacts as release engineering does

-   Collecting and sorting CI tasks and ideas here

-   Testing and merging pull requests in the FreeBSD-ci repo

-   Reducing the procedures of CI/test environment setting up for
    contributors and developers

-   Setting up the CI stage environment and putting the experimental
    jobs on it

-   Setting up public network access for the VM guest running tests

-   Implementing automatic tests on bare metal hardware

-   Adding drm ports building tests against -CURRENT

-   Planning to run ztest and network stack tests

-   Adding more external toolchain related jobs

-   Improving the hardware lab to be more mature and adding more
    hardware

-   Helping more software get FreeBSD support in their CI pipeline Wiki
    pages: 3rdPartySoftwareCI, HostedCI

-   Working with hosted CI providers to have better FreeBSD support

-   The build and test results will be sent to the dev-ci mailing list
    soon. Feedback and help with analysis is very appreciated!

Please see freebsd-testing@ related tickets for more WIP information,
and don’t hesitate to join the effort!
