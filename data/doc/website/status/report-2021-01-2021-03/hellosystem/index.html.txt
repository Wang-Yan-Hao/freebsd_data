What is helloSystem?

helloSystem is FreeBSD preconfigured as a desktop operating system with
a focus on simplicity, elegance, and usability. Its design follows the
“Less, but better” philosophy.

Q1 2021 Status

-   helloSystem and some of the motivations and core ideas behind it
    were presented at the FOSDEM 2021 BSD Devroom in the talk "hello…​
    again? Simplicity, elegance, and usability for the desktop". Video
    recordings of the talk and Q&A session are available WebM/VP9, mp4

-   Version 0.4.0 of helloSystem was published. Installable Live ISO
    images are available.

-   Work has started towards 0.5.0. We are beginning to see contributed
    features and bugfixes

    -   System menu reflects changes made in Applications immediately

    -   Filer file manager brings already-open windows to the front
        rather than opening multiple windows for the same folder

    -   Initial spatial mode option (each folder opens in its own window
        in the file manager that remembers its on-screen location)

Experimental and release builds of the Live ISO are available at
https://github.com/helloSystem/ISO/releases.

Contributing

Help is wanted in a number of areas, especially in the areas of the
FreeBSD core OS and kernel, and Qt/C++.
