What is CBSD?

CBSD is a management layer written for the FreeBSD jail(8) subsystem,
bhyve(8) and xen(4). CBSD allows users to manage jail/bhyve/xen
environments at different levels of abstraction by providing a varied
number of unified methods: vagrant-like CBSDfiles, CLI and via
dialog(1).

CBSD 2021Q1 Status Report

A RestAPI service layer was added during last quarter, enabling creation
of programmable cloud solutions. In addition, work has been done to
support RestAPI through a CBSDfile, allowing for private cloud
environments deployment. In such cases the local CBSD layer acts as a
thin client.
