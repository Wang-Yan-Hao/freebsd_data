Newer Intel Wireless device support

The Intel Wireless driver update project aims to bring support for newer
chipsets.

During the first quarter the driver and firmware were synched from
upstream so that we will have support for all modern cards currently
supported in Linux. Some iwlwifi driver changes were also submitted back
upstream.

Several conflicts with the original implementation of LinuxKPI were or
are being resolved and more LinuxKPI code was upstreamed to FreeBSD
HEAD.

LinuxKPI 802.11 compat code was improved and as of the day of writing we
have data packets going over 11a.

The plan for the next weeks is to clean things up, land as much as
possible in HEAD, provide the code for testing and work on stability
based on feedback before filling gaps in the LinuxKPI 802.11 compat code
to enhance support for more standards and features.
