Marvell ARM64 SoCs support

Contact: Zyta Szpak <zr@semihalf.com>

Contact: Marcin Wojtas <mw@semihalf.com>

The Semihalf team is working on improving the FreeBSD support for the
Marvell Octeon TX2 CN913x and Armada 7k/8k SoC families.

Marvell Armada 7k8k and Octeon TX2 CN913x SoC families are quad-core
64-bit ARMv8 Cortex-A72 processors with high speed peripherals including
10 Gb Ethernet, PCIe 3.0, SATA 3.0 and USB 3.0 for a wide range of
networking, storage, security and industrial applications.

Although the mentioned SoCs are mostly supported in FreeBSD HEAD, some
pieces required improvements.

Applied changes:

-   Add missing frequency modes in ap806_clock driver (commit
    a86b0839d7bf)

-   Multiple fixes in mvebu_gpio driver - in cooperation with mmel
    (commit a5dce53b75d8)

-   Fix device tree data parsing in mv\_ap806\_gicp interrupt controller
    driver (commit 622d17da46eb)

-   Rework the ICU interrupt controller (mv\_cp110\_icu) and its parent
    (mv\_ap806\_gicp), so that they no longer rely on the data provided
    by firmware, which fixes booting the OS from the newer U-Boot/TF-A
    revisions (D28803)

-   PCIE Designware driver (pci_dw) fixes:

    -   Correct setting of outbound I/O ATU window.

    -   Allow mapping ATU windows bigger than 4GB.

-   Generic improvements that enable proper user-space mapping and
    access of the PCI BARs

TODO:

-   Upstream PCIE improvements.

-   Improve and merge ICU support rework.
