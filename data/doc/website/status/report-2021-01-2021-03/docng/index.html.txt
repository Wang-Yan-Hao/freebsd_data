DOCNG on FreeBSD

Contact: Sergio Carlavilla <carlavilla@FreeBSD.org>

The Doc New Generation project is finished. The switch-over date was
Saturday, January 23rd.

But there’s a list of remaining tasks:

-   Convert the Python scripts to Ruby using the AsciiDoctor API

-   Convert from releases from 4.4 to 9.0 to AsciiDoctor

-   Use rouge in the source sections instead of the CSS hack

-   Split the news page to reduce the total size of the page

-   Split the books

-   Improve the FDP book

If you want to reduce the TODO list, give me a ping :)
