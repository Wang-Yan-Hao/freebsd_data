The Ports Management Team is responsible for overseeing the overall
direction of the Ports Tree, building packages, and personnel matters.
Below is what happened in the last quarter.

As always, first the quarterly dashboard: * we currently have around
43,800 ports (including flavors). * the open PR count for ports is
currently 2477, of which 532 are unassigned. * during the last quarter,
9481 commits were made by 168 committers on the main branch, and 620
commits by 64 committers on the 2021Q1 branch. Compared to 2020Q4, the
number of ports again grew by five percent, the number of open PRs
dropped a bit, and the number of commits on the main branch grew with
almost nine percent.

During the last quarter, we welcomed Neel Chauhan (nc@), Lewis Cook
(lcook@), and Nuno Teixeira (eduardo@). Adrian Chadd (adrian@) who is
already a src committer got a ports commit bit extension. Tobias Berner
(tcberner@) asked if he could join the portmgr-lurker program and was
shortly added afterwards.

We sent another mail to the ports@ mailing list outlining further plans
for removing Python 2.7 from the Ports Tree. Currently all ports
recursively depending on Python 2.7 are marked to expire on 2021-06-23,
which unfortunately includes a lot of KDE ports due to the qt5-webengine
port. We are evaluating various mitigation strategies.

portmgr has been collaborating with the Git Working Group over the last
year to prepare the Ports Tree to be converted to Git. Tasks included: *
converting various scripts and tools to support Git * attending Git
Working Group meetings * updating documentation * updating various
internal and public third-party services * evaluating numerous test
conversion (git-beta) results

Regarding the Ports Tree itself, two new USES were introduced: * kodi to
ease porting of Kodi add-ons * mpi for dependencies of MPICH and OpenMPI
A new default version for ImageMagick was added and the default version
for Julia was removed as no Julia port currently exists. pkg was updated
to 1.16.3, Firefox to 87.0, and Chromium to 89.0.4389.114

The Cluster Administration Team assisted with getting three new package
building machines running in the build cluster. Two are for arm64 builds
and one is a general builder.

antoine@ was again busy with exp-runs, 28 this time, to: * test various
ports updates * update the clang/LLVM version from 6 to 10 in
USES=compiler * reduce includes in /usr/include/crypto
