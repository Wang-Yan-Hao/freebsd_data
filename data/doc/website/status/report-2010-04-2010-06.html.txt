Binary Package Patch Infrastructure — pkg_patch

  ----------- --------------------------------------------------

  Wiki page   URL: http://wiki.FreeBSD.org/IvanVoras/pkg_patch
  ----------- --------------------------------------------------

Contact: Ivan Voras <ivoras@FreeBSD.org>

The pkg_patch project is about creating a binary package patch
infrastructure which would allow users to patch their live system's
packages in an easy and efficient way. It is a C program written to
interface with libpkg (for things which are common to all pkg utilities)
meant to be included in the base system when it is done. It comes with
built-in mass patch creation and application commands. It is funded by
Google Summer of Code 2010.

Open tasks:

1.  Finish the project.
2.  Get some testing for it.
3.  Convince the Ports Management Team it is actually a Good Thing to
    have even as an experimental feature.
4.  Agree upon the policy on which package patches will be created (i.e.
    from which point in time to which point in time), assuming the
    "stable" package tree idea has still not gotten traction.

Contact: Gábor Kövesdán <gabor@FreeBSD.org>

The SGI IRIX operating system has a concept, called job, which is used
to group processes together and then apply resource limits on them. The
purpose of this project is to implement this facility on FreeBSD.

I spent most of the time familiarizing myself with how things are done
inside the kernel, how syscalls work, etc. So far, I have the basic
understanding needed and I added the most important syscalls to group
processes together into jobs and manipulate collective resource limits
on them.

There is a bug, which I am tracking down at the moment, after this I can
start to implement actual resource limit enforcement. For some of the
limit types, it will be relatively easy but some others will take more
effort and studies.

Open tasks:

1.  Fix the showstopper bug, which prevent me working on actual limit
    enforcement.
2.  Implement limit enforcements for all of the limits supported by
    IRIX.
3.  Add support for userland facilities and make utilities jobs-aware,
    like showing jobs in ps(1), etc.

This project has two goals: pre-allocation algorithm and ext4 read-only
mode.

The aim of pre-allocation algorithm is to implement a reservation window
mechanism. Now this mechanism has been introduced. The performance
comparison can be found on the wiki.

The aim of ext4 read-only mode is to make it possible to read ext4 file
system in read-only mode when the hard disk is formatted with default
features. Currently it only supports a few features, such as extents,
huge_file. Others features will be added, such as dir_index, uninit_bg,
dir_nlink, flex_bg and extra_isize. My work resides in extfs and ext4fs
branch of Perforce.

File System Changes Notification

Contact: Ilya Putsikau <iputsikau@gmail.com>

The aim of the project is to implement an inotify-compatible file system
change notification mechanism for FreeBSD and later, and add inotify
support to linuxulator. The result, fsnotify is already functional but
not yet compatible with inotify in some details.

Open tasks:

1.  Add access permissions checks.
2.  Port inotify test cases.
3.  Fix compatibility issues.
4.  Add linuxulator support.

  ----------------------- -----------------------------------------------------

Contact: Andrius Morkunas <hinokind@gmail.com>

First part of the project is mostly complete. I added support for new
PORTS_CC variable which should be used in make.conf instead of CC to
change ports compiler. This allows user to change ports compiler easily,
while still respecting USE_GCC.

Some patches were written to get ports to work with Clang, and a lot of
old patches written prior to the Google Summer of Code project were
updated. There are still a lot of broken ports, and some that cannot be
built because of Clang/LLVM bugs, but at this point, Clang can build
most ports.

Open tasks:

1.  Fix broken ports that do not work with Clang.
2.  Test patched ports with Clang, report Clang bugs.

I have been reimplementing VFS namecache to make it granularly locked
and supporting reliable full-path lookup without calling underlying file
system routines. I have successfully implemented directory cache that
works in idealized environment with tmpfs. I am currently working on
adding support for entries without associated vnodes and for "weak"
entries and incomplete cached path.

  ------------------- ---------------------------------------------------

Contact: David Forsythe <dforsyth@FreeBSD.org>

The libpkg library will allow for fairly fine grained control over
package management.

Presently libpkg has complete read functionality. Info and delete tools
that have most of the current package tool features have already been
implemented, and once they are completed they can be considered
replacements for their counterparts.

Once the write and logging aspects of the library are more mature, add
and create tools can be created quickly. A new set of more maintainable
package tools that leverage libpkg will hopefully be available soon
after.

Packet-Capturing Stack — ringmap

  ----------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------

Contact: Alexander Fiveg <afiveg@FreeBSD.org>

The ringmap stack is a complete FreeBSD packet-capturing mplementation
specialized for very high-speed networks. Similar to the "zero-copy BPF"
implementation, the idea of ringmap is to eliminate packet copy
operations by using shared memory buffers. However, unlike the
"zero-copy BPF" model, ringmap eliminates ALL packet copies during
capturing: the network adapter's DMA buffer is mapped directly into
user-space. The ringmap stack also adapts libpcap accordingly to provide
userspace applications with access to the captured packets without any
additional overhead.

In the context of Google Summer of Code 2010:

-   The ringmap software was ported to 9-CURRENT.
-   Ringmap was redesigned to make it easier to port to other adapters
    and to integrate it with other network drivers.
-   Also ringmap was extended to be multi-threaded.

Open tasks:

1.  Porting ringmap to 10GbE (integrating with ixgbe driver).
2.  Porting the entire ringmap code from 9-CURRENT to -STABLE.
3.  Evaluation tests.
4.  Documentation.

Contact: Ed Schouten <ed@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Roman Divacky <rdivacky@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Brooks Davis <brooks@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Pawel Worach <pawel.worach@gmail.com>

In the past quarter we imported Clang into FreeBSD and it is being built
by default on i386/amd64/powerpc. We have not yet committed the
necessary changes to let world compile with Clang.

Some bugs and warnings were fixed in HEAD as a result of the Clang
import and people are exploring more and more areas (DTrace, etc). There
are some bug fixes in Clang/LLVM as well that stem from the import
(unknown pragmas warnings, etc).

Roman Divacky and Matthew Fleming are working on ELF writer in LLVM.
This is meant as a replacement for assembler (currently we use an
outdated GNU as(1)). This work is progressing nice, currently it is able
to produce working variants of hello world in C and C++, and some other
small programs from "configure run".

Open tasks:

1.  Import of newer Clang/LLVM into HEAD.
2.  Help with ARM/MIPS/SPARC64.
3.  Start pushing src patches into HEAD.
4.  More testing of Clang on third-party applications (ports).
5.  More work on the ELF writer.

Contact: Max Khon <fjoe@samodelkin.net>

The purpose of DAHDI/FreeBSD project is to make it possible to use
FreeBSD as a base system for software PBX solutions.

DAHDI (Digium/Asterisk Hardware Device Interface) is an open-source
device driver framework and a set of hardware drivers for E1/T1, ISDN
digital, and FXO/FXS analog cards [1]. Asterisk is one of the most
popular open-source software PBX solutions [2].

The project includes porting DAHDI framework and hardware drivers for
E1/T1, FXO/FXS analog, and ISDN digital cards to FreeBSD. This also
includes TDMoE support, software and HW echo cancellation (Octasic,
VPMADT032), and hardware transcoding support (TC400B). The work is
ongoing in the official DAHDI SVN repository with the close
collaboration with DAHDI folks at Digium.

The project is nearing completion. The DAHDI framework and hardware
drivers telephony cards have been ported and tested. There are a number
of success stories from early adopters who have been using E1/T1 and
FXO/FXS cards on FreeBSD for several months.

90% of the functionality is working, the daemons sync two systems in a
master-slave paradigm.

Open tasks:

1.  Standardize the code to meet FreeBSD requirements.
2.  Implement SSL in network communication.
3.  Perform security improvements and bug fixing, strlxxx() functions,
    memcpy() instead of strcpy() when using non-char variables.
4.  Integrate with the current Audit subsystem.

This project purpose is adding support for general purpose DMA engines
found in most embedded devices. GPDMA framework provides a unified KOBJ
interface to DMA engine drivers and unified programming interface to use
direct memory transfers in kernel and userspace applications.

This project is a part of Google Summer of Code 2010 and it is a work in
progress. Current status can be observed on the wiki page.

Open tasks:

1.  Add support for more DMA engines.
2.  Complete, clean up, and merge with HEAD.

GEOM-Based Pseudo-RAID Implementation — geom_pseudoraid

  Code snapshot   URL: http://acm.poly.edu/~spawk/geom_pseudoraid-20100715.tbz

Contact: Boris Kochergin <spawk@acm.poly.edu>

The old ata(4) driver is believed to be going away sometime in the
future, to be replaced with ATA_CAM [1]. However, ATA pseudo-RAID
support in FreeBSD, ataraid(4), is implemented as part of said ata(4)
driver, which means that it, too, will be going away. It was decided
that pseudo-RAID support is desirable and that it should be
reimplemented in GEOM [2] [3], which this project aims to do.

Currently, RAID-1 arrays can be used on VIA Tech V-RAID and Adaptec
HostRAID controllers in a limited capacity. There is no support for
writing metadata yet, so disks are not marked degraded, there is no
rebuild support, etc. These features are planned, along with support for
more hardware and RAID-0 and SPAN arrays.

A major setback for the current code is that it uses the device(9)
family of functions to identify ATA pseudo-RAID controllers and
constructs arrays based on that information. Unfortunately, ATA_CAM does
not appear to add its devices to the device tree, so that tactic cannot
be used with ATA_CAM. While this is fine for development of the actual
RAID parts of the code, the project will be somewhat useless in the
absence of the old ata(4) driver. There has been talk of exporting PCI
information to GEOM [4] [5], but the work does not appear to have been
completed yet.

Open tasks:

1.  Obtain documentation for or reverse-engineer metadata formats for
    which there is no write support in the ataraid(4) driver (for
    example, Adaptec HostRAID).
2.  Add CAM support for exporting PCI information to GEOM.

Implementation of General Purpose Input/Output interface for FreeBSD.
Current GPIO bus implementation allows user to control pins from
userland and it could be expanded to support various type of peripheral
devices. So far there are two drivers:

-   gpioled provides simple led(4) functionality.
-   gpioiic implements I2C over GPIO.

Framework is used in Alexandr Rybalko's port of FreeBSD to D-Link
DIR-320 and in Luis Otavio O Souza's work of bringing FreeBSD to
RouterBoard.

New System Installer — pc-sysinstall

Contact: M. Warner Losh <imp@FreeBSD.org>

The new system installation backend, pc-sysinstall, was merged into HEAD
recently and work is already underway to make it more functional and
useful as a complete replacement to standard "sysinstall". It is written
100% in shell, not requiring any additional tools from what is standard
to FreeBSD. The backend already supports a number of exciting features
such as:

-   ZFS (Including support for raidz/mirror/multiple device pool
    setups).
-   Disk encryption via GELI(8).
-   Auto labeling of file systems with glabel(8).
-   Big disk support using GPT/EFI.
-   Full Installation Logging, which is saved to disk for post-install
    inspection.

In addition to the features above, pc-sysinstall is unique, in that
every install ends up being a scripted install. Front-ends, be it GUI-
or text-based, simply generate the appropriate system configuration
file, and pc-sysinstall does the grunt work of the actual installation.
This is important for a couple of reasons. First, it makes the task of
front-end development much easier by not needing to worry about a
backend-driven program flow. Second it means that any front-end can be
used to generate the installation configuration file, which can then be
copied or modified to perform automated installs.

While pc-sysinstall is still relatively new, it is already in use as the
default backend for PC-BSD 8.0 and 8.1, and has been getting a very good
reception and any bugs found are fixed quickly. A text-based front-end
is already in the works which will allow installation media to be
created without X11 support.

AFS is a distributed network filesystem that originated from the Andrew
Project at Carnegie-Mellon University; the OpenAFS client implementation
has not been particularly useful on FreeBSD since the 4.X releases.
Recent work on the OpenAFS codebase has updated it to be consistent with
current versions of FreeBSD, and the client, though still considered
experimental, is now relatively stable for light (single-threaded) use
on 9-CURRENT. The auxiliary utilities for managing and examining the
filesystem are functional, and reading and writing files works
sufficiently well to copy /usr/src into and out of AFS. Compiling and
running executables in AFS is unsuccessful, though, as mmap() is not
always reliable.

There are several known outstanding issues that are being worked on, but
detailed bug reports are welcome at port-freebsd@openafs.org.

Open tasks:

1.  Fix the {get,put}pages vnode operations for more reliable mmap()
    operation.
2.  Update VFS locking to allow the use of disk-based client caches as
    well as memory-based caches.
3.  Track down races and deadlocks that appear under load.
4.  Integrate with the bsd.kmod.mk kernel-module build infrastructure.

Resource Containers

Contact: Edward Tomasz Napierała <trasz@FreeBSD.org>

As of now, FreeBSD only offers very rudimentary resource controls —
resource limits for many resources (e.g. SysV IPC) are missing, and
there is no way to set resource limits for jails. As a result, users who
want to run many different workloads on a single physical machine often
have to replace jails with several FreeBSD instances running in virtual
machines.

The goal of this project is to implement resource containers and a
simple per-jail resource limits mechanism. Resource containers are also
a prerequisite for other resource management mechanisms, such as
Hierarchical Resource Limits, for "Collective Limits on Set of Processes
(aka. Jobs)" Google Summer of Code 2010 project, for implementing
mechanism similar to Linux cgroups, and might be also used to e.g.
provide precise resource usage accounting for administrative or billing
purposes.

This project is being sponsored by The FreeBSD Foundation.

Some bug fixes were applied, and the code was also tested and made to
work with the cuse4bsd webcam driver, which supports a great many camera
chipsets.

The code is still only in 9-CURRENT. We were going to MFC it to 8.x but
ran into the code freeze for 8.1, so missed that. However, the code does
work on 8-STABLE. We will try to get it MFC'd for 8.2.

After a long hiatus, we aim to hold a bugathon on the weekend of the
6th - 9th August. Everybody is welcome to help resolve or progress PRs
from the database. We appreciate the help of committers and
non-committers alike, please join us on IRC in #freebsd-bugbusters on
EFnet if you are free at any time over that weekend and can help. Please
see the "Bugathon" URL for more information.

Mark Linimon and Gavin Atkinson held a session on the State of
Bugbusting at BSDCan, which was well attended and led to some
interesting discussions. Time was also found to sit down with several
committers to discuss long-standing PRs.

The bugbusting team continue work on trying to make the GNATS PR
database more accessible and easier for committers to find and resolve
PRs.

As a result, PRs continue to be classified as they arrive, by adding
'tags' to the subject lines corresponding to the kernel subsystem
involved, or man page references for userland PRs. Reports are generated
from these nightly, grouping related PRs in one place, sorted by tag or
man page. Mark Linimon continues work on producing a new report, Summary
Chart of PRs with Tags, which sorts tagged PRs into logical groups such
as file system, network drivers, libraries, and so forth. The slice
labels are clickable and may further subdivide the groups. The chart is
updated once a day. You can consider it as a prototype for browsing
"subcategories" of kernel PRs.

The "recommended list" has been split up into "non-trivial PRs which
need committer evaluation" and the "easy list" of trivial PRs, to try to
focus some attention on the latter. Various new reports exist, including
"PRs containing code for new device drivers", "PRs which are from
FreeBSD vendors or OEMs", and "PRs referencing other BSDs".

It is now possible for interested parties to be emailed a weekly,
customized, report similar in style to the above. If you are interested
in setting one up, contact linimon@FreeBSD.org.

Our clearance rate of PRs, especially in kern and bin, seems to be
improving. The number of non-ports PRs has stayed almost constant since
the last status report.

As always, anybody interested in helping out with the PR queue is
welcome to join us in #freebsd-bugbusters on EFnet. We are always
looking for additional help, whether your interests lie in triaging
incoming PRs, generating patches to resolve existing problems, or simply
helping with the database housekeeping (identifying duplicate PRs, ones
that have already been resolved, etc). This is a great way of getting
more involved with FreeBSD!

Open tasks:

1.  Plan and manage the bugathon in August, and get as many people as
    possible interested in participating.
2.  Try to find ways to get more committers helping us with closing PRs
    that the team has already analyzed.

FreeBSD Core Team Election

Contact: Core Team <core@FreeBSD.org>

The 2010 FreeBSD core team election was recently completed. The FreeBSD
core team acts as the project's "board of directors" and is responsible
for approving new src committers, resolving disputes between developers,
appointing sub-committees for specific purposes (security officer,
release engineering, port managers, webmaster, et cetera), and making
any other administrative or policy decisions as needed. The core team
has been elected by FreeBSD developers every 2 years since 2000, and
this marks our 6th democratically elected core team.

The new core team would like to thank outgoing members Kris Kennaway,
Giorgos Keramidas, George V. Neville-Neil, Murray Stokely, and Peter
Wemm for their service over the past two (and in some cases, many more)
years.

The core team would also especially like to thank Dag-Erling Smøgrav for
running the election.

The newly elected core team members are:

-   John Baldwin
-   Konstantin Belousov
-   Warner Losh
-   Pav Lucistnik
-   Colin Percival

The returning core team members are:

-   Wilko Bulte
-   Brooks Davis

This project is about creating a wrapper library to support monitoring
and management of networking with avoiding direct use of the FreeBSD
kvm(3) and sysctl(3) interfaces. This approach would allow the kernel
implementation to change and monitoring applications to be extended
without breaking applications and requiring them to be recompiled. We
decided to merge the sources from the last year's Summer of Code project
back to the FreeBSD src/ repository piece by piece, and we have defined
several phases of integration.

-   Standardize the in-kernel networking statistics structures.
-   Build a sysctl(3) interface, and add export routines.
-   Add a library, libnetstat(3) to work with the exported information,
    and to provide further functions in order to support extracting
    information via kvm(3). This library implements abstractions over
    the gathered data.
-   Adapt sources of the existing applications, i.e. netstat(1) and
    bsnmpd(1) to use the abstractions offered by the library, resulting
    in a cleaner and simpler code.
-   Add new applications on the top of the library, e.g. nettop(1).

The first phase has been already posted for review. Note that we are
looking for a sponsor with an src commit bit and enough time to
represent the effort towards the Project.

Open tasks:

1.  Review the sources.
2.  Pick a task from the list, and send patches.
3.  Comment the patches, help them to improve.

Kernel

Interrupt Threads

Contact: John Baldwin <jhb@FreeBSD.org>

For a while I have wanted to rework interrupt threads to address a few
issues. The new design uses per-CPU queues of interrupt handlers.
Interrupt threads are allocated by a CPU from a pool and bound to that
CPU while draining that CPU's queue of handlers. Non-filter handlers can
also reschedule themselves at the back of the current CPU's queue while
executing. Filters with handlers are now always enabled and should
provide a full replacement for the various uses of filters with "fast"
taskqueues. A new class of "manual" handlers are also available which
are not automatically scheduled, but are only explicitly scheduled from
a filter. Thus, a filter can potentially schedule multiple handlers.

The code has been tested on amd64, but it needs wider review and
testing. I hope to start soliciting review and feedback soon with the
goal of getting the code into 9.0.

  --------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contact: Bjoern A. Zeeb <bz@FreeBSD.org>

The project started with some cleanup on the network stack after all the
import work and adjustments for virtualization to minimize changes to
earlier branches. These made it into the tree already and to 8-STABLE,
and it will be included in the upcoming 8.1 release.

The first major task was to generalize the virtualization framework, so
that virtualization of further subsystems would be easier and could be
achieved with less duplication.

In addition some documentation on the virtual network stack programming
was written to help developers virtualizing their code. The interactive
kernel debugger support was improved and libjail along with jls and
netstat can work on core dumps now and query individual jails and
attached virtual network stacks.

The second major task was network stack teardown, a concept introduced
with the network stack virtualization. The primary goal was to prototype
a shutdown of the (virtual) network stacks from top to bottom, which
means letting interfaces go last rather than first. Work in this area is
still in progress and will have to continue to allow long term stability
and a leak and panic free shutdown.

The work on this project had been sponsored by the FreeBSD Foundation
and CK Software GmbH. Special thanks also to John Baldwin and Philip
Paeps for helping with review and suggestions.

Open tasks:

1.  Merge stabilised change sets.
2.  Work further down the network stack freeing all resources for a
    stable, safe teardown.

Kernel Event Timers Infrastructure

Contact: Alexander Motin <mav@FreeBSD.org>

Modern x86 systems include four different types of event timers: i8254,
RTC, LAPIC, and HPET. First three are already supported by FreeBSD.
Depending on hardware and loader tunables, periodic interrupts from them
are used to trigger all time-based events in kernel. That code has a
long history, that made it tangled and at the same time limited and
hard-coded.

New kernel event timers infrastructure was started to allow different
event timer hardware to be operated in uniform way and to allow more
features to be supported. Work consists of three main parts: writing
machine-independent timer driver API and management code, updating
existing drivers and improving HPET driver to support event timers.

The new driver API provides unified support for both per-CPU
(independent for every CPU core) and global timers in periodic and
one-shot modes. Management code at this moment uses only periodic mode,
while one-shot mode use is planned by later tickless kernel work.

Different kinds of timers have different capabilities and could be
present in hardware in different combinations. In every situation the
infrastructure automatically chooses two best event timers to supply
system with hardclock(), statclock(), and profclock() events. If some
timer is not functioning — it will be replaced. If there is no second
timer — it will be emulated. The administrator may affect that choice
using loader tunables during boot and sysctl variables in run-time
(kern.eventtimer.*, and so on).

Most of the code was recently committed to HEAD. Now it is used by i386
and amd64 architectures.

Open tasks:

1.  Troubleshoot possible hardware and software issues.
2.  Port other architectures to the new infrastructure.
3.  Implement tickless kernel, utilizing new features, such as per-CPU
    and one-shot timers.

the from-scratch translation of the MAC chapter of the German handbook.
We thank them both for their contributions and hope they will continue
their efforts to enhance the German documentation.

Frank Börner was released from Benedicts mentorship and is now a full
committer to the German Documentation Project. We are always looking for
fresh blood that is willing to be mentored by us as a first step in
becoming committers for the documentation project themselves.

Johann is keeping up the German website with the latest version. But we

functionality is not even documented in the GNU version so few
applications might use it.

FreeBSD Services Control — fsc

          URL: http://people.FreeBSD.org/~trhodes/fsc/
  ------- ----------------------------------------------

Contact: Tom Rhodes <trhodes@FreeBSD.org>

FreeBSD Services Control is a mix of binaries which integrate into the
rc.d system and provide for service (daemon) monitoring. It knows about
signals, pidfiles, and uses very few resources.

The fsc daemon (fscd) runs in the background once the system has
started. Services are then added to this daemon via the fscadm control
utility, and from there they will be monitored. When they die, depending
on the reason, they will be restarted. Certain signals may be ignored
(list not decided) and fscd will remove that service from monitoring.
Every action is logged to the system logging daemon. Additionally, the
fscadm utility may be used to inquire about what services are monitored,
their pidfile location, and current process ID.

FSC provides several advantages over the third-party daemontools
package. For example, fscd uses push notifications instead of polling;
fscd is an internal, FreeBSD-maintained software package accessible to
all developers, where daemontools would have to be a port and require us
to maintain patches; fscd could be easily integrated with the current
rc.d infrastructure.

Partially based on the ideas of daemontools and Solaris Service Service
Mangement Facility (SMF), this could be an extremely useful tool for
FreeBSD systems.

Open tasks:

1.  Testing. Get feedback on how it works in various environments.
2.  Code review.
3.  Other ideas on the rc.d integration.
4.  Update the manual pages.

Flattened Device Tree for Embedded FreeBSD

  -------------------- --------------------------------------------------
  Links                
  Project wiki pages   URL: http://wiki.FreeBSD.org/FlattenedDeviceTree
  -------------------- --------------------------------------------------

Contact: Rafal Jaworowski <raj@semihalf.com>

The purpose of this project was to provide FreeBSD with support for the
Flattened Device Tree (FDT) technology. A mechanism for describing
computer hardware resources, which cannot be probed or self enumerated,
in a uniform and portable way. The primary consumers of this technology
are embedded FreeBSD platforms (ARM, MIPS, PowerPC), where a lot of
designs are based on similar chips, but have different assignment of
pins, memory layout, addresses ranges, interrupts routing and other
resources.

Current state highlights:

-   All code and documentation developed during the course of this
    project was merged with HEAD, which covers FDT support for the
    following platforms and systems:

-   Marvell ARM

-   -   DB-88F5182
    -   DB-88F5281
    -   DB-88F6281
    -   DB-78100
    -   SheevaPlug

-   Freescale PowerPC

-   -   MPC8555CDS
    -   MPC8572DS

-   The FDT infrastructure (bus drivers, helper libraries, and routines
    shared across architectures and platforms) allows for easier porting
    to new platforms or variations. The initially supported systems
    offer a working example of how to migrate towards FDT approach.

Work on this project was sponsored by the FreeBSD Foundation.

Open tasks:

1.  Improve how-to and guidelines for new adopters (how to convert to
    FDT and so on).
2.  Migrate more existing embedded FreeBSD platforms (ARM, MIPS) to FDT
    approach.

host have been fixed, buildkernel succeeds, buildworld succeeds with
some exceptions. Next step would be fixing pmap and bringing port back
to single-user stage.

On July 13, FreeBSD/powerpc64 was integrated into HEAD. This provides
support for fully 64-bit operation on 64-bit PowerPC machines conforming
to the Book-S specification, including the PowerPC 970, Cell, and
POWER4-7. Hardware support is currently limited to Apple machines,
although this should expand in the near future.

Currently supported hardware:

-   Apple Xserve G5
-   Apple Power Macintosh G5
-   Apple iMac G5

FreeBSD/sparc64

Contact: Marius Strobl <marius@FreeBSD.org>

Since the last status report some issues with cas(4) have been fixed,
allowing it to work with Sun GigaSwift Ethernet 1.0 MMF cards (Cassini
Kuheen, part no. 501-5524) as well as the on-board interfaces of Sun
Fire B100s server blades (for the Sun Fire B1600 platform).

Support for Fujitsu (Siemens) PRIMEPOWER 250 based on SPARC64 V CPUs has
been added. PRIMEPOWER 450, 650, and 850 likely also work but have not
been tested. This also means that the building blocks for support of
machines based on SPARC64 VI and VII CPUs like the Fujitsu/Sun SPARC
Enterprise Mx000 series are now in place, but they need testing as well.

The problems with Schizo version 7 bridges (actually the firmware of
these machines) triggering panics during boot finally should be solved.

The work on getting Sun Fire V1280 supported has been stalled due to
access to such machines no longer being available.

The above mentioned improvements are/will be available in FreeBSD
8.1-RELEASE and 7.4-RELEASE.

Open tasks:

1.  Access to machines based on SPARC64 VI and VII CPUs, like the
    Fujitsu/Sun SPARC Enterprise Mx000 series would be appreciated.
2.  Someone adding support for 64-bit SPARC V9 to Clang/LLVM, and
    getting it on par with GCC would be appreciated.

Contact: Ruben <chromium@hybridsource.org>

Chromium is a Webkit-based web browser that is largely BSD-licensed. It
works very well on FreeBSD and supports new features like HTML 5 video.
This effort uses a new hybrid-source model, where the FreeBSD patches
are largely kept closed for a limited time. I submitted Chromium to
ports a couple of months ago and recently updated the submission to the
stable 5.0.375 branch. The port is ready to be committed pending final
legal approval by the FreeBSD Foundation. Further work remains to port
Chromium to FreeBSD completely, such as porting the task manager fully
and making sure extensions work properly.

Our efforts on porting the generalized, general-purpose purely
functional programming language, Haskell has rallied, since two new
committers, Giuseppe Pilichi and Ashish Shukla joined recently, forming
the FreeBSD Haskell Team. Over the last months, FreeBSD/i386 and
FreeBSD/amd64 have become Tier-1 platforms, featuring officially
supported vanilla binary distributions for the Glasgow Haskell Compiler
starting from version 6.12.1. We introduced a unified ports
infrastructure for Haskell Cabal ports, which also makes possible the
direct translation of Cabal package descriptions to FreeBSD ports. The
number of Haskell package ports increases steadily.

Open tasks:

1.  Improve support for Haskell Cabal packages and their translation.
2.  Create a port for Haskell Platform.
3.  Add more Haskell package ports.
4.  Test and send feedback.

A significant part of quarter two was spent coordinating efforts for
inclusion of Xorg 7.5, KDE 4, GNOME 2, plus preparation of ports for the
8.1 release process. Due to the success of enforcing Feature Safe ports
commits during 7.3-RELEASE, it was continued for the recent src/ freeze.

The port count is approaching 22,000 ports. The open PR count currently
floats at about 1200 entries.

Since the last report, we added four new committers, and had two old
committers rejoin us.

The Ports Management Team is very grateful to the FreeBSD Foundation for
sponsoring two new head nodes for the ports building cluster, pointyhat.
Each of the new head nodes has a larger capacity, both with regard to
performance but also in amount of space available for the staging areas,
allowing for faster, and thus more, build cycles. Additionally, having
two head nodes will allow us to dedicate one of them for building
production-ready binary packages, adding predicability for our users to
when what types of packages are available for installation, and dedicate
the other for regression testing of large port updates, ports
infrastructure improvements, the cluster scheduling code, and FreeBSD
itself. Over the last few weeks, Mark Linimon has been working hard to
get the first of the two new nodes online and has already completed its
first package build. This has involved a substantial rework of our
custom codebase.

The Ports Management team have been running -exp runs on an ongoing
basis, verifying how base system updates may affect the ports tree, as
well as providing QA runs for major ports updates. Of note, -exp runs
were done for:

-   ale: Update of math/gmp.
-   delphij: Changes to Mk/bsd.ldap.mk.
-   gahr: Inclusion of USE_GL=glew.
-   pgollucci: Changes to Mk/bsd.*apache.mk plus updates to devel/apr
    and www/apache*.
-   Testing of x11/xorg, x11/gnome2, x11/kde4, and lang/mono
-   A test run make fetch run.
-   A test run for devel/gettext.
-   mm: Inclusion of USE_XZ.
-   ale: Request to switch default mysql from 5.0-EOL to 5.1-GA.

alepulver's Licensing Framework Summer of Code project has made it into
the tree and the Ports Management Team is currently assessing the
fallout and it will come up with guidelines and documentation in due
time.

Open tasks:

1.  Looking for help fixing ports broken on 9-CURRENT.
2.  Looking for help with Tier-2 architectures.
3.  Most ports PRs are assigned, we now need to focus on testing,
    committing, and closing.

          URL: http://wiki.freebsd.org/BSDDay_2010
  ------- ------------------------------------------

Contact: Gábor Páli <pgj@FreeBSD.org>

The purpose of this one-day event is to gather Central European
developers of today's open-source BSD systems to popularize their work
and their organization, and to provide an interface for real-life
communication. There are no formalities, no papers, and no registration
or participation fee. However the invited developers are encouraged to
give a talk on their favorite BSD-related topic or join the live forum,
then have a beer with the other folks around. The goal is to motivate
potential future developers and users, especially undergraduate
university students to work with BSD systems.

This year's BSD-Day will be held in Budapest, Hungary at Eötvös Loránd
University, Faculty of Informatics on November 20, 2010.

Open tasks:

1.  Apply as a developer, we are still looking for BSD people in the
    area.

BSDCan 2010 was our 7th conference. As has become the custom, a FreeBSD
developer summit was held in the two days before the conference. Record
numbers attended the Dev Summit which carried over into the conference
proper. It was great to see representatives from so many more companies.
I saw many great ideas take root and the start of cooperation on several
projects.

The talks during the Dev Summit are beginning to attract a wider
audience, and we have been talking about opening this up to the general
audience by creating a fourth track at BSDCan 2011.

As impossible as it sounds, each year has seen an increase in the
quality of talks and the number of proposals submitted.

Open tasks:

1.  I need people to help with various pre-conference tasks: website
    updates, booking travel, etc.

meetBSD 2010 took place on July 2 - 3 in Krakow, Poland at the Faculty
of Mathematics and Computer Science building of the Jagiellonian
University.

The gathering was a much successful event which brought together
developers, contributors, and users of the BSD systems from around the
world. We had many interesting presentations, of various character and
appeal for the diversified audience.

Attendees had a chance for taking the BSD Certification exam during the
conference, as well as the advantage of face to face side conversations
and discussions, which continued long during the social event on Friday
night!

The conference presentation slides are already available for download.
Video recordings edition is being finalized, and their publication is
expected shortly.

We hope you enjoyed the event and had great time in Krakow. See you
again soon!
