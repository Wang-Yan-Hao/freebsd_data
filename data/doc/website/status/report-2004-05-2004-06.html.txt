Introduction

This installment of the Bi-Monthly Status Report is a few days late, but
I'm pleased to say that it is chocked full of over 30 articles. May and
June were yet again busy months; the Netperf project passed major
milestones and can now be run with the debug.mpsafenet tunable turned on
from sources in CVS. The ARM, MIPS, and PPC ports saw quite a bit of
progress, as did several other SMPng and Netgraph projects. FreeBSD 5.3
is just around the corner, so don't hesitate to grab a snapshot and test
the progress!

On a more serious note, it's very important to remember that code freeze
for FreeBSD 5.3 will happen on August 15, 2004. This is only a few weeks
away and there is still a lot to do. The TODO list for the release can
be found at http://www.freebsd.org/releases/5.3R/todo.html. If you are
looking for a way to contribute to the release, this TODO list has
several items that are in urgent and in need of attention. Testing is
also very important. The tree has had some stability stability problems
in the past few weeks, but there are work-arounds that should allow
everyone to continue testing and using FreeBSD. We absolutely must have
FreeBSD 5.3 be a rock-solid release, so every little bit of contributed
effort helps!

Thanks,

Scott Long

  -------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------

Contact: Max Laier <mlaier@FreeBSD.org>

The ALTQ framework is part of KAME for more than 4 years and has been
adopted by Net- and OpenBSD since more than 3 years. It provides means
of managing outgoing packets to do QoS and bandwidth limitations.
OpenBSD developed a different way to interact with ALTQ using pf, which
was adopted by KAME as the "default for everyday use".

The Romanian FreeBSD Users Group has had a project to work towards
integration of ALTQ into FreeBSD, which provided a very good starting
point for the final import. The import only provides the "pf mode"
configuration and classification API as the older ALTQ3 API does not
suit to our SMP approach.

A reworked configuration API (decoupled from pf) is in the making as are
additional driver modifications. Both should be done before 5-STABLE is
branched, although additional drivers can be imported during the
lifetime of 5-STABLE as well.

Buf Junta project

Contact: Poul-Henning Kamp <phk@FreeBSD.org>

The buf-junta project is underway, I am trying to bisect the code such
that we get a struct bufobj which is the handle and method carrier for a
buffer-cache object. All vnodes contain a bufobj, but as filesystems get
migrated to GEOM backing, bufobj's will exist which do not have an
associated vnode. The work is ongoing.

CAM Lockdown

Contact: Scott Long <scottl@freebsd.org>

Not much coding has taken place on this lately, with the recent focus
being on refining the design. We are currently investigating per-CPU
completion queues and threads in order to reduce locks and increase
concurrency. Also reviewing the BSD/OS CAM lockdown to see what ideas
can be shared. Work should hopefully puck back up in late July.
Development is taking place in the FreeBSD Perforce repository under the
//depot/projects/scottl-camlock/... branch for now.

cp(4) driver for Cronyx Tau-PCI was added. Cronyx Tau-PCI is family of
synchronous WAN adapters with various set of interfaces such as V.35,
RS-232, RS-530(449), X.21, E1, E3, T3, STS-1. This is a third family of
Cronyx adapters that is supported by FreeBSD now. Now all three drivers
cx(4), ctau(4) and cp(4) are on both major branches (HEAD and RELENG_4).

Busdma conversion was recently finished. Current work is concentrated on
locking both for adapters drivers and for sppp (see my other report for
additional information).

FreeBSD ports monitoring system

  FreeBSD ports monitoring system   URL: http://portsmon.firepipe.net/index.html
  --------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------

Contact: Mark Linimon <linimon_at_lonesome_dot_com>

The system continues to function well. The accuracy of the automatic
classification algorithm has been improved by assigning a higher
priority to port names found in pieces of Makefiles.

Several bugs had to be fixed due to the transition from bento to
pointyhat. For about two weeks the URLs to the build errors were wrong.
This has now been corrected (but note that some of the pointyhat summary
pages themselves still show the broken links.)

A report was added to show only PRs in the 'feedback' state, so that
committers can focus on maintainer and/or responsible timeouts. (As a
reminder, the policy is 2 weeks). Another report on 'ports that are in
ports/MOVED, but still exist' has also been added to the Anomalies page.
Sometimes these are actual errors but not always.

Here are my latest observations about the trends in ports PRs:

-   We were (very briefly) down to 650 ports PRs. From looking at the
    graphs, this appears to be the lowest number since 2001. This is
    despite the fact that between the two time periods the number of
    ports had increased 70%.
-   We have made a little bit of progress on the number of PRs which
    apply to existing ports and have been assigned to a FreeBSD
    committer, from 400 to around 350. This is partly due to some
    committers going through the database, putting old PRs into the
    'feedback' state, and then later invoking the 'maintainer timeout'
    rule mentioned above. (In some cases the PRs are now too old to
    still apply, and those are just closed.)
-   A few maintainers are currently responsible for one-third of
    those 350. Please, if you feel that you are over committed, consider
    asking for new volunteers to maintain these ports.
-   In terms of build errors, there is some new breakage from the
    preliminary testing with gcc3.4, which is even stricter with respect
    to the code it will accept than was gcc3.3. Many of these errors are
    shown as 'unknown' by the classification script. I have submitted a
    patch to fix this.
-   The majority of the build errors are still due to compilation
    problems, primarily from the gcc upgrades. Since FreeBSD tends to be
    at the forefront of gcc adaptation, this is to be expected, but IMHO
    we should really try to fix as many of these as possible before 5.3
    is released.
-   The next highest number of build errors are caused by code that does
    not build on our 64-bit architectures due to the assumption that
    "all the world's a PC". Here is the entire list; the individual bars
    are clickable.

FreeBSD profile.sh is an enhancement to the FreeBSD 5 rcng boot system,
targeted at laptops. One can configure multiple network environments
(eg, home, work, university). After this initial configuration, the
laptop detects automatically in what environment it is started and
configures itself accordingly. Not only network settings, but almost
everything from under /etc can be configured per environment. It is also
possible to suspend the machine in one environment and wake it up in a
different one, and reconfiguration will happen automatically.

  ------------ ----------------------------------------------------------

Contact: Juli Mallett <jmallett@FreeBSD.org>

In the past two months, opportunities to perform a good chunk of work on
FreeBSD/MIPS have arisen and significant issues with context switching,
clocks, interrupts, and kernel virtual memory have been resolved. A
number of issues with caches were fixed, however those are far from
complete and at last check, there were issues when running cached which
would prevent booting sometimes. Due to toolchain issues in progress,
current kernels are no longer bootable on real hardware.

A 64-bit MIPS emulator has arisen giving the ability to test and debug
in an emulator, and much testing has taken place in it. It has been
added to the FreeBSD ports tree, and the port will be actively tracking
the main codebase as possible. In general, FreeBSD/MIPS kernels should
run fine in it.

Before toolchain and cache issues, the first kernel threads would run,
busses and some devices would attach, and the system would boot to a
mountroot prompt.

i386 Interrupt Code & PCI Interrupt Routing

Contact: John Baldwin <jhb@FreeBSD.org>

Support for programming the polarity and trigger mode of interrupt
sources at runtime was added. This includes a mini-driver for the ELCR
register used to control the configuration for ISA and EISA interrupts.
The atpic driver reprograms the ELCR as necessary, while the apic driver
reprograms the interrupt pin associated with an interrupt source as
necessary. The information about which configuration to use mostly comes
from ACPI. However, non-ACPI systems also force any ISA interrupts used
to route PCI interrupts to use active-low polarity and level trigger.

Support for suspend and resume on i386 was also slightly improved.
Suspend and resume support was added to the ELCR, $PIR, and apic
drivers.

The ACPI PCI-PCI bridge driver was fixed to fall back to the PCI-PCI
bridge swizzle method for routing interrupts when a routing table was
not provided by the BIOS.

Mixed mode can now be disabled or enabled at boot time via a loader
tunable.

Improved Multibyte/Wide Character Support

Contact: Tim Robbins <tjr@FreeBSD.org>

Many more text-processing utilities in the FreeBSD base system have been
updated to work with multibyte characters, including comm, cut, expand,
fold, join, paste, unexpand, and uniq. New versions of GNU grep and GNU
sort (from coreutils) have been imported, together with multibyte
support patches from developers at IBM and Red Hat.

Future work will focus on modifying the regular expression functions to
work with multibyte characters, improving performance of the C library
routines, and updating the remaining utilities (sed and tr are two
important ones still remaining).

Network interface naming changes

An enhanced network interface cloning API has been committed. It allows
interfaces to support more complex names then the current name# style.
This functionality has been used to enable interesting cloners like
auto-configuring vlan interfaces. Other features include locking of
cloner structures and the ability of drivers to reject destroy requests.

Work on userland support for this functionality is ongoing.

Network Stack Locking

  Netperf Web Page   URL: http://www.watson.org/~robert/freebsd/netperf/
  ------------------ -----------------------------------------------------

Contact: Robert Watson <rwatson@FreeBSD.org>

This project is aimed at converting the FreeBSD network stack from
running under the single Giant kernel lock to permitting it to run in a
fully parallel manner on multiple CPUs (i.e., a fully threaded network
stack). This will improve performance/latency through reentrancy and
preemption on single-processor machines, and also on multi-processor
machines by permitting real parallelism in the processing of network
traffic. As of FreeBSD 5.2, it was possible to run low level network
functions, as well as the IP filtering and forwarding plane, without the
Giant lock, as well as "process to completion" in the interrupt handler.
This permitted both inbound and outbound traffic to run in parallel
across multiple interfaces and CPUs.

Work continues to improve the maturity and completeness of the locking
(and performance) of the network stack for 5.3. The network stack
development branch has been updated to the latest CVS HEAD, as well as
the following and more. Many but not all of these changes have been
merged to the FreeBSD CVS tree as of the writing of this report.
Complete details and more minor changes are documented in the README
file on the netperf web page.

-   Addition of hard-coded WITNESS lock orders for socket-related locks,
    route locks, interface locks, file descriptor locks, SLIP, and PCB
    locks for various protocols (UDP, TCP, UNIX domain sockets).
    (Merged)
-   Modified MAC Framework to use inpcbs as the source for mbuf labels
    rather than reaching up to the socket layer, avoiding the additional
    acquisition of socket locks. Locked access to so_label and
    so_peerlabel using the socket lock throughout; assert socket lock in
    the MAC Framework where depended on. MAC Framework now makes a copy
    of the socket label before externalizing to prevent a copyout while
    holding the label lock (and potentially seeing an inconsistent
    label). (Merged)
-   Extensive annotation of locking state throughout the network stack,
    especially relating to sockets.
-   Several locking fixes for ng_base.c, the basic Netgraph
    infrastructure. (Merged)
-   Global accept filter list locking, especially during registration.
    (Partially merged)
-   Revise locking in socket state transition helpers, such as
    soisconnecting(), soisconnected(), etc, to simplify lock handling.
    (Merged)
-   Fix bugs in netatalk DDP locking, merge all netatalk locking to CVS.
    (Merged)
-   soref() socket locking assertions and associated fixes. (Merged)
-   Fifofs now uses its own mutex instead of the vnode interlock to
    synchronize fifo operations, avoiding lock order issues with socket
    buffer locking. (Merged)
-   Cleanup of locking related to file descriptor close and Giant
    requirements. Experimentation with reducing locking here.
-   Review and fix several instances of socket locking in the TCP code.
    (Merged)
-   NFS server locking merged to FreeBSD CVS. (Merged)
-   Accept locking merged to rwatson_netperf, and to FreeBSD CVS. A new
    global mutex, accept_mtx, now protects all socket related accept
    queue and state fields (SS_COMP, SS_INCOMP), and flags relating to
    accept are moved from the generic so_state field to so_qstate.
    accept1() rearranged, as with sonewconn() as a result, and a file
    descriptor leak fixed. Close a variety of races in socket
    referencing during accept. soabort() and other partially connected
    socket related functions updated to take locking into account.
    (Merged)
-   Issue associated with non-atomic setting of SS_NBIO in fifofs
    resolved by adding MSG_NBIO. (Merged)
-   Several flags from so_state moved to sb_state so they can be locked
    properly using the socket buffer mutex. (Merged)
-   Socket locks are now not held over calls into the protocol
    preventing many lock order issues between socket and protocol locks,
    and avoiding a substantial amount of conditional locking. (Merged)
-   mbuma, the UMA-based mbuf allocator, is merged to CVS. This reduces
    the kernel to one widely used memory allocator, improves
    performance, and allows memory from mbufs to be reclaimed and reused
    for other types of storage when pressure lowers. (Merged)
-   sb_flags now properly locked. (Merged)
-   Global MAC label ifnet lock introduced to protect labels on network
    interfaces. (Merged)
-   Rewrites of parts of soreceive() and sosend() to improve MP safety
    merged to CVS, including modifications to make sure socket buffer
    cache state is consistent when locks are released.
    sockbuf_pushsync() added to guarantee consistency of cached
    pointers. (Merged)
-   UNIX domain socket locking revised to use a subsystem lock due to
    inconsistencies in lock order and inconsistent coverage ofunpcb
    fields. Cleanup of global variable locking in UNIX domain sockets,
    Giant handling when entering VFS. All UNIX domain socket locking
    merged to CVS. (Merged)
-   netisr dispatch introduced in the routing code such that routing
    socket message delivery is performed asynchronously from routing
    events to avoid lock order issues. (Merged)
-   IGMP and multicast locking merged to CVS. (Merged)
-   Cleanup of lasting recursive Giant acquisition left over from
    forwarding/bridging plane only locking. (Merged)
-   ALTQ imported into the FreeBSD in a locked state. (Merged)
-   Conditional locking in sbdrop(), sbdroprecord(), sbrelease(),
    sbflush(), spappend(), sbappendstream(), sbappendrecord(),
    sbinsertoob(), sbappendaddr(), sbappendcontrol() eliminated.
    (Merged)
-   Some cleanup of IP stack management ioctls and lock order issues.
    (Merged)
-   Cleanup and annotation of sorflush() use of a temporary stack held
    socket buffer during flush. (Merged)
-   Substantial cleanup of socket wakeup mechanisms to drop locks in
    advance of wakeup, avoid holding locks over upcalls, and assertions
    of proper lock state. (Merged)
-   With the integration of revised ifnet cloning, cloning data
    structures are now better locked. (Merged)
-   Socket locking for portalfs. (Merged)
-   Global so_global_mtx introduced to protect generation numbers and
    socket counts. (Merged)
-   KAME IPSEC and FAST_IPSEC now use rawcb_mtx to protect raw socket
    list integration. More work required here. (Merged)
-   Socket locking around SO_SNDLOWAT and SO_RCVLOWAT. (Merged)
-   soreserve() and sbreserve() reformulation to improve locking and
    consistency. Similar cleanup in the use of reservation functions in
    tcp_mss(). (Merged)
-   Locking cost reduction in sbappend*(). (Merged)
-   Global locking for a number of Netgraph modules, including ng_iface,
    ng_ppp, ng_socket, ng_pppoe, ng_frame_relay, ng_tty, ng_eiface.
    (Merged)
-   IPv6 inpcb locking. Resulting cleanup of inpcb locking assertions,
    and enabling of inpcb locking assertions by default even with IPv6
    compiled in.
-   if_xl now MPSAFE. (Merged)
-   soreceive() non-inline OOB support placed in its own function.
    (Merged)
-   NFS client socket locking. (Merged)
-   SLIP now uses a asynchronous task queue to prevent Giant-free
    entrance of the TTY code.
-   E-mail sent to current@ providing Giant-free operation guidelines
    and details.

Packet Filter - pf

  ------------------ ---------------------------------------
  Links              
  The pf homepage.   URL: http://www.benzedrine.cx/pf.html
  ------------------ ---------------------------------------

Contact: Max Laier <mlaier@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Daniel Hartmeier <dhartmei@FreeBSD.org>

We imported pf as of OpenBSD 3.5 stable on June, 17th which will be the
base for 5-STABLE pf (according to the current schedule). The most
important improvement in this release is the new interface handling
which makes it possible to write pf rule sets for hot-pluggable devices
and pseudo cloning devices, before they exist. The import of the ALTQ
framework enabled us to finally provide the related pf functions as
well.

Before 5-STABLE we will import some bug fixes from OpenBSD-current,
which have not been merged to their stable branch, as well as some
FreeBSD specific features. The planned ALTQ API make-over will also
affect pf.

We are (desperately) looking for non-manpage documentation for FreeBSD
pf and somebody to write it. Few things have changed so a port of the
excellent "PF FAQ" on the OpenBSD homepage should be fitting. There are,
however, a couple of points that need conversion. A simple tutorial how
to setup a NAT gateway with pf would also help. The in-kernel NAT engine
is very easy to use, we should tell people about this alternative. This
is even more true since the pf module now plugs into GENERIC without
modifications.

PowerPC Port

Contact: Peter Grehan <grehan@FreeBSD.org>

The port has been moving along steadily. There have been reports of
buildworld running natively. Works is almost complete on make release so
there will be bootable CD images in the near future.

Project Mini-Evil

Contact: Scott Long <scottl@freebsd.org>

Project Mini-Evil is an attempt to extend Bill Paul's 'Project Evil'
Windows NDIS wrapper layer to the SCSI MiniPort and StorePort layers.
While drivers exist for most storage controllers that are on the market
today, many companies are integrating software RAID into their products
but not providing any source code or design specs. Instead of constantly
reverse-engineering these raid layers and attempting to shoehorn them
into the ata-raid driver, Project Mini-Evil will run the Windows drivers
directly. It will hopefully also run most any SCSI/ATA/RAID drivers that
conform to the SCSI Miniport or Storeport specification.

Work on this project is split between making the NDIS wrapper code more
general and implementing the new APIs. Development is taking place in
the FreeBSD Perforce repository under the //depot/projects/sonofevil/...
branch.

SMPng Status Report

Contact: John Baldwin <jhb@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: <smp@FreeBSD.org>

Not a lot happened on the SMPng front outside of the work on locking the
network stack (which is a large amount of work). The priorities of the
various software interrupt threads were corrected and locking for
taskqueues was improved. The return value of the sema_timedwait()
function was adjusted to be more consistent with cv_timedwait(). A small
fix was made to the sleepqueue code to shorten the amount of time that a
sleepqueue chain lock is held when waking up threads. Some simple debug
code for profiling the hash tables used in the sleep queue and turnstile
code was added. This will allow developers to measure the impact of any
tweaks to the hash table sizes or the hash algorithm.

Sync protocols (Netgraph and SPPP)

  Current code, ideas, problems.   URL: http://www.freebsd.org/~rik

Contact: Roman Kurakin <rik@FreeBSD.org>

Currently I work on two directions: if_spppfr.c and sppp locking (on
behalf of netperf). At the moment of writing this sppp locking is not
ready yet. But it would be ready in couple of days. Also you may find as
a part of this work some user space fixes for rwatson netperf code (Only
that I was able to catch while world compilation. If you know some
others let me know and I'll try to fix them too).

Since sppp code is quite big and state machine is very complicated, it
would be difficult to test all code paths. I will glad to get any help
in testing all this stuff. More tester more probability to test all
possible cases.

Work on FRF.12 (ng_frf12) is frozen since of low interest and lack of
time. Current state of stable code: support of FRF.12 End-to-End
fragmentation. Support of FRF.12 Interface (UNI and NNI) fragmentation
is not tested.

TTY subsystem realignment

Contact: Poul-Henning Kamp <phk@FreeBSD.org>

An effort to get the tty subsystem out from under Giant has morphed into
an more general effort to eliminate a lot of code which have been
improperly copy & pasted into device drivers. In an ideal world, tty
drivers would never get near a cdevsw, but since some drivers are more
than just tty drivers (for instance sync) a more sensible compromise
must be reached. The work is ongoing.

Various GEOM classes and geom(8) utility

Contact: Pawel Jakub Dawidek <pjd@FreeBSD.org>

I'm working on various GEOM classes. Some of them are already committed
and ready for use (GATE, CONCAT, STRIPE, LABEL, NOP). The MIRROR class
is finished in 90% and will be committed in very near future. Next I
want to work on RAID3 and RAID5 implementations. Userland utility to
control GEOM classes (geom(8)) is already in the tree.

Contact: Tom Rhodes <trhodes@FreeBSD.org>

The portaudit utility is currently an add-on to FreeBSD designed to give
administrators and users a heads up with regards to security
vulnerabilities in third party software. The VuXML database keeps a
record of these security vulnerabilities along with internal security
holes. When installed, the portaudit utility periodically downloads a
database with known issues and checks all installed ports or packages
against it; should it find vulnerable software installed the
administrator or user is notified during the daily run output of the
periodic scripts.

These utilities are considered to be of production quality and
discussion is taking place over whether or not they should be included
as part of the base system. All ports committers are urged to add
entries when when a vulnerability is discovered; any questions may be
sent to eik@ or myself.
