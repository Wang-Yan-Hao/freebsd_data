Introduction

This report covers FreeBSD related projects between January and March
2007. This quarter ended with a big bang as a port of Sun's critically
acclaimed ZFS was added to the tree and thus will be available in the
upcoming FreeBSD 7.0 release. Earlier this year exciting benchmark
results showed the fruits of our SMP work. Read more on the details in
the "SMP Scalability" report.

During the summer, FreeBSD will once again take part in Google's Summer
of Code initiative. Student selection is underway and we are looking
forward to a couple of exciting projects to come.

BSDCan is approaching rapidly, and will be held May 16-19th in Ottawa.

Thanks to all the reporters for the excellent work! We hope you enjoy
reading.

Over the past few months there has been a substantially increased focus
on improving scalability of FreeBSD on large SMP hardware. This has been
driven in part by the new availability of 8-core hardware to the
project, which allows easy profiling of scalability bottlenecks and
benchmarking of proposed changes. Significant progress has been made on
certain application workloads such as MySQL and PostgreSQL, with the
result that FreeBSD 7 now has excellent scaling to at least 8-CPU
systems with prospects for further improvements. Progress with other
application workloads has been limited by the need to set up a suitable
test case; please contact me if you are interested in helping. As part
of this general effort, work is progressing steadily on removing the
last remaining Giant-locked code from the kernel. A complete list of
remaining Giant-locked code is found here:
http://wiki.freebsd.org/SMPTODO Many of these sub-tasks have owners, but
some do not. The major remaining Giant-locked subsystem with no owner is
the TTY subsystem. In parallel, profiling of contention and bottlenecks
in other subsystems has lead to a number of experimental changes which
are being developed. Work is in progress by Jeff Roberson and Attilio
Rao to break up the global scheduler spinlock in favor of a set of
per-CPU scheduling locks, which is expected to improve performance on
systems with many CPUs. Experimental changes by Robert Watson to allow
for multiple netisr threads show good promise for improving loopback IP
performance on large SMP systems, which can otherwise easily saturate a
single netisr thread. A variety of other changes are being profiled and
evaluated to improve SMP performance under various workloads. The
majority of these changes are collected in the
//depot/user/kris/contention/ Perforce branch.

During the last three months not too much has changed. Here is a quick
list of changes:

1.  There has been some cleanups in the UCOM layer, generally to to
    create a context for all the callbacks so that they can call
    sleeping functions. This is achieved using the USB config thread
    system. The reason for this is that the code becomes simpler when
    synchronous operation is applied versus asynchronous. But
    asynchronous behavior is the most secure, hence then all USB
    resources are preallocated for each transfer. After the change, only
    data transfers are done asynchronously. All configuration is now
    done synchronously. This makes the USB device drivers look more like
    in the old USB stack.
2.  moscom.c has been imported from OpenBSD. It is called umoscom.c
    under FreeBSD.
3.  ugensa.c has been imported from NetBSD.
4.  f_axe.c has now has support for Ax88178 and Ax88772, which is
    derived from OpenBSD.

In my last status report I asked for access to Sparc64 boxes with
FreeBSD installed. Testing is ongoing and some problems remain with EHCI
PCI Cards. I am not exactly sure where the problem is, but it appears
that DMA-able memory does not get synced properly.

Markus Brueffer is still working on the USB HID parser and support.
Nothing has been committed yet.

Several people have reported success with my new USB stack. Some claim
2x improvements, others have seen more. But don't expect too much.

If you want to test the new USB stack, checkout the USB perforce tree or
download the SVN version of the USB driver from my USB homepage. At the
moment the tarballs are a little out of date.

Ideas and comments with regard to the new USB API are welcome at
freebsd-usb@freebsd.org .

In the time since the last status report, one security advisory has been
issued concerning a problem in the base system of FreeBSD; this problem
was in "contributed" code maintained outside of FreeBSD. In addition,
several Errata Notices have been issued in collaboration with the
release engineering team, including one concerning FreeBSD Update. The
Vulnerabilities and Exposures Markup Language (VuXML) document has
continued to be updated by the Security Team and Ports Committers
documenting new vulnerabilities in the FreeBSD Ports Collection; since
the last status report, 21 new entries have been added, bringing the
total up to 890.

The following FreeBSD releases are supported by the FreeBSD Security
Team: FreeBSD 5.5, FreeBSD 6.1, and FreeBSD 6.2. Of particular note,
FreeBSD 4.11 and FreeBSD 6.0 are no longer supported. The respective End
of Life dates of supported releases are listed on the web site.

We have added Remko Lodder to the bugmeister team. Remko has been doing
a great deal of work to go through antique PRs, especially in the i386
category, and it was time to recognize that hard work. As a result of
his work the i386 count is at a multi-year low.

Remko has also been instrumental in working with some new volunteers who
are interested in finding out how they can contribute. Our current plans
are to ask them to look through the PR backlog and, firstly, ask for
feedback from the submitters, and secondly, identify PRs that need
action by committers. We also have some committers who have volunteered
to review those PRs. If you are interested in helping, please subscribe
to bugbusters@FreeBSD.org. Our thanks to our current helpers, including
Harrison Grundy.

The overall PR count has dropped to around 5100, a significant
reduction.

During the past quarter, the Release Engineering team has begun planning
and preparing for FreeBSD 7.0, which is scheduled for release later in
2007. The HEAD codeline has been placed in a "slush" mode, meaning that
large changes should be coordinated with the Release Engineering team
before being committed.

The RE team also produced snapshots of FreeBSD 6.2-STABLE and
7.0-CURRENT for February and March 2007, corresponding roughly to the
state of those development branches at the start of the respective
months. While they have not had the benefit of extensive testing, and
should not be used in production, they can be useful for experimenting
with or testing new features.

The FreeBSD Foundation ended Q1 raising over $65,000. We're a quarter of
the way to our goal of raising $250,000 this year. We continued our
mission of supporting developer communication by helping FreeBSD
developers attend AsiaBSDCon. We are a sponsor of BSDCan and are
currently accepting travel grant applications for this conference.

The foundation provided support that helped the ZFS file system
development. We continued working to upgrade the project's network
testbed with 10Gigabit interconnects. We attended SCALE where we
received an offer from No Starch Press to include a foundation ad in
their BSD books. Our first ad will appear in the book "Designing BSD
Rootkits."

Kernel

Building Linux Device Drivers on FreeBSD

  ------- -----------------------------------------------------------------
  Links   
          URL: http://info.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/FreeBSD/linux_bsd_kld.html
  ------- -----------------------------------------------------------------

Contact: Luigi Rizzo <rizzo@icir.org>

The above URL documents some work done around January to build an
emulation layer for the Linux kernel API that would allow Linux device
driver to be built on FreeBSD with as little as possible modifications.
Initially the project focused on USB webcams, a category of devices for
which there was basically no support so far. The emulation layer,
available as a port ( devel/linux-kmod-compat ) simulates enough of the
Linux USB stack to let us build, from unmodified Linux sources, two
webcam drivers, also available as ports ( multimedia/linux-gspca-kmod
and multimedia/linux-ov511-kmod ), with the former supporting over 200
different cameras.

While some of the functions map one-to-one, for others it was necessary
to build a full emulation (e.g. collecting input from various function
calls, and then mapping sets of Linux data structures into functionally
equivalent sets of FreeBSD data structures). But overall, this project
shows that the software interfaces are reasonably orthogonal to each
other so one does not need to implement the full Linux kernel API to get
something working. More work is necessary to cover other aspects of the
Linux kernel API, e.g. memory mapping, PCI bus access, and the network
stack API, so we can extend support to other families of peripherals.

Open tasks:

1.  Implement more subsystems (e.g. the network interface API; the
    memory management/pci bus access API).
2.  Address licensing issues. In the current port, the C code is
    entirely new and under a FreeBSD license. Many of the headers have
    been rewritten (and documented) from scratch (and so under a FreeBSD
    license as well). Some of the other headers are still taken from
    various Linux distributions and need to be rewritten to generate
    BSD-licensed code that can be imported in the kernel instead of
    being made available as a port. While this is not a concern with GNU
    drivers, it may be an important feature for drivers that are
    available under a dual license.

Since the last status report AMD64 was feature synced with i386. Notably
TLS and futexes are now available on AMD64. Many thanks to Jung-Uk Kim
for doing the TLS work.

Currently the focus is to implement the *at() family of linux syscalls
and to find and fix the remaining futex problems.

We need some more testers and bug reporters. So if you have a little bit
of time and a favorite linux application, please play around with it on
-CURRENT. If there is a problem, have a look at the Wiki if we already
know about it and report on emulation@. We are specially interested in
reports about the 2.6 compatibility (sysctl
compat.linux.osversion=2.6.16), but only with the most recent -current
and maybe with some patches we have in the perforce repository
(available from the wiki).

We would like to thank all the people which tested the changes /
submitted patches and thus helped improve the linux compatibility
environment.

Contact: Andrew Thompson <thompsa@FreeBSD.org>

Work has completed to port over trunk(4) from OpenBSD and this also
includes merging 802.3ad LACP from agr(4) in NetBSD. This driver allows
aggregation of multiple network interfaces as one virtual interface
using a number of different protocols/algorithms.

-   failover - Sends traffic through the secondary port if the master
    becomes inactive.
-   fec - Supports Cisco Fast EtherChannel.
-   lacp - Supports the IEEE 802.3ad Link Aggregation Control Protocol
    (LACP) and the Marker Protocol.
-   loadbalance - Static loadbalancing using an outgoing hash.
-   roundrobin - Distributes outgoing traffic using a round-robin
    scheduler through all active ports.

This will be committed shortly, further testing is welcome.

Work is slowly continuing on this driver, focusing mainly on dealing
with the newly released firmware for the card. The old firmware was not
redistributable, the new firmware can be redistributed but has a
completely different API. With the new firmware changes almost complete,
the driver is approaching a state ready for -CURRENT.

Open tasks:

1.  Fix mbuf leakage (potential fix pending).
2.  Integrate s/w control of radio transmitter.

Stable release 4.1 of mpd4 branch was released in February providing
many new features and fixes. Mpd3 branch was declared legacy.

Since the release several new features have been implemented in CVS:

-   Link repeater functionality (aka L2TP/PPTP Access Concentrator),
-   Per-interface traffic filtering using ng_bpf,
-   Very fast traffic shaping/rate-limiting using ng_car.

ng_car node has been updated, to support shaping and very fast
Cisco-like rate-limiting. ng_ppp node has been completely re-factored to
confirm to the protocol stack model.

Open tasks:

1.  LAC/PAC testing.
2.  Traffic filtering/shaping/rate-limiting testing.
3.  PPTP modification for multiple bindings support.
4.  Dynamic link/bundle creation.

GCC 4.1 integration

Contact: Alexander Kabaev <kan@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Kris Kennaway <kris@FreeBSD.org>

A version of GCC 4.1 is being prepared for inclusion into FreeBSD
7.0-CURRENT. Work was started late in 2006 but progress on certain
technical points (e.g. correctly integrating and bootstrapping a shared
libgcc_s into the build) was slow due to lack of developer time. The
remaining outstanding issue is that compiling with -O2 is shown to lead
to runtime failures of certain binaries (e.g. some port builds); it is
not currently known whether these are due to application errors or GCC
miscompilations. It is believed that the current snapshot is otherwise
ready for inclusion, and this will likely happen within a week or two.

The ports count is nearing 17,000. The PR count has been stable at
around 700. The 'new port' PR backlog is at a multi-year low. We
appreciate all the hard work of our ports committers.

Since the long 6.2 release cycle ended, portmgr has once again been able
to do experimental ports runs. As a result of six run/commit cycles, the
portmgr PR count is now the lowest in quite some time. Please see the
CHANGES and UPDATING files for details. Many thanks to Pav among others
for keeping the build cluster busy.

We have received new hardware, resulting in a significant speedup of our
package building capability: the AMD64 package builds now use 4 8-core
machines (and one lonely UP system), which means a full AMD64 build is
about 5 times faster than it was. Also, the i386 cluster gained an
8-core and roughly doubled its performance too. Two of the sparc64 build
machines have recently brought back online, so package builds there have
been restarted there after a long period offline.

linimon continues to work on improvements to portsmon to allow graphing
of the dependent ports of ignored/failed ports. This work will be
presented at BSDCan. In addition, pages that show the state of port
uploads on ftp*.FreeBSD.org have been added, as well as ports that have
NO_PACKAGE set. Also, the individual port overview page now shows the
latest package that has been uploaded to the ftp servers for each
buildenv.

A number of absent maintainers have been replaced by some new volunteers
who had been sending PRs to update and/or fix their ports. Welcome! This
helps to spread the workload.

Since the last report, support for FreeBSD 4.X has been dropped from the
Ports Collection. Anyone still using RELENG_4 should have stayed with
the ports infrastructure as of the RELEASE_4_EOL tag, as later commits
remove that support. 4.X served us long and well but the burden of
trying to support 4 major branches finally became too much to ask of our
volunteers. Use of 4.X, even with the RELEASE_4_EOL tag, is no longer
recommended; we recommend either 6.2-RELEASE or RELENG_6, depending on
your needs.

There have been new releases of the ports tinderbox code, the portmaster
update utility, and portupgrade. A new utility, pkgupgrade, has been
introduced by Michel Talon, which appears interesting.

KDE was updated to 3.5.6.

GNOME was updated to 2.18.

XFree86 version 3 was removed as being years out of date.

We have added 3 new committers since the last report.

Open tasks:

1.  Most of the remaining ports PRs are "existing port/PR assigned to
    committer". Although the maintainer-timeout policy is helping to
    keep the backlog down, we are going to need to do more to get the
    ports in the shape they really need to be in.
2.  Although we have added many maintainers, we still have many
    unmaintained ports. The number of buildable packages on AMD64 lags
    behind a bit; sparc64 requires even more work.

X.Org 7.2 integration

X.Org 7.2 is now on final approach for landing into the ports tree. Work
had proceeded at a slow pace for the first few months of the year due to
reduced availability of flz@, the single developer working on
integration. Recently lesi@ was recruited back into the task and
readiness of the ports collection was pushed to completion (i.e. there
are no major regressions apparent on package builds). The remaining
tasks which need to be completed are a review of the diff to make sure
no unintentional changes or regressions slip in to the CVS tree in the
big merge, and completion of an upgrade script to manage the migration
from X.Org 6.9 (X.Org 7.2 is so fundamentally different that it cannot
be upgraded "automatically" using the existing tools like portupgrade).
We hope to have these finished within a week or two, at which stage the
ports collection will be frozen for the integration, and we will likely
remain in a ``mini-freeze'' for a week or two in order to focus
committer attention on resolving the inevitable undetected problems
which will emerge from this major change.

The sixth EuroBSDCon will take place at Symbion in Copenhagen, Denmark
on Friday the 14th and Saturday 15th of September 2007.

The estimated price for the two day conference is 200EUR, excluding
Legoland trip and social event. The whole-day trip to Legoland is
expected to cost around 130EUR including transportation, some food on
the way, and entry fee. Arrangements have been made with a newly
renovated Hostel which offers beds for 23EUR per night and 10EUR
breakfast. A lounge with sponsored Internet connection will be available
at the Hostel. Staying at the hostel is of course entirely optional and
several Hotels exists in the area. Reservation for the conference and
exact prices are expected to be ready no later than 1st of May.

As of this writing 10 presentations have been accepted and more are in
the process of being evaluated.

For FreeBSD Developers, a by invitation Developers summit will be held
in connection with the conference. Exactly when this will take place has
not yet been decided.

We are still looking for more sponsors.

A public IRC channel #eurobsdcon on EFnet has been created for
discussion and questions about the conference.

More details will follow on the EuroBSDCon 2007 web site as they become
available.
