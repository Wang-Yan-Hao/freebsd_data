Introduction:

The FreeBSD Bi-monthly status reports are back! In this edition, we
catch up on seven highly productive months and look forward to the end
of 2003.

As always, the FreeBSD development crew has been hard at work. Support
for the AMD64 platform quickly sprang up and is nearly complete. KSE has
improved greatly since the 5.1 release and will soon become the default
threading package in FreeBSD. Many other projects are in the works to
improve performance, enhance the user experience, and expand FreeBSD
into new areas. Take a look below at the impressive summary of work!

Contact: Maksim Yevmenkin <m_evmenkin@yahoo.com>

I'm very pleased to announce that another release is available for
download at
http://www.geocities.com/m_evmenkin/ngbt-fbsd-20030908.tar.gz. I have
also prepared patch for the FreeBSD source tree. The patch was submitted
for review to the committers.

Fixed few bugs in kernel modules. The ng_hci(4) and ng_l2cap(4) modules
were changed to fix issue with Netgraph timeouts. The ng_ubt(4) module
was changed to fix compilation issue on -current.

Improved user-space utilities. Implemented new libsdp(3). Added new
sdpcontrol(8) utility. The rfcomm_sppd(1), rfcomm_pppd(8) and obexapp(1)
were changed and now can obtain RFCOMM channel via SDP from the server.
The hccontorol(8) utility now has four new commands. The hcsecd(8)
daemon now saves link keys on the disk.

I've been recently contacted by few individuals who whould like to port
current FreeBSD Bluetooth code to other BSD systems (OpenBSD and
NetBSD). The work is slowly progressing towards un-Netgraph'ing current
code. In the mean time Netgraph version will be the primary supported
version of the code.

ACPI Status Report

  ------- -----------------------------------------

Contact: Nate Lawson <njl@FreeBSD.org>

Work is continuing on updating ACPI with new features as well as
bugfixing. A new embedded controller driver was written in July with
support for the ACPI 2.0 ECDT as well as more robust polling support.
Also, a buffer overflow in the ACPICA resource list handling that caused
panics for some users was fixed. Marcel helped get acpidump(8) tested
and basically working on ia64.

Upcoming work includes integrating ACPI notifies with devd(8),
committing user-submitted drivers for ASUS and Toshiba hotkeys, Cx
processor sleep states (so my laptop doesn't burn my lap), and power
resource support for intelligently powering down unused or idle devices.

Users who have problems with ACPI are encouraged to submit a PR and
email its number to acpi-jp@jp.FreeBSD.org. Bug reports of panics or
crashes have first priority and non-working features or missing devices
(except suspend/resume problems) second. Reports of failed
suspend/resume should NOT be submitted as PRs at this time due to most
of them being a result of incomplete device support that is being
addressed. However, feel free to mail them to the list as any
information is helpful.

AMD64 Porting

Contact: Peter Wemm <peter@FreeBSD.org>

The last known bug that prevented AMD64 machines completing a full
release has been fixed - one single character error that caused
ghostscript to crash during rendering diagrams. SMP work is nearing
completion and should be committed within the next few days. The SMP
code uses the ACPI MADT table based on John Baldwin's work-in-progress
there for i386. We need to spend some time on low level optimization
because there are several suboptimal places that have been ignored for
simplicity, context switching in particular. MTRR support has been
committed and XFree86 can use it. cvsup now works but the ezm3 port has
not been updated yet. The default data segment size limit is 8GB instead
of 512M, and the (primitive) i386 binary emulation support knows how to
lower the rlimits for executing 32 bit binaries.

Notable things missing still: Hardware debug register support needs to
be written; gdb is still being done as an external set of patches
relative to the not-yet-released FSF gdb tree; DDB does not disassemble
properly; DDB cannot do stack traces without -fno-omit-frame-pointer - a
stack unwinder is needed; i386 and amd64 linux binary emulation is
needed, and the i386 FreeBSD binary emulation still needs work -
removing the stackgap code in particular.

The platform in general is very reliable although a couple of problems
have been reported over the last week. One appears to be a stuck
interrupt, but all that code has been redone for SMP support.

ATAPI/CAM Status Report

Contact: Thomas Quinot <thomas@FreeBSD.org>

With the introduction of ATAng, some users of ATAPI/CAM have experienced
various problems. These have been mostly tracked down to issues in the
new ATA code, as well as two long-standing problems in portions of the
CAM layer that are rarely exercised with "real" SCSI SIMs. This has also
been an occasion to cleanup ATAPI/CAM to make it more robust, and to
enable DMA for devices accessed through it, resulting in improved
performances.

Binary security updates for FreeBSD

  ------- -------------------------------------------------

Contact: Colin Percival <cperciva@daemonology.net>

FreeBSD Update is a system for tracking the FreeBSD release (security)
branches. In addition to being faster and more convenient than source
updates, FreeBSD Update also requires less bandwidth and is more secure
than source updates via CVSup. However, FreeBSD Update is limited; it
can only update files which were installed from an official RELEASE
image and not recompiled locally. Right now I'm publishing binary
updates for 4.7-RELEASE and 4.8-RELEASE; since my only available box
takes 3.5 hours to buildworld, I don't have enough resources to do any
more than that.

In the near future, I'd like to: Find someone who is willing to donate a
faster buildbox; start building updates for other releases (at a
minimum, for all "supported" FreeBSD releases); add warnings if a file
would have been updated but can't be updated because it was recompiled
locally; add code to compare the local system against a list of "valid"
MD5 hashes for intrusion detection purposes; and add support for
cross-signing, whereby several machines could build updates
independently to protect against buildbox compromise.

The FreeBSD Java community has started an effort to improve the current
framework for Java-based ports. The main objective is the automation of
JDK/JRE build and run dependency checking.

The original version was aimed to ease the life of porters. Although it
has proved to be useful and reliable to a great extend, we are currently
working on a new version. We intend to reach a high degree of
flexibility to cope with the recent increase of available JDK/JRE
flavors. Furthermore, the new version will be easier to maintain, which
means improved reliability, and hopefully more frequent updates.

Compile FreeBSD with Intels C compiler (icc)

  --------------- ----------------------------------------
  Links           
  Some patches.   URL: http://www.Leidinger.net/FreeBSD/
  --------------- ----------------------------------------

Contact: Alexander Leidinger <netchild@FreeBSD.org>

Since I ported icc to FreeBSD I wanted to build FreeBSD with icc. Now
with icc 7.1 (and some patches) it is possible. There are still some
bugs, e.g. NFS doesn't work with an icc compiled kernel, IP seems to be
fragile, and some advanced optimizations trigger an ICE (Intel is
working on it). At the moment I'm waiting for our admins to install icc
on the FreeBSD cluster (we got a commercial license from Intel, so we
are allowed to distribute binaries which are compiled with icc), after
that I will try to convince some people with more knowledge of the IP
and NFS parts of the kernel to debug the remaining problems. When the
icc compiled kernel seems to work mostly bugfree the userland will get
the porting focus. Interested people may try to do a build of the ports
tree with icc independently from the status of the porting of the
userland... if this happens at the FreeBSD cluster, we would also be
allowed to distribute the binaries.

Benefits include: another set of compiler errors (debugging help), more
portable source, and code which is better optimized for a P4 (gcc has
some drawbacks in this area)

Cryptographic Support

Contact: Sam Leffler <sam@FreeBSD.org>

Support for several new crypto devices was added. The SafeNet 1141 is a
medium performance part that is not yet available on retail products.
The Hifn 7955 and 7956 parts are starting to appear on retail products
that should be available by the end of the year. Both devices support
AES encryption. Support for public key operations for the SafeNet
devices was recently done for OpenBSD and will be backported. Public key
support for the Hifn parts is planned.

A paper about the performance work done on the cryptographic subsystem
was presented at the Usenix BSDCon 2003 conference and received the best
paper award.

NetBSD recently imported the cryptographic subsystem.

Device_t locking

Contact: Warner Losh <imp@FreeBSD.org>

A number of races have been identified in locking device_t. Most of the
races have been identified in making device_t have to do with how
drivers are written. Efforts are underway to identify all the races, and
to contact the authors of subsystems that can help the drivers. Of
special concern is the need for the driver to ensure that all threads
are completely out of the driver code before detach() finishes. Of
additional concern is making sure that all sleepers are woken up before
certain routines are called so that other subsystems can ensure the last
condition and leave no dangling references. Locking device_t is
relatively straight forward apart from these issues. Towards the end of
proper locking, sample strawmen drivers are being used to work out what,
exactly proper is. Once these issues are all known and documented in the
code, efforts will be made to update relevant documentation in the tree.
There are many problems with driver locking that has been done to date,
but until we nail down how to write a driver in current, it will be
premature to contact specific driver writers with specific concerns.

Disk I/O

Contact: Poul-Henning Kamp <phk@FreeBSD.org>

The following items are in progress in the Disk I/O area: Turn scsi_cd.c
into a GEOM driver. (Patch out for review). Turn atapi-cd.c into a GEOM
driver. Turn fd.c into a GEOM driver. Move softupdates and snapshot
processing from SPECFS to UFS/FFS. Move userland access to device
drivers out of vnodes.

Once these preliminaries are dealt with, scatter/gather and
mapped/unmapped support will be added to struct bio/GEOM.

Dynamically Linked Root Support

Contact: Gordon Tetlow <gordon@FreeBSD.org>

Support for a dynamically linked /bin and /sbin has been committed,
although it is not turned on by default. Adventurous users can try it
out by building /bin and /sbin using the WITH_DYNAMICROOT make flag.
More testing is needed to determine if this is going to be default for
5.2-RELEASE. If anyone would like to benchmark worldstones with and
without dynamically linked /bin and /sbin, please feel free to do so and
submit the results.

The BSD Java Porting Team has recently reached an exciting milestone
with the release of the first "Diablo" JDK and JRE courtesy of the
FreeBSD Foundation. The release of Diablo Caffe and Diablo Latte 1.3.1
was the first binary release of a native FreeBSD JDK since 1.1.8 and
marks an important step forward in FreeBSD Java support.

The team is continuing development work, with a focus on achieving a
compliant JDK 1.4 release in the near future.

  --------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------

Contact: Mark Linimon <linimon_at_lonesome_dot_com>

Several months ago, I took it upon myself to to try present the
information contained on the bento build cluster to be presented in a
more user-friendly fashion; that is, to be browsed by error type, by
maintainer, and so forth. An early addition was code to attempt to
classify ports PRs by either "existing port" (after assiging the most
likely category and portname); "new port"; "framework" (e.g. bsd.port.mk
changes); and "unknown". Various columns about the ports PRs were added
to the reports.

The initial intent of this was to make life easier for ports
maintainers; however, the "general" reports are also useful to anyone
who just wants to, e.g., find out if a particular port is working on
their particular architecture and OS combination before downloading it.
Those with that general interest should start with the overview of one
port.

FreeBSD/ia64

Contact: Marcel Moolenaar <marcel@FreeBSD.org>

Much has happened since the last bi-monthly report, which was more than
half a year ago. FreeBSD 5.0 and FreeBSD 5.1 have been released for
example. With FreeBSD 5.2 approaching quickly, we're not going to look
back too far when it comes to our achievements. There's too much ahead
of us...

Two milestones have been reached after FreeBSD 5.1. The first is the
ability to support both Intel and HP machines with sources in CVS. This
due to a whole new driver for serial ports, or UARTs. Unfortunately this
still implies that syscons is not configured. That's another task for
another time, but keep an eye on KGI/FreeBSD... The second milestone is
the completion of KSE support. Both M:N and 1:1 threading is functional
on ia64 and the old libc_r library has been obsoleted. Testing has shown
that KSE (i.e. M:N) may well become the default threading model. It's
looking good.

The ABI hasn't changed after 5.1 and the expectation is that it won't
change much. This means that we can think about becoming a tier 1
platform. This also means we need gdb(1) support. Work on it has been
started but the road is bumpy and long. Kernel stability also has
improved significantly and we typically have one kernel panic remaining:
VM fault on no fault entry. This will be addressed with the long awaited
PMAP overhaul (see below).

Most work for FreeBSD 5.2 will be "sharpening the saw". Get those loose
ends tied. This is a slight change of plan made possible by a slip in
the release schedule. The 5.2 release is not going to be the start of
the -stable branch; it has been moved to 5.3. So, we use the extra time
to prepare the ground for 5.3.

The planned PMAP overhaul will probably be finished after 5.2. This
should address all known issues with SMP and fix those last panics. As a
side-effect, major performance improvements can be expected. More news
about this in the next status reports.

Contact: KDE-FreeBSD Mailinglist <kde@FreeBSD.org>

The FreeBSD ports were updated to KDE 3.1.4, another bug- and
security-fixes release. With this update, the QT port was updated to
version 3.2. Both will be included in FreeBSD 4.9. Significant work was
spent to fix KDE on FreeBSD-CURRENT after the removal of the gcc
-pthread Option. Automatic package builds from KDE CVS continued to
ensure and improve the quality of the upcoming KDE 3.2 release.

Future: Work is in progress to setup a new server for hosting the
KDE-FreeBSD Website, Repository and another KDE CVS mirror. With help
from Marcel Moolenaar the project will try to make KDE compile and
working on the Intel IA64. And last but not least efforts are being made
to fix the currently broken kdesu program.

implemented, implementation of a compatibility layer to compile Linux
fbdev drivers with more or less changes in the original driver
(experimental).

Except some memory allocation bugs, X (XGGI based on XFree 3.3.6) is now
working with the same driver as the console. A basic terminal has now to
be implemented.

Contact: Dan Eischen <deischen@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: David Xu <davidxu@FreeBSD.org>

KSE seems to be working well on x86, amd64, and ia64. The alpha userland
bits are done, but a couple of functions are unimplemented in the
kernel. For sparc64, the necessary functions are implemented in the
kernel, but the userland context switching functions need more
attention.

Since 5.1, efficient scope system threads (no upcalls when they block)
have been implemented, and KSE based pthread library can have both POSIX
scope process threads and scope system threads. It is also possible that
KSE based pthread library can implement pthread both in 1:1 and M:N
mode, I know Dan has such Makefile file patch for libkse not yet
committed.

KSE program now can work under ULE scheduler, its efficient should be
improved under the new scheduler in future. BSD scheduler is still the
best scheduler for current KSE implement.

Network Subsystem Locking and Performance

Contact: Sam Leffler <sam@FreeBSD.org>

The purpose of this project is to improve performance of the network
subsystem. A major part of this work is to complete the locking of the
networking subsystem so that it no longer depends on the "Giant lock"
for proper operation. Removing the use of Giant will improve performance
and permit multiple instances of the network stack to operate
concurrently on multiprocessor systems.

This project started in August. The emphasis has been on locking the
"lower half" of the networking code so that packet forwarding through
the IPv4 path can operate without the Giant lock as part of the 5.2
release. To this end locking was added to several network interface
drivers and much of the "middleware" code in the network was locked
(e.g. ipfw, dummynet, then routing table, multicast routing support,
etc). Work towards this goal is still ongoing but should be ready for
5.2. A variety of test systems have been running for several months
without the Giant lock in the network drivers and IP layer.

Past the 5.2 release Giant will be removed from the "upper half" of the
network subsystem and the socket layer. Once this is done the plan is to
measure and improve performance (though some work of this sort is always
happening). The ultimate goal is a system that performs at least as well
as 4.x for normal use on uniprocessor systems. On multiprocessor systems
we expect to see significantly better performance than 4.x due to
greater concurrency and reduced latency.

The project started this spring and released version 1.0 with a port
installation (security/pf) in may 2003. Version 2.0 is on the doorstep
as OpenBSD 3.4 will be released. Due to the porting efforts we were able
to reveal some bugs in the OpenBSD code and provided locking for the
PFIL_HOOKS, which we utilize. Tarball installation of a loadable kernel
module for testing can be found on the project homepage, a patchset is
in the making.

PF was started at OpenBSD as a substitute for ipfilter and provides the
same function set. However, in the two years it exists now, it has
gained many superior features that no other packet filter has. For a
impression take a look at the pf FAQ.

We hope to be eventually integrated into the base system. Before that we
have to resolve some issues with tcpdump and kame.

Release Engineering Status

Contact: Scott Long <re@FreeBSD.org>

The release of 4.9 is just around the corner and offers Physical Address
Extensions (PAE) for x86 along with the same world-class stability and
performance that is expected from the 4-STABLE series. As always, don't
forget to purchase a copy of the CD set from your favorite FreeBSD
vendor.

FreeBSD 5.1 was released in June and offered vastly improved stability
over 5.0 along with a working implementation of Kernel Scheduled
Entities, allowing for true multithreading of applications across
multiple CPUs. FreeBSD 5.2 will be released by the end of 2003 and will
focus on improved network and overall performance.

interface (i.e. an RS-232-C interface) in a legacy-free configuration
and after an unsuccessful attempt to convert sio(4). The biggest problem
with sio(4) is that it has been intertwined in many ugly ways into the
kernel's core. Conversion could not happen without breaking something
that invariably affects some group of people negatively. With sio(4) as
a good bad example and a strong desire to solve multiple problems at
once, the idea of an UART (Universal Asynchronuous Receiver/Transmitter)
device that, given its generic name, could handle different flavors of
UART hardware started to settle firmly in the authors mind.

The biggest challenge was of course solving the problem of the low-level
console access prior to the initialization of the bus infrastructure and
still have a driver that uses the bus access exclusively. Along the way
the problem of having an UART function as the keyboard on sparc64 was
solved with the introduction of system devices, which also encapsulated
the console as a system device.

The uart(4) driver can be enhanced to support the various UART hardware
on pc98 and this is currently being worked on. Keyboard support on
sparc64 is underway as well. Plans exist for a rewrite of the remote gdb
support that uses a generic interface to allow various drivers,
including uart(4), to register itself as a communications channel. And
since uart(4) does not support multi- port cards by itself, we likely
need to either enhance puc(4) or otherwise introduce other umbrella
drivers

Still in the planning stage. Working on creating an extensible interface
that is usable for both userland and kernel implementations for device
drivers. Deciding on how to interface userland implemented device
drivers with applications.

WifiBSD is a miniture version of FreeBSD for wireless applications.
Originally for the Soekris Net45xx line of main-boards, but is now
capable of being targeted to any hardware/architecture FreeBSD itself
supports. Although not feature complete, WifiBSD is expected to be ready
for 5.2-RELEASE. The design goal is to meet, or exceed, the
functionality of commercial/consumer 802.11 wireless gear. Features that
need attention (to name just a few) are: http interface, consol menu
interface, and installation. Volunters are welcome.

Wireless Networking Support

Contact: Sam Leffler <sam@FreeBSD.org>

Numerous bugs have been fixed since the last status report (and of
course a few new ones added). Progress on improved security has been
slowed by other work. But new features and fixes are coming in from
other groups that are now sharing the code. In particular NetBSD
recently imported the revised 802.11 layer and the Linux-based MADWIFI
project is using it too (albeit in an older form). The MADWIFI users
have already contributed features such as fragmentation reassembly of
802.11 frames and improved signal monitoring. Power save polling and an
improved rate control algorothm are expected to come in from the NetBSD
folks. WPA support is still in the plans; the best estimate is that work
on that will start in January.
