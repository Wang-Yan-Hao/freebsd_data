Introduction

The FreeBSD Project made substantial progress in the month of August,
2001, both on continuing the development of the RELENG_4 line
(4.x-STABLE and 4.x-RELEASE), and on 5.0-CURRENT, the main development
branch. During this month, the decision was made to push the release of
5.0-CURRENT back so that KSE (support for fine-grained user threads)
could be completed in time for the release, rather than postponing that
support for 6.0. As such, the lifespan of the RELENG_4 line will be
extended, with new features continuing to be backported to that branch.
4.4-RELEASE went into final beta during this month, and will also be
available shortly.

This month's edition of the status report has been written with the
assistance of Nik Clayton and Chris Costello.

Future submissions

For next month, the submission procedures remain the same: reports
should be between one and two paragraphs long, sent by e-mail, and in a
format approximately that of this month's submissions (Project, Contact,
URL, and text). Reminders will be mailed to the hackers@FreeBSD.org and
developers@FreeBSD.org mailing lists at least a week before the
deadline; complete submission instructions may be found in those
reminders.

The aac driver has been given a lot of attention lately and is now
nearly feature complete. Changes include crashdump support, correct
handling of controller initiated commands, and more complete management
interface support. The Linux RAID management tool available from Dell
and HP now fully works; a FreeBSD native version of the tool is also in
the works. These changes have been checked into -current, and will
appear in -stable once 4.4 has been released.

BSDCon Europe

Contact: Paul Richards <paul@freebsd-services.com>

Planning for BSDCon Europe is going well. We're still accepting
proposals for talks but the schedule is starting to fill up so we may
not be for much longer.

An update of the site that includes accommodation information, a
preliminary schedule, a list of speakers and an online payment page will
be launched on Wednesday 19 September.

The fee will be £150 for individuals and £250 for corporations. The
individual pricing is valid only until the end of September, the price
will rise to £200 for October and late registrations in November will be
£250.

The updated website will include a list of sponsorship options, we're
still looking for more sponsorship.

Compressed TCP state

Contact: Jonathan Lemon <jlemon@FreeBSD.org>

State information for TCP connections is primarily kept in the TCP/IP
control blocks in the kernel. Not all of the TCP states make use of the
entire structure, and significant memory savings can be had by using a
cut-down version of the state in some cases. The first phase of this
project will address connections that are in the TIME_WAIT state by
moving them into a smaller structure.

This project has completed the initial research and rough design phases,
with actual code development starting immediately.

NVIDIA Corporation releases Linux drivers by using a combination of
binary object files and source (under a constrictive license). The
FreeBSD NVIDIA driver project aimed to completely replace the source
component of the driver using code targeting FreeBSD 4.3 and released
under the BSD license. The binary module provided is supposedly the same
module used on Windows, BeOS, and OS/2, so it should be portable between
different i80x86 based OS's.

The project is currently on indefinite hold. Our contact at NVIDIA
seemed enthusiastic about the project, and was fairly quick about
returning email, but when we discovered issues that prevented porting
without changes to the binary component or error codes we needed
deciphered, Nick (the contact) said he'd look into it and never got
back. The first major problem was the ioctl interface, the NVIDIA driver
passes a pointer and depends on the kernel side to copyout the right
amount, where FreeBSD expect the parameters to be correct and the
copyout is performed by the subsystem. This was worked around using Dave
Rufinos "ioctl tunnel" idea. After that, we found that X refused to load
and traced it down to an ioctl defined in the binary component erroring.
We cannot tell what that ioctl is, were told that we could not sign an
NDA for source to that component, and have been waiting a month for Nick
to "look into it". Therefore progress is impossible (without breaking
the license) and we believe that the flaws make the driver unportable to
any *nix other than Linux.

2 Gigabit support was integrated on 8/31/2001 (QLogic 2300/2312 cards).
Because of the author's shrinking time commitment for FreeBSD, the
previously planned "next step" which would have been more complete new
CAM Transport integration is now probably just the addition of an FC-IP
adjunct (as this can benefit many platforms simultaneously).

As part of some ongoing development activity, the floppy driver (fdc(4))
enjoyed some overhaul in the past which is part of an ongoing process.
Automatic density selection will come next, something i meant to
implement for years now. As part of that, the entire density selection
stuff has been rewritten. 2.88 MB floppies are on the wishlist as well,

Most of the work this month has focused on development of the native JDK
1.3.1 patchset. The 3rd patchset is out and has been accompanied with
the creation of a FreeBSD "port". This has allowed early adopters much
easier access to the code and naturally resulted in a number of bugs
being found. Development work has mostly focused on fixing these
problems and the project is now set to release fourth patchset over the
weekend, which should see the JDK in a reasonably usable state. One of
the big challenges left is producing a working HotSpot JVM, which looks
like it will require some heavy hacking.

We also welcome OpenBSD's Heikki Korpela to the porting team :)

FreeBSD Release Engineering

Contact: FreeBSD Release Engineer Team <re@FreeBSD.org>

The FreeBSD release engineering process for FreeBSD 4.4 started to ramp
up around August 1st when the "code slush" took affect. During this time
all commits to the RELENG_4 branch were reviewed by re@FreeBSD.org (over
250 code snippets had to be reviewed). After the first release candidate
on August 15th, all submissions were scrutinized under a more strict
potential risk vs benefit curve. The best way to help get involved with
the release engineering process is to simply follow the low volume
freebsd-qa mailing list, help out with the neverending supply of PRs
related to our installation tools (sysinstall), or to work on a possible
next-generation replacement for our installation technology, such as the
libh or OpenPackages projects.

Many companies donated equipment, network access, or paychecks to
finance these activities. Including Compaq, Yahoo!, Wind River Systems,
and many more.

FreeBSD/sparc64 port

Contact: Robert Drehmel <robert@FreeBSD.org>

Sparc64 development is still continuing rapidly and we're making some
excellent progress. Of note, some problems with the way the pmap module
implements copy-on-write mappings have been fixed and fork() now works
as expected, support for signals has been added, and the port has been
updated for KSE in the perforce repository. Thomas Moestl has begun work
on pci bus support, and a basic nexus bus for sparc64 has been written.
The driver for the Sun `Psycho' and `Sabre' UPA-to-PCI bridges and
associated code has been ported from NetBSD (the Sabre is the on-chip
version found in the UltraSparc IIi and IIe). PCI configuration, I/O and
memory space accesses do already work, as well as interrupt assignment
and delivery for devices attached directly to the bridge, and the first
PCI device drivers can attach and seem to work mostly. Interrupt routing
and busdma support still need much work.

Getting GNOME Fifth-Toe metaport ready for 4.4-RELEASE was the main
focus of activity this month. In the process many components were

Current status is that the ia64 kernel builds and runs in a simulator
environment up to single user mode and has been tested lightly in that
environment. My current focus is on completing the ia64 loader so that I
can start to get kernels working on the real hardware. The loader is
coming along well and I expect to be able to load kernels (but not
necessary execute them) soon.

Improved TCP Initial Sequence Numbers

Contact: Mike Silbersack <silby@silby.com>

In mid March, 2001, Tim Newsham of Guardent identified an attack
possible against the initial sequence number generation scheme of
FreeBSD (and other OSes.) In order to guard against this threat, a
randomized sequence number generation scheme was ported over from
OpenBSD and included in 4.3-release. Unfortunately, non-monotonic
generation was found to cause major problems with applications which
initiate continuous, rapid connections to a single host.

In order to restore proper operation under such circumstances while
still providing strong resistance against sequence number prediction,
FreeBSD 4.4 uses the algorithm specified in RFC 1948. This algorithm
hashes together host and port information with a piece of secret data to
generate a unique sequence number space for each connection. As a
result, outgoing initial sequence numbers are again monotonic, but also
unguessable by an attacker.

IP Multicast Routing support

Contact: Bill Fenner <fenner@FreeBSD.org>

FreeBSD's IP Multicast Routing support was recently updated in several
ways. One big change is that it's now able to be loaded as a KLD instead
of statically compiled into the kernel; this is especially useful for
experimentation or updating of an existing system. It also now coexists
nicely with the kernel IP encapsulation infrastructure, so that
multicast tunnels can better coexist with MobileIP, certain IPSec
tunnels and generic IPv4-in-IPv4 tunnels.

and will appear in FreeBSD 4.4 RELEASE. Thus, the new RELEASE version
will be quite stable in terms of IPv6 and IPsec.

The project has assigned a talented guy to be responsible for merge from
KAME to FreeBSD, so future merge efforts will be smoother.

KSE

Contact: Julian Elischer <julian@elischer.org>
Contact: Peter Wemm <peter@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Matt Dillon <dillon@FreeBSD.org>

Work in adding supporting infrastructure to the kernel for KSE threading
support has reached "milestone 2".

Milestone 2 is where the kernel source consistently refers to its
resources in terms of per-thread and per-process resources, in the way
that it will need to when there are > 1 threads per process, but the
LOGICAL changes to such things as the scheduler, and fork and exit, have
not yet been made to allow more than one thread to be created. (nor have
new threading syscalls been added yet). This is an important milestone
as it represents the last point where the kernel has only "mechanical"
changes. To go further we must start adding new algorithms and
functions.

The kernel for milestone 2 is reliable and has no noticeable performance
degradations when compared to a matching -current kernel. (the
differences are less than the margin of error, so that sometimes the new
kernel actually fractionally beats the unaltered kernel).

We hope that by the time this is published, the KSE patches will have
been committed. The Major effect for most developers will be only that
the device driver interface requires a 'thread' pointer instead of a
Proc pointer in the open, close and ioctl entrypoints.

I'm sure there will be small teething problems but we are not expecting
great problems at the commit.

Network device nodes

Contact: Jonathan Lemon <jlemon@FreeBSD.org>

Currently, all network devices (fxp0, lo0, etc) exist in their own
namespace, and are accessed through a socket interface. This project
creates device nodes in /dev for network devices, and allows control and
access in that fashion.

This is experimental work, and suggestions for APIs and functionality
are strongly encouraged and welcomed. In is not clear whether it will be
possible (or desirable) to provide the exact same set of operations that
can be done through the socket interface.

Benefits of approach include the fact that a kqueue filter can be
attached to a network device for monitoring purposes. Initial code
exists to send a kq event whenever the network link status changes.
Other benefits may include better access control by using filesystem
ACLs to control access to the device.

Network SMP locking

Contact: Jonathan Lemon <jlemon@FreeBSD.org>

For 5.0, the goal is for the network stack to run without the Giant
lock. Initial development in this area may focus on partitioning the
code and data structures into distinct areas of responsibilities. A
first pass of locking may involve using a several smaller mini-giant
code locks in order to reduce the problem to a manageable size.

Progress for this month includes the creation of a perforce repository
to officially track the locking changes, and the initial submission of
locks for the &ifnet list. Some code cleanup has also been done to the
main tree in order to better support future locking additions.

PRFW - hooks for the FreeBSD kernel

Contact: Evan Sarmiento <ems@open-root.org>

PRFW is a set of hooks for the FreeBSD kernel. It allows users to insert
code into system calls, for such purposes as creating extended security
features. Last week, PRFW reached 0.1.0, with many bugfixes and
cleaning. I urge anyone who is interested to please visit the site, join
the mailing list. Also take a peek at lsm.immunix.org, the Linux hooks.
It will be a good contrast.

We are making some progress, we are now down to 2170 open PR's down from
an all time high of 3270 just 3 months ago. The aim is still to get rid
of all the dead-wood in the PR database so only relevant PRs in the
database. A big thanks from me to the people who have made this happen!

Contact: Scott Long <scottl@FreeBSD.org>

After two months of little progress, RAIDframe work is gearing up again.
The port to -stable has some known bugs but is fairly stable. The port
to -current was recently completed and patches will be released soon.
RAIDframe is a multi-platform RAID subsystem designed at CMU. This is a
port of the NetBSD version by Greg Oster.

Contact: Bruce Mah <bmah@FreeBSD.org>

RELNOTESng, the DocBook-ified set of release documentation files, has
been merged to the RELENG_4 branch. 4.4-RELEASE will be the first
release of FreeBSD with the new-style release notes, hardware list, etc.
Some of these documents are being translated by the Japanese and Russian
translation teams.

Snapshots of RELNOTESng for CURRENT and 4-STABLE in HTML, text, and PDF
are available at the above URL and are updated irregularly but
frequently. Dima Dorfman <dd@FreeBSD.org> and Nik Clayton
<nik@FreeBSD.org> have been working to have automatically-generated
snapshots on the main FreeBSD web site.

On my TODO list: 1) Resynchronize the FreeBSD installation document with
the installation chapter in the Handbook. 2) Update the hardware lists
(with particular emphasis on PCCARD and USB devices). 3) Update the
infrastructure to allow the architecture-dependent parts of RELNOTESng
to scale to more hardware platforms.

SCSI Tape Support

Contact: Matthew Jacob <mjacob@FreeBSD.org>

A major update to error handling was done on 8/28/2001 which should
correct most of the EOM detection problems that have been around for a
while. There are several things to fix. The principle thing to fix next
is the establishment of a loader(8) mediated device quirks method.

Updates to things from last month:

-   The ast() fixes were committed last month.
-   The work on the preemptive kernel is stalled for the time being. It
    is still unstable on Alpha and SMP systems.

New stuff since last month:

-   sx locks now support upgrades and downgrades.
-   Witness now supports lock upgrades and downgrades.
-   Jason Evans has committed a semaphore implementation.
-   Matt Dillon has pushed Giant down into all of the syscalls.
-   John Baldwin has been working on proc locking in a p4 'jhb_proc'
    branch.
-   John is also currently working on making the ktrace code use a work
    thread to asynchronously write trace data out to the trace file.
    This will make ktrace safe almost completely MP safe with the
    exception that a few ktrace events need Giant in order to call
    malloc(9) and that ktrgenio() is still synchronous. Specifically,
    however, ktrpsig(), ktrsysret(), and ktrcsw() no longer need Giant.
-   Jonathan Lemon has started work on locking the network stack in a p4
    'netlock' branch.

sppp(4) merge

Contact: Joerg Wunsch <j@uriah.heep.sax.de>

sppp(4) should be merged with the ISDN4BSD offspring variant. This will
merge some features and bugfixes from the i4b branch (like VJ
compression), and eventually end up in a single sppp(4) in the tree.
While being at that, incorporating many changes and bugfixes from NetBSD
is considered as well.

SYN cache implementation for FreeBSD

Contact: Jonathan Lemon <jlemon@FreeBSD.org>

The syncache implementation is completed, and currently under testing
and review. The code should be committed to -current in the near future,
and a patchset for -stable made available.

Contact: <trustedbsd-discuss@TrustedBSD.org>

The TrustedBSD project continues to move ahead, with progress made in
the ACL, Capability, and MAC implementations. In addition, support from
DARPA is permitting new work to improve the extended attribute code,
improve security abstractions, and work on security documentation. Due
to the push-back of the FreeBSD 5.0 release, it should now be possible
to include a complete MAC implementation in that release. Specific
status reports appear for components where substantial progress is being
made.

Capabilities support is currently being committed to the base FreeBSD
tree--userland libraries are now fully committed, and kernel
infrastructure is being integrated.
