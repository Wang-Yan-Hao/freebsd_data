Introduction

With the release of FreeBSD 5.5 and FreeBSD 6.1, the second quarter of
2006 has been productive. Google is sponsoring 14 students to work on
FreeBSD as part of their Summer of Code Program (most of which already
submitted a report for elaboration on their projects).

Sun's open-source software is starting to make its way into FreeBSD as a
port of DTrace is nearing completion and a port to the UltraSparc T1
processor (which gives a great push to the ongoing SMP efforts). Having
a powerful debugging tool combined with a CPU that can run up to 32
concurrent threads helps to identify scalability issues.

BSDCan 2006 was yet again a smashing success and much was covered in the
2-day developer summit. As a product of the conference, a new focus on
FreeBSD for the embedded sector has started. Various ARM boards are
targeted, a MIPS32 port is gearing up and people are looking for other
interesting platforms to port FreeBSD to. Preparation for the EuroBSDCon
(in Milan, Italy) on November has already issued a call for papers.

In addition, a lot of spring cleaning is taking place in the network
stack. After conclusion of the KAME project, IPv6 code integration has
been refocused and a fully locked port of SCTP is in the final stage of
integration. Of course, all this goes without noting all the progress
made with the other network projects.

Please read below for more detailed news on the projects that happened
in FreeBSD during the last three months. If you are interested in
helping, consider the "Open Tasks lists" provided with some reports. In
addition we would like to point you at the list of projects and ideas
for volunteers and hope to receive a status report from you next time.

Thanks to all reporters for your excellent work and timing! Enjoy
reading.

  Wiki page      URL: http://wiki.freebsd.org/SnmpBridgeModule
  -------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contact: Shteryana Shopova <shteryana@FreeBSD.org>

As part of my SoC 2006 project I am working on implementing a BRIDGE
monitoring module for FreeBSD's BSNMP daemon. Initial prototyping is
done and some kernel changes are coming to be able to access all needed
data. In addition to IETF RFC 4188, which was designed for monitoring a
single bridge, this snmp module will support monitoring of multiple
bridge devices as supported by FreeBSD.

Open tasks:

1.  Finish kernel changes and the code for the snmp module.
2.  Testing.

  Links   
          URL: http://wiki.freebsd.org/gvirstor
  ------- ---------------------------------------

Contact: Ivan Voras <ivoras@freebsd.org>

The purpose of gvirstor module is to provide the ability to create a
virtual storage device of arbitrarily large size (typically several
terabytes) which consists of an arbitrary number of physical storage
devices (actually any lower-level GEOM providers, including RAID
devices) of arbitrary size (typically 50 GB - 400 GB hard drives).
Storage space from these components is carved into small chunks (for
example 4 MB) and allocated (committed) to the virtual device on
as-needed basis.

Development has started and is progressing as planned (though a little
bit slow). Metadata format and virtual storage allocation formats have
been defined and more serious coding is in progress.

Open tasks:

1.  Much user testing will be needed (though not currently)

Contact: Gábor Kövesdán <gabor@FreeBSD.org>

The improved support for the i386 binaries are ready for -exp run. It
only allows installing such ports on amd64 and ia64 when there's a
compatibility layer compiled into the kernel and the 32-bit libraries
are installed under /usr/lib32.

The DESTDIR support are in progress. It works for the simplest ports
without USE_* that don't have a [pre|do|post]-install target. There are
more complicated issues with e.g. conflict checking in DESTDIR,
deinstalling from DESTDIR, those have to be fixed as well.

Open tasks:

1.  DESTDIR issues should be fixed.
2.  All ports should be examined whether they respect CC/CFLAGS, and the
    erroneous ones should be fixed.
3.  Fetch scripts should be taken out of bsd.port.mk to be separate
    scripts.
4.  A tool should be written that makes possible to cross-compile ports.
5.  A good plist generator tool should be written for porters or the old
    one in ports/Tools/scripts should be updated.

Interrupt handling

Contact: Paolo Pisati <piso@FreeBSD.org>

With the introduction of fine grained locking in the SMPng project, the
FreeBSD kernel went under a major redesign, and many subsystem changed
significantly with it. In particular, device driver's interrupt context
("the bottom half") had the necessity to synchronise with process
context ("the top half") and share data in a consistent manner without
using spl*(). To overcome this problem, a new interrupt model based
around interrupt threads was employed, together with a fast interrupt
model dedicated to particular driver handlers that don't block on locks
(i.e. serial port, clock, etcetc). Unfortunately, even if the interrupt
thread model proved to be a reliable solution, its performance was not
on par with the pre SMPng era (4.x), and thus others solutions were
investigated, with interrupt filtering being one of that.

As part of my Summer of Code 2006 work, I'm implementing interrupt
filtering for FreeBSD, and when the framework will be in place I'll
compare the performance of filters, against all the previous models:
pre-SMPng(4.x), ithread and polling.

The most important modifications to the src tree so far were:

-   made PPC accept more than one FAST handler per irq line (previously
    INTR_FAST implied INTR_EXCL)
-   converted all the INTR_FAST handlers to be filters: return an error
    code to note what they did (FILTER_HANDLED/FILTER_STRAY) and if they
    need more work to do (FILTER_SCHEDULE_THREAD)
-   moved part of the interrupt execution code from MD code to
    kern_intr.c::intr_filter_loop()
-   broke newbus API: bus_setup_intr() grew a new filter parameter of
    type "int driver_filter_t(void*)".
-   converted all the buses that override bus_setup_intr() to handle
    filters
-   converted all the normal ithread drivers to provide a NULL filter
    funcion

The next milestone is to have all the different models (filters only,
ithread only and filter + ithread) work together reliably.

Open tasks:

1.  Arm is largely untested
2.  Sparc64 needs more work on low level (.s) interrupt routine

Contact: Chris Jones <cdjones@freebsd.org>

Project is in development with initial working software expected
mid-July 2006. CPU limits will be implemented with a hierarchical
scheduler: (initially) using a round-robin scheduler to select which
jail to run a task in and then delegating which task in the jail to be
run to a per-jail scheduler.

Open tasks:

1.  Complete round-robin inter-jail scheduler (with existing 4BSD
    schedulers implemented per jail).
2.  Add hooks for memory tracking.

Linuxolator kernel update to match functionality of 2.6.x

  Summer of Code proposal   URL: http://wiki.freebsd.org/RomanDivacky
  ------------------------- -------------------------------------------

Contact: Roman Divacky <rdivacky@freebsd.org>
Contact: Alexander Leidinger <netchild@freebsd.org>

FreeBSD linux emulation layer (linuxolator) currently implements most of
the functionality necessary to emulate 2.4.2 linux kernel, but linux
world has moved forward and current linux world requires 2.6.x features.
The aim of this SoC task is to make Fedora Core 4 linux-base to be able
to run with 2.6.x kernel. Currently this means extending clone() syscall
and implement pthread related things. This involves TLS implementation
(sys_set_thread_area syscall) and possibly tid manipulation (used for
pthread_join etc.) and finally futexes (linux fast user-space mutexes
implementation). This should enable pthread-linked programs to work.
After this is done there may be other things necessary to implement
however, only time will tell. I am funded by google.com in their SoC to
do this work and I'll continue to work on this after the summer
hopefully as a part of my MSc. thesis.

Open tasks:

1.  Finish the TLS thing + other thread related things (tid comes to
    mind and looks necessary for pthread to work)
2.  Futexes also look necessary for pthread to work
3.  maybe other things to be able to run basic programs under 2.6.16

Contact: Michael Bushkov <bushman@FreeBSD.org>

The basic goals of this SoC 2006 project are moving nsswitch-modules out
of the libc, extending the caching daemon and importing nss_ldap into
the base source tree. 2 milestones of the project are currently
completed.

1. Nss-modules were successfully moved out of the libc into the separate
dynamic libraries. In order for static binaries to work properly (they
can't use dynamic nss-modules), nss-modules are linked statically into
the libc.a. As the side-effect of nss-modules separation,
getipnodeby***() functions were rewritten to use gethostby***()
functions and not the nsdispatch(3) call. Caching daemon's
"perform-actual-lookups" option was extended to support all implemented
nsswitch databases.

2. A set of regressions tests was made to test nsswitch-related
functions. These tests are also capable of testing the stability of
these functions' behaviour after the system upgrade.

Open tasks:

1.  Import nss_ldap into the sources tree.
2.  Improve the caching daemon's performance.

Contact: John Birrell <jb@freebsd.org>

Anonymous enablings now work. There is a new option in the boot loader
menu to load the DTrace modules and trace the kernel boot process.

Sun Microsystems has been very supportive of the FreeBSD port and has
generously provided a Sun Fire T2000 server to allow Kip Macy's sun4v
port to be merged into the DTrace project tree.

The DTrace project tree sources are now exported to cvsup10.freebsd.org

Refer to the project page for more details.

Open tasks:

1.  Current effort centres around making DTrace useful for the sun4v
    porting effort which has shown up scalability issues with the
    current FreeBSD SMP implementation. DTrace should be ideal for
    analysing those issues.

TrustedBSD Audit provides fine-grained security event auditing in
FreeBSD 7.x, with a planned merge to 6.x for FreeBSD 6.2. Work performed
in the last three months:

-   Per audit pipe preselection allows IDS applications to configure
    audit record selection per-pipe, new auditpipe.4 document.
-   audit_submit library call to reduce complexity of adding audit
    support to applications.
-   Significant cleanup, bug fixing, locking improvements, token parsing
    and generation improvements.
-   Solaris subject token compatibility, extended address support.
-   Auditing of extended attributes calls, ACL support a work in
    progress.
-   OpenBSM 1.0 alpha 7 integrated into CVS.
-   OpenBSM test tools in progress.
-   Experimental auditeventd which allows shared object plug-ins to
    subscribe to live audit events via a shared pipe in order to support
    the easy authoring of simple intrusion detection and monitoring
    components.

Open tasks:

1.  Bring audit event daemon API and implementation to maturity.
    Currently these are not installed by default in the CVS-merged
    version.
2.  Complete system call coverage.
3.  Allow finer-grained configuration of what is audited: implement
    control flags regarding paths, execve arguments, environmental
    variables.
4.  Support for auditing MAC policy data.
5.  Additional user space application coverage, such as application
    layer audit events from adduser, rmuser, pw, etc.

FreeBSD NFS Status Report

Contact: Chuck Lever <cel@FreeBSD.org>

Mohan Srinivasan committed his changes to make the NFSv2/3 client MP
safe to HEAD this quarter. Changes may be back-ported to 6.x soon.

Robert Watson and Chuck Lever held a discussion about the future of the
in-kernel NFSv4 client during BSDCan 2006. The current NFSv4 client is
unmaintained. Chuck also pointed out the long series of unfixed PRs
against the legacy client (NFSv2/3). These are at the top of his
priority list. Robert is also interested in making NFSv4-style ACLs the
lingua franca for FreeBSD file systems. There was some discussion about
integrating Rick MacKlem's NFSv4 server into 7.x.

Chuck Lever became a full source committer during this quarter.

Contact: Bjoern A. Zeeb <bz@freebsd.org>

As an intermediate step until FreeBSD will have full network stack
virtualisation this work shall provide support for multi-IP IPv4/v6
jails.

These changes are based on Pawel Jakub Dawidek's work for multi-IPv4
jails and some initial work from Olivier Houchard for single-IPv6 jails.

The changes need some more testing but basically things work.

This is not considered to be the right thing todo so do not ask for
official support or if this will be committed to the FreeBSD source
repository.
After some more cleanup of non-jail related IPv6 changes I will publish
a patch for HEAD and perhaps RELENG_6 for everyone who wants to give it
a try anyway.

Open tasks:

1.  (IPv6) related security checks.
2.  Write some tests. Especially IPv6 changes need more testing.
3.  Check what general changes might need merging to HEAD.

Wireless Networking

Contact: Sam Leffler <sam@errno.com>

The wireless support has been stable for a while so most work has
focused on bug fixing and improving legacy drivers.

Max Laier and I worked on improving support for Intel wireless cards.
The results of this work included significant improvements to the iwi(4)
driver (for 2195/2200 parts) and the firmware(9) facility for managing
loadable device firmware. There is also an updated ipw(4) that has
improvements similar to those done for iwi that is in early test.
Support for the latest Intel devices, the 3945 pci-express cards, is
planned for later this summer.

Atheros support was updated with a new hal that fixes a few minor issues
and provides known working builds for SPARC, PPC, and ARM platforms.
There is also working MIPS support that will be used when the MIPS port
is ready to test. Otherwise one useful bug was fixed that affected AP
operation with associated stations operating in power save mode.

wpa_supplicant and hostapd were updated to the latest stable build
releases from Jouni Malinen.

Experimental changes to support injection of raw 802.11 frames using bpf
were posted for comment. This work was done in collaboration with Andrea
Bittau.

Open tasks:

1.  Legacy drivers such as wi are languishing and need maintainers. This
    is prerequisite to bringing in new 802.11 features such as improved
    scanning and virtual ap.

The patches to allow UFS operate with quotas in Giant-less mode are
brewed for long now. Since recent huge pile of fixes into snapshots
code, I think the problems you could encounter are caused solely by the
patch.

Aside performance benefits, patch has another one, much more valuable.
It makes UFS operating in one locking regime whatever options are
compiled into kernel. I think, in long term, that would lead to better
stability of the system.

Open tasks:

1.  I need testers feedback. Both stability reports and performance
    measurements are welcomed !

For some time now I have been working on converting the existing USB
device drivers to my new and mutex enabled USB API. I have converted
"ulpt", "ums", "uhid", "ukbd", "ugen", "uaudio", and a few others.
Around 10 USB device drivers are left to convert. Most of these are
network device drivers.

At the present moment I am working on getting scatter and gathering
support working for all USB host controllers. Scatter and gathering
means that one allocates PAGE_SIZE bytes of memory at a time, and then
fills these memory blocks up as much as possible with USB host
controller structures and buffers. This should solve problems allocating
DMA-able memory when the system memory becomes fragmented.

Open tasks:

1.  If anyone wants to help convert the remaining USB device drivers,
    please drop me an e-mail.

GJournal is a GEOM class which provides journaling for GEOM providers.
It can also be used to journal various file systems with just a minimal
filesystem-specific portion of code. Currently only UFS journaling is
implemented on top of gjournal. Being filesystem-independent and
operating below the file system level, gjournal has no way to
distinguish data from metadata, thus it journals both. One of the nice
things about gjournal is that it works reliable even on disks with
enabled write cache, which is often not the case for journalled file
systems. And remember... fsck no more.

Open tasks:

1.  I'm looking for feedback from users who can test gjournal in various
    workloads.

I have been working on porting missing features in gvinum from vinum, as
well as adding new features.

So far the resetconfig, detach, dumpconfig, setstate (on plexes and
volumes) and stop commands have been implemented, as well as some other
minor fixes. The attach command is currently being implemented, and
started on disk-grouping. Currently most of this is in p4, but patches
will be submitted as soon as possible.

Since the last status report we fixed some more bugs, added basic
support for envy24 chips and cleaned up the source for the emu10kx
driver in the ports to make it ready for import into the base system.

We also got some patches with a little bit of infrastructure for Intel
HDA support. It's not finished and also not usable by end users yet.

Open tasks:

1.  Have a look at the sound related entries on the ideas list.
2.  sndctl(1): tool to control non-mixer parts of the sound system (e.g.
    spdif switching, virtual-3D effects) by an user (instead of the
    sysctl approach in -current); pcmplay(1), pcmrec(1), pcmutil(1).
3.  Plugable FEEDER infrastructure. For ease of debugging various feeder
    stuff and/or as userland library and test suite.
4.  Support for new hardware (envy24, Intel HDA).

Some FPU system and kernel memcpy/copyin/copyout changes have been
performed. In particular, a per-CPU save area has been introduced
(protected with an interlock) in order to assure a stable saving
mechanism. copyout/copyin have changed in order to use vectorised
version of memcpy and an xmm version of memcpy has been provided.

Open tasks:

1.  Benchmarks on different versions of xmm copy, in particular showing
    differences between UP and SMP architectures (evaluating possibility
    to add block prefetch, non-temporal hints usage, etc.)
2.  Modifying npxdna trap handler in order to recognise xmm environment
    usage and replace fxsave with 8-movdqa

The XFS for FreeBSD project is an effort to port the publicly available
GPL'd sources to SGI's XFS filesystem to FreeBSD.

In December, we imported a version of XFS into FreeBSD-CURRENT which
allows FreeBSD to mount an XFS filesystem as read-only.

As a side effort, we have been continuing on the work that PHK started
to clean up the mount code in FreeBSD. We can use the existing FreeBSD
mount(8) utility to mount an XFS partition, without introducing a new
mount_xfs utility.

Open tasks:

1.  We need to implement support for writing to XFS partitions

Hungarian translation of the webpages

The translated webpage is almost ready now. This Hungarian translation
is a "lite" version of the original English webpages, since there are
parts that are irrelevant for the Hungarian community, or has pieces of
data that change quickly, so it's no use to translate these pages now,
maybe later, if we have more Hungarian contributors, but this webpage
would be a good starting point in translating the documentations, and we
need a good place to put translated documentations anyway.

I'm going to be very busy with SoC this summer, but I'll try to find
people that can help me out in this project. Any help appreciated.

Open tasks:

1.  The remaining important pages should be translated.
2.  The press/media/news sections should be restructured somehow to
    being fed from the English webapges, since we don't have too much
    Hungarian resource to make these up to date.
3.  There's a rendering issue when browsing the pages with JavaScript
    enabled, but this can be server-side for me, this should be
    investigated as well.

As an intermediate step towards implementing support for callgraphs and
cross-architecture performance measurements, I am creating a
BSD-licensed library for ELF parsing & manipulation. This library will
implement the SysV/SVR4 (g)ELF[3] API.

Current status: Implementation of the library is in progress. A
TET-based test suite for the API and manual pages documenting the
library's interfaces are being concurrently created.

Work is being done in FreeBSD's Perforce repository. I hope to be ready
for general review by the end of July '06.

Open tasks:

1.  Reviewers are needed for the code and the test suite. If you have
    extensions to the stock SysV/SVR4 ELF(3) API that you would like to
    see in -lelf, please send mail.

FreshPorts has seen several new features recently:

-   caching implemented at web application level to reduce load on the
    database server and to serve pages faster
-   searching expanded to find all the ports that this maintainer
    maintains, and all the commits by a particular committer

Most of the work lately has been optimisation, either at the database
level or at the web application level.

A 2U server was recently donated to the FreshPorts / FreshSource /
FreeBSD Diary / BSDCan group. We have also received a RAID card. Now
we're looking for some hard drives.

Over the past few weeks, work has concentrated on benchmarking the new
server and getting it ready for production. Eventually it will need a
new home as I don't really want it running in my basement all the time
(it's really loud!).

Thanks to iXsystems and 3Ware for their contributions to this project.

During this time, a huge number of ports PRs were committed, bringing us
back down below 800 for the first time since the 5.5/6.1 release cycle.
This is due to a great deal of work, especially from some of our newest
committers.

This is all the more notable given the fact that we have been adding new
ports at a rapidly accelerating rate. We have now exceeded the 15,000
port mark!

Three sets of changes have been added to the infrastructure, including
updates of default versions of MySQL, PHP, LDAP, and linux_base, and
numerous bugfixes and improvements. About 2 dozen portmgr PRs were
closed due to this.

In addition, a large-impact commit was made that attempts to move us to
a single libtool that is as unmodified from 'stock' libtool as we can.
Plans are also in place to do this for the autotools.

Several people are at work on implementing the modularised xorg ports.
Most of the work is done but several key pieces remain. Once this is
finished, an -exp regression test will be needed (most likely, more than
one :-) ) It is possible that before this we will need to do a
regression test that moves X11BASE back into LOCALBASE. This is still
under study.

Gábor Kövesdán started a Google Summer of Code project on some highly
needed improvements on the ports infrastructure (see elsewhere in this
report). As this is a long term project, gtetlow kindly imported the
most important ports infrastructure files into perforce to ease
development. Other developers are encouraged to use perforce for ports
development, especially as it can help keeping patches up-to-date while
going stale in GNATS. Even though linimon has been pushing hard on
running experimental builds on the test cluster, it will take some time
to work through the backlog.

erwin added a ports section to the list of projects and ideas for
volunteers at the FreeBSD website. Have a look if you want to work on
the ports system. Don't hesitate to send additional ideas, and
committers are encouraged to add themselves as technical contacts.

sem adopted portupgrade after it had been neglected for some time and
has been very active on upgrades and bugfixing.

dougb has continued to enhance his portmaster script and people are
finding success with it; although not designed to be as full-featured as
portupgrade, it does seem to be easier to understand and use.

shaun has contributed portscout, a scanner for updated distfiles, to the
ports collection.

marcus upgraded GNOME to 2.14.1.

As well, there have been new releases of the ports tinderbox code.

edwin has been hard at work on a PR-autoassigner for ports PRs, which
has saved a lot of time and been well-received. It has now been
installed on a freebsd.org machine (hub).

linimon has been more active in pursuing maintainer-timeouts, and has
reset a number of inactive maintainers, with more in the pipeline. The
intent is to try to reduce the number of PRs that sit around unanswered
for two weeks. In almost all cases the resets are due to no response at
all; maintainers who are merely "busy" are not the source of most of
these problems, and deserve the benefit of the doubt. Some of the
maintainers that have been reset haven't contributed in months or even
years.

We have added 10 (!) new committers since the last report.

Open tasks:

1.  We need help getting back to our modern low of 500 PRs.
2.  We have over 4,000 unmaintained ports (see, for instance, the list
    on portsmon ). We are always looking for dedicated volunteers to
    adopt at least a few ports.
3.  We can always use help with infrastructural enhancements. See the
    ports section of the list of projects and ideas .

old continent, as well as users and passionates from around the World.
It is also a chance to share experiences, know-how, and cultures.

For the first time, parallel to the main event, an event for
wives/girlfriends/friends will be organised. It will consist of guided
tours of the city of Milan, a probable trip to Como and visits to
various museums. We're also working towards offering a show at the
Teatro alla Scala.

The FreeBSD developer summit will be also held on November 10th.

Open tasks:

1.  The Call For Papers is out, so everybody is invited to send in
    papers or tutorials that might be of interest to the community
2.  The Conference Organisers are also looking for sponsors. Feel free
    to contact oc@eurobsdcon.org in order to discover the different
    sponsoring opportunities.

Contact: Release Engineering Team <re@FreeBSD.org>

The release engineering (RE) team announced the availability of FreeBSD
5.5 and 6.1, both in May 2006. FreeBSD 5.5 is the last planned release
from the RELENG_5 branch in CVS. For the most part, its main features
consist of bugfixes, security patches, and minor updates. We encourage
users to move towards the 6.x series of releases whenever practical.
FreeBSD 6.1 is the latest of the releases to come from the RELENG_6
branch in CVS. It includes (among many other things) improved support
for WiFi devices, additional network and disk controller drivers, and a
number of fixes for filesystem stability. The next release to be issued
from this branch will be FreeBSD 6.2, which is currently scheduled for
September 2006.

The RE team is currently in a ``between releases'' mode. Current
activities include working with security-team@ on some errata fixes for
the RELENG_6_1 branch and producing snapshots of HEAD and RELENG_6 at
the start of each month.

Several personnel changes have taken place recently. Scott Long has
stepped down from his position on the RE team; we thank him for his
considerable efforts over the past four years. In his place, Ken Smith
has taken over the role of lead release engineer. Bruce A. Mah has
rejoined the RE team after a two-year sabbatical.
