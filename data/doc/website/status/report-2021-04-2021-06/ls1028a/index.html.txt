The Semihalf team has been working on adding the FreeBSD support for the
NXP LS1028A SoC.

NXP LS1028A SoC is a dual-core 64-bit ARMv8 Cortex-A72 application
processor with high-speed peripherals such as 2 Time-Sensitive
Networking-capable (TSN) Ethernet controllers, quad-port TSN-enabled
switch, PCIE, SD/MMC, USB3.0 and others.

The newly introduced support includes:

-   ENETC Ethernet and MDIO controllers drivers

-   LS1028A support and other improvements in the FSL SDHCI driver

-   LS1028A clockgen driver

-   Generic PCI improvements:

    -   Add ofw interface support to PCI - commits 28c4e511c23f and
        40429103cd0

    -   Clean up and add proper support for mapping dts nodes to PCI
        devices in pci_host_generic_fdt - commits f0f7b0868a94 and
        ea52e815887b

TODO:

-   Upstream quad-port TSN switch support

Sponsor: Alstom Group
