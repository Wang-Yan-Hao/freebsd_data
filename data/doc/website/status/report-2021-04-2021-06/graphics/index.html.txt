Graphics Driver Update from Linux 5.7

Links: WIP GitHub Repository URL:
https://github.com/neelchauhan/drm-kmod/tree/5.7-wip

We are attempting to update the drm-kmod graphics drivers to the Linux
5.7 code, based on the existing drm-kmod 5.5-wip branch.

Right now, the current version of drm-kmod do not support newer GPU such
as Intel’s Tiger Lake/Iris Xe, used on laptops such as the 2020 HP
Spectre x360. This prevents us from supporting accelerated graphics on
newer hardware containing Intel or AMD GPUs.

Some tasks have already been completed, including:

-   amdgpu bring-up

-   i915kms console bring-up

Some tasks need to be completed, including:

-   i915kms Xorg bring-up (currently pagefaults on remap_io_sg() page
    address)

-   amdgpu VA-API bring-up

-   radeonkms bring-up

We welcome help for the incomplete tasks, especially from users wanting
to use newer hardware (or support FreeBSD-as-a-desktop in general).
