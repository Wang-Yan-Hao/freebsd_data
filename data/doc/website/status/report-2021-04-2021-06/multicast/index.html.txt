Multicast routing rework

Contact: Wojciech Macek <wma@semihalf.com>

The Semihalf team has been working on reworking the existing ip_mroute
module. The previous implementation was over 20 years old and didn’t use
modern kernel features.

A complete rework of locking mechanism was done to eliminate taking
multiple locks for a single job. Some portions of code were modified to
use lockless constructs, the BW-meter API was refactored to work in a
single context and routing hot path was identified and made more
efficient. All these fixes helped achieve over a 5x speed boost in
multicast routing.

The newly introduced rework includes:

-   mroute: fix race condition during mrouter shutting down race
    condition

-   mrouter: do not loopback packets unconditionally loopback

-   ip_mroute: refactor bw_meter API bw_meter

-   ip_mroute: rework ip_mroute locking
