FreeBSD Erlang Ecosystem Ports update

Links:
FreeBSD Erlang wiki URL: https://wiki.freebsd.org/Erlang

Gleam language URL: https://gleam.run/

Contact: FreeBSD Erlang mailing list <erlang@FreeBSD.org>

The Erlang runtime system, commonly known as the BEAM, provides a
runtime that is used by a number of programming languages and
applications in the FreeBSD ports collection.

Notable changes in 2021 include:

-   adding OTP24, including support on amd64 architecture for JIT
    compilation, and dropping the previous NATIVE and HIPE options

-   security fixes for the devel/rebar3 build tool

-   adding a new language runtime for Gleam language

-   more than 40 point release updates in the last quarter alone for the
    Erlang runtimes

As the upstream Erlang OTP team have committed to supporting the 2
current releases, more and more point updates are arriving for OTP22-24,
but not for the older Erlang runtime releases, which are now unlikely to
get security and bug fixes.

The Erlang team is planning to:

-   deprecate in 2021Q3 any ports that are not compatible with OTP
    releases in the last 2 years

-   remove the deprecated runtimes in 2021Q4

-   remove ports directly dependent on erlang- and elixir- languages,
    where they are more commonly installed via mix and rebar3 tools, the
    standard community build tool chain.

-   update RabbitMQ to the next major release, which requires OTP23
    minimum, and introduces support for the JIT

-   bump the main lang/erlang runtime to OTP24 because JIT is awesome

Additional testing and community contributions are welcomed, please
reach out on the mailing list, especially if you are able to help
testing of specific port updates.
