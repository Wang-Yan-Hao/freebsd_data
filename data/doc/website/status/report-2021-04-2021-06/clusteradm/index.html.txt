The FreeBSD Cluster Administration Team consists of the people
responsible for administering the machines that the Project relies on
for its distributed work and communications to be synchronised. In this
quarter, the team has worked on the following:

-   Moved Phabricator (reviews.freebsd.org) to a faster machine

-   Moved https://www.freebsd.org CGI backend to a faster machine

-   Improved the network design of our primary cluster site

    -   Removed public IPv4 connectivity from VLANs not hosting
        public-facing services

    -   Tidied up the pkgbuild and pkgexp VLANs where the production and
        experimental package builders live.

    -   Moved developer reference machines and universe building
        machines to a different VLAN to better accommodate aarch64 and
        ppc64 machines

-   Upgraded the machines running important internal FreeBSD.org
    services

    -   DNS, Kerberos, LDAP, LetsEncrypt.org certbot, etc

    -   FTP, Subversion, Git mirror seed

-   Upgraded the developer reference machines and universe builders to a
    newer FreeBSD 14-CURRENT

-   Upgraded package building machines to newer versions of FreeBSD
    14-CURRENT

-   Assisted postmaster with migrating the mailing lists from Mailman to
    mlmmj

-   Recycled a particularly troublesome PowerPC64 package building
    machine with extreme prejudice (rest in pieces)

-   Installed a new production PowerPC64 package builder

-   Worked with Git migration working group for ports tree migration

-   Ongoing day to day cluster management activity

    -   Putting out fires

    -   Babysitting pkgsync

Work in progress:

-   Move pkg-master.nyi to new hardware

-   Improve to the package building infrastructure

-   Review the service jails and service administrators operation

-   Setup powerpc pkgbuilder/ref/universal machines

-   Search for more providers that can fit the requirements for a
    generic mirrored layout or a tiny mirror

-   Upgrading public-facing cluster services from 12.2-STABLE to
    13.0-STABLE

-   Installing a new cluster site in Japan

    -   Full mirror site (ftp, pkg, git, doc, dns,…​)

    -   The network and machine resources for this mirror are generously
        sponsored by the Cloud and SDN Laboratory at BroadBand Tower,
        Inc., one of the Internet data center service providers in
        Tokyo, Japan, with 300+ Gbps international IP transit bandwidth

-   Improvements to GeoDNS routing, particularly in Asia

-   Working with doceng@ to improve https://www.freebsd.org and
    https://docs.freebsd.org

-   Improve the web service architecture

-   Improve the cluster backup plan
