ENA (Elastic Network Adapter) is the smart NIC available in the
virtualized environment of Amazon Web Services (AWS). The ENA driver
supports multiple transmit and receive queues and can handle up to 100
Gb/s of network traffic, depending on the instance type on which it is
used.

Completed since the last update:

-   Update ENA driver to v2.4.0

-   Update ENA man page

-   Restructure the logging system

-   Hide sysctl nodes for unused IO queues

-   Add support for the large LLQ headers

-   Update HAL version

Work in progress:

-   Introduce full kernel RSS API support

-   Allow reconfiguration of the RSS indirection table and hash key

-   Prototype the driver port to the iflib framework

-   MFC the ENA v2.4.0 driver to the FreeBSD 11/12/13-STABLE branches

-   Support netmap on the c6gn/m6i AWS instance types

-   Fix race between detach function and some of the procedural sysctl
    nodes

-   Add new statistics counters
