Pot is a jail management tool that also supports orchestration through
Nomad.

In the last quarter, v0.12.0 was released and many new improvements have
been worked on since then. The main new feature under development at the
moment is the possibility to create layered pot images for e.g. quickly
adding applications in a build pipeline to a bigger base image which can
then be deployed via Ansible or Nomad.

Potluck aims to be to FreeBSD and Pot what Dockerhub is to Linux and
Docker: A repository of Pot flavours and complete images for usage with
Pot and in many cases Nomad.

Here, all images have been built for FreeBSD 13.0 for the first time,
FreeBSD 11.4 support has been removed and 12.2 images have been upgraded
to latest package versions. Furthermore, new images like a PostgreSQL
Patroni cluster have been added or the Nomad and Consul images have been
extended to support clustering, encryption and a new Vault image.

Also, a PoC has been done which shows that Potluck images can
potentially easily be used with containerd and runj.

Potman aims to simplify building Pot images with Vagrant and VirtualBox
based on the Potluck approach, e.g. as part of a DevOps workflow for
software development including testing and publishing them to a
repository.

Here, in the last quarter, usage and documentation has been improved.

Future plans include finishing the layered Pot images, further Potman
workflow features and more new and improved Potluck images.

As always, feedback and patches are welcome.
