Marvell ARM64 SoCs support

Contact: Zyta Szpak <zr@semihalf.com>
Contact: Kornel Dulęba <mindal@semihalf.com>
Contact: Marcin Wojtas <mw@semihalf.com>

The Semihalf team is working on improving the FreeBSD support for the
Marvell Octeon TX2 CN913x and Armada 7k/8k SoC families.

Marvell Armada 7k8k and Octeon TX2 CN913x SoC families are quad-core
64-bit ARMv8 Cortex-A72 processors with high speed peripherals including
10 Gb Ethernet, PCIe 3.0, SATA 3.0 and USB 3.0 for a wide range of
networking, storage, security and industrial applications.

Although the mentioned SoCs are mostly supported in FreeBSD HEAD, some
pieces required improvements.

Applied changes:

-   Upstream PCIE improvements

    -   PCIE Designware driver (pci_dw) fixes:

        -   Correct setting of outbound I/O ATU window (commit
            57dbb3c25936)

        -   Allow mapping ATU windows bigger than 4GB (commit
            243000b19f8b)

    -   Generic improvements that enable proper user-space mapping and
        access of the PCI BARs - commits f2f1ab39c040 and 1c1ead9b94a1

-   SDHCI improvements

    -   64-bit DMA operation (commit 7d8700bc291b)

    -   sdhci_xenon UHS support (commits 43e31350f8f6-4fa977f854e2)

TODO:

-   Improve and merge ICU support rework (D28803)

Sponsor: Marvell
