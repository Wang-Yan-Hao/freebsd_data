pf syncookie support

Contact: Kristof Provost <kp@FreeBSD.org>

SYN cookies are a mechanism to resist SYN flood denial of service
attacks. The FreeBSD network stack has supported this since 2001.
However, this does not prevent such an attack from flooding the pf state
table.

OpenBSD ported this mechanism from FreeBSD into their pf in 2018. This
code is now being ported to FreeBSD’s pf.

The work is still in progress, but the current version demonstrates the
basic capability. Next steps include additional testing, extra automated
test cases and implementing the adaptive mode.

The adaptive mode requires extra care in FreeBSD’s pf, above what was
done in OpenBSD, because of different locking strategies.
