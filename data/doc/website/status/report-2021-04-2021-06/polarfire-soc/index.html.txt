Microchip PolarFire SoC support

Contact: Jakub Klama <jakub@conclusive.pl>
Contact: Wojciech Kloska <wojciech@conclusive.pl>

The Conclusive Engineering team is working on support for the Microchip
PolarFire FPGA SoC chip family. PolarFire SoC is based on five 64-bit
hard RISC-V cores, out of which four are equipped with MMU and capable
of running FreeBSD. The SoC also features an FPGA and various
peripherals including Gigabit Ethernet, PCIe and multi-function 12.3Gbps
SERDES transceivers.

At the time of writing, the following tasks have been completed:

-   Initial platform bring-up with SMP support

-   Add support for creating "booti"-style images for RISC-V

-   Ethernet support

Work in progress:

-   Clock and reset domain support

-   USB driver

-   PCI Express driver

-   I2C driver

-   SPI driver

-   GPIO driver

-   eNVM driver
