Emacs Ports

PR255706 URL: https://bugs.freebsd.org255706
commit bb995aaf6e25e33b028fa4b32321864b48f49055 URL:
https://cgit.freebsd.org/ports/commit/?id=bb995aaf6e25e33b028fa4b32321864b48f49055

The Emacs development port, editors/emacs-devel, continues to be updated
twice per month to synchronize with the HEAD of upstream’s master
branch. A noteworthy change from the first June 2021 update was the
addition of a NATIVECOMP port option. NATIVECOMP adds support for
compiling Emacs lisp to native code using libgccjit, which was first
enabled in lang/gcc11-devel and is now in lang/gcc11.

For more information about native compilation of Emacs lisp, see Gcc
Emacs Wiki.
