What is helloSystem?

helloSystem is FreeBSD preconfigured as a desktop operating system with
a focus on simplicity, elegance, and usability. Its design follows the
“Less, but better” philosophy.

Q2 2021 Status

-   Version 0.5.0 of helloSystem has been published. Installable Live
    ISO images are available. Download and changelog are at
    https://github.com/helloSystem/ISO/releases/tag/r0.5.0

-   helloSystem was part of the Desktop panel at the FreeBSD Developer
    Summit 2021. A video is available at
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SUKJye54aI&t=11410s

-   Work has started towards 0.6.0. Thanks for contributed features and
    bugfixes

    -   Improved spatial file manager

    -   Switch to KWin (if its dependencies can be reduced significantly
        for use outside of KDE Plasma)

Experimental and release builds of the Live ISO are available at
https://github.com/helloSystem/ISO/releases.

Contributing

Help is wanted in a number of areas, especially in the areas of the
FreeBSD core OS and kernel, and Qt/C++.
