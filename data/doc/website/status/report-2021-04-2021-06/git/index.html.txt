The Git Working Group has been working on ports repository migration to
Git, this task started at the end of the March, beginning with a final
Subversion commit on March 31st to indicate that the conversion started.
The whole migration completed on April 6th. Since 2021Q2, the ports
quarterly branch is created in Git repository only. We continued working
on portsnap and other ports infrastructure to accommodate git.

We continued working on implementing and updating commit hooks. The work
including helped change FreeBSD 13.0 release process to use Git. And we
are sorting and making the infrastructure available to the public, as
well as the documents.

On June 8th, we worked with our ZFS developers to have better tracking
of upstream OpenZFS development. The vendor/openzfs branch was renamed
to vendor/openzfs/legacy. Two new branches were imported directly from
upstream, vendor/openzfs/master and vendor/openzfs/zfs-2.1-release, and
merged to main and stable/13. The details and the required action to
correct the errors might result for the people tracking the old branch
is available at
https://lists.freebsd.org/archives/freebsd-current/2021-June/000153.html

The Git Working Group continues to track progress on two
permissively-licensed git compatible tools: Gitup and Game of Trees.
Gitup is a small, dependency-free tool to clone and update git
repositories. It is used only to keep a local tree up-to-date, and has
no support for local commits.

Game of Trees is a version control client that is compatible with Git
repositories. It provides a user interface and workflow that is distinct
from that of Git. It is in no way intended to be a drop-in replacement
for git, but can be used to develop software maintained in a Git
repository.

Gitup and Game of Trees are currently available as ports and packages.
Future work will evaluate them as candidates for the base system.

The core team began a new effort to investigate and evaluate new
workflow changes in the June 2021 DevSummit. In the third quarter of
2021 we expect to complete the remaining migration tasks and create a
new working group to help with workflow refresh. We’ve wound up our
regular meetings, and the remaining migration tasks are being done by
individuals (Li-Wen Hsu is mainly working on this). The new working
group(s) will have people that participated in this working group as
well as new people who will bring new perspectives to the process.
