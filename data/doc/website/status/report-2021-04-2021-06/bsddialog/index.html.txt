BSDDialog - TUI Widgets

Links:
BSDDialog Project URL: https://gitlab.com/alfix/bsddialog
Dialog Project URL: https://invisible-island.net/dialog
GPLinBase Wiki Page URL: https://wiki.freebsd.org/GPLinBase

Contact: Alfonso Sabato Siciliano <alfonso.siciliano@email.com>

The purpose of this project is to provide an utility and a library to
build scripts and tools with UI Widgets in a terminal. The project is
inspired by Dialog; however BSDDialog is released under the terms of the
BSD-2-Clause License while Dialog is licensed as LGPL so a link of the
project has been added to the "GPL Software in the Base System" wiki
page.

The aim is to provide full compatibility with the dialog utility (the
challenge is to implement over seventy options and almost thirty
widgets). The API compatibility with the library is not a priority
because libbsddialog should meet FreeBSD’s needs, for example it
provides the new mixedlist() function, it can take as argument a set of:
checklists, radiolists and separators, so it could be useful for
building a dialog4ports clone: easier to implement and not depending on
non-permissive dependencies.

BSDDialog is currently under development, no widget is really completed
(autosizing, resizing and scrolling are missing), nevertheless runnable
examples for the utility and the library are inside the example folders
and described in the README.

Finally, a curiosity: BSDDialog started from the MixerTUI code base,
however the original code has been almost completely rewritten.
