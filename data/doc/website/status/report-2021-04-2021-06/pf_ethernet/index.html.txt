Ethernet support for pf

Links:
pf-link in-progress tree URL:
https://github.com/kprovost/freebsd-src/tree/netgate/pf-link

Work is ongoing to add basic support for Ethernet filtering to pf.

This will allow layer 2 addresses to be used to tag packets for
subsequent filtering or shaping in the existing pf code. The layer 2
code is strictly stateless.

The intended use case for this is to improve pf’s capabilities in
captive portal setups (i.e. allow/deny internet access based on client
MAC addresses).

TODO:

-   (optional) anchor support

-   move nvlist interface code into libpfctl

-   audit nvlist code for bugs (several bugs were found in the recent
    nvlist alternatives to existing ioctl calls)

-   (optional) VLAN ID filtering

-   (optional) MAC address table support

While this work is incomplete, feedback on architecture and
functionality is welcomed.
