Contact: FreeBSD Doceng Team <doceng@FreeBSD.org>

The doceng@ team is a body to handle some of the meta-project issues
associated with the FreeBSD Documentation Project, more infomation on
FreeBSD Doceng Team Charter.

During the last quarter, we welcomed back Ceri Davies (ceri@) as a doc
committer. Sergio Carlavilla (carlavilla@) and Danilo G. Baio (dbaio@)
joined the doceng@ team.

A new article was included in the FreeBSD Documentation by Ka Ho Ng
(khng@), Use Language Servers for Development in the FreeBSD Src Tree.

Much work was done regarding the transition to Hugo/Asciidoctor, but
there are still pending issues in the FreeBSD Documentation Project
after the migration. We thank everyone who is helping to find and fixing
them. The TODO items wiki list was refreshed, and everyone is welcome to
contribute to it.
