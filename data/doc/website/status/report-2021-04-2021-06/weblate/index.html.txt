FreeBSD Translations on Weblate

Links:
Translate FreeBSD on Weblate URL:
https://wiki.freebsd.org/Doc/Translation/Weblate
FreeBSD Weblate Instance URL: https://translate-dev.freebsd.org/

Contact: Danilo G. Baio <dbaio@FreeBSD.org>

The Weblate project Documentation (Books and Articles) is open to the
public.

The Automatic Translation feature was executed in all languages,
re-using translations from the former project (Docbook).

There are still pending issues about the new translation process, and
the status can be seen on IdeaList#Translation.

Website translations weren’t released through Weblate yet. So we decided
to hold it until we have more details about the working group that will
redesign the Website and the Documentation Portal, to avoid re-work.
