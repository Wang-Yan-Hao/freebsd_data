Introduction

This report covers FreeBSD related projects between April and June 2007.
Again an exciting quarter for FreeBSD. In May we saw one of the biggest
developers summits to date at BSDCan , our 25 Google Summer of Code
students started working on their projects - progress reports are
available below, and finally the 7.0 release cycle was started three
weeks ago.

If your are curious about what's new in FreeBSD 7.0 we suggest reading
Ivan Voras' excellent summary at:
http://ivoras.sharanet.org/freebsd/freebsd7.html and of course these
reports.

The next gathering of the BSD community will be at EuroBSDCon in
Copenhagen , September 14-15. More details about the conference and the
developer summit are available in the respective reports below.

Thanks to all the reporters for the excellent work! We hope you enjoy
reading.

Contact: Rui Paulo <rpaulo@FreeBSD.org>

Apple's MacBook computers are nicely designed and have neat features
that other laptops don't. While Mac OS X is a nice operating system,
UNIX folks (like me) would prefer to run other operating systems like
FreeBSD. This project aims to bring bug fixes and new drivers to FreeBSD
that would help running this OS on this platform.

Open tasks:

1.  Write drivers or fix issues for/with the touchpad, keyboard, remote
    control IR receiver, Bluetooth.
2.  Fix reboot, halt, suspend/resume issues.

A basic implementation of ar(1) (include ranlib) was finished and
available in the perforce repository. Currently it provides all the main
functions an ar(1) should have and it is based on the libarchive and
libelf library thus is expected to have a better and simpler structure
than the GPL'ed version. The work left in this part of the project is to
perform a elaborate test and add additional functions.

The basic idea behind this project is to implement secure and reliable
log file shipping to remote hosts. While the implementation focuses on
audit logs, the goal is to build tools that will make it possible to
perform distributed logging for any application by using a simple API
and linking with a shared library.

Open tasks:

1.  Network protocol implementation
2.  Spooling
3.  SSL support

  ------- ---------------------------------------

Contact: Ivan Voras <ivoras@FreeBSD.org>

Project "finstall" aims to create a next-generation FreeBSD installer
that will make use of the newest features present in the system. The
project should yield something usable for 7.0-RELEASE, but the intention
is to keep it as a "second" installer system during 7.x, alongside
sysinstall. In any case, sysinstall will be kept for architectures not
supported by finstall (e.g. all except i386 and amd64).

Open tasks:

1.  The work is progressing well and on plan. There's a small setback
    currently with X11 applications executing of a read-only file system
    (at least that's the currently recognizable symptom).
2.  Any interested testers are very much welcome!

Contact: Andrew Turner <andrew@FreeBSD.org>

The project is split up with a front end to interact with the user and a
back end to interact with freebsd-update. The back and front ends are
able to communicate with each other using an XML protocol. The GUI is
almost at the point it can take a command from the user and send it to
the back end. The back end is able to detect when updates are ready.

My previous status reports contained a lot of code that updated gvinum
with the old vinum features.

This year gvinum has been significantly rewritten. Lukas Ertl began
rewriting the way gvinum is organized from using a multi
consumer/provider model, to use a single consumer and provider, and
having an event-system that first handles user-requests, and then runs
normal I/O operations (Much like other GEOM classes). This makes the
code easier to read, and perhaps there will be less bugs :)

1.  setstate on plexes and volumes.
2.  attach/detach command now works.
3.  concat/stripe/mirror commands. The previous code conflicted more
    than I expected with the new gvinum system, but it should work now.
4.  (Mounted) rebuilds possible.
5.  (Mounted) sync possible.
6.  Some refactoring of old code (Basically updating old code to use the
    new event system, and add some abstractions where possible)

And of course, some time has gone to work out how things should be done,
and to fix other bugs. I hope some of you are interested in trying this
out (all the work has been in perforce so far), a patch can be found in
the URL section. . This is a bit experimental, and although I've done
much testing to hunt down bugs, there are most probably bugs left.

I have other goals this summer as well. However, since some parts of
gvinum was rewritten, I might not be able to do all of these, but
growing is already working for the concatenated volumes (and also
mirrored). I'd also like to implement growing for Raid5 arrays as well.
Logging plexes would also be cool to have, but this is not really
needed, since we have g_journal. Both these features will be addressed
after I've made sure gvinum does all old vinum does, and also perhaps
better. As I might have some extra time on my hands this summer, so I
gladly accept suggestions on what else I might fix or implement "while
I'm at it".

Open tasks:

1.  Stability, stability, stability. I want gvinum to work really well.
    To accomplish that I have several test-machines I'm going to do
    different tests on. I sort of have a little test-plan in the working
    that I'll be using.
2.  A gvinumadmin tool that would make gvinum easier to use for
    unexperienced users. Perhaps integrate this into the installer. This
    is now probably something I'll do at the end, when hopefully
    everything works :) I might poke Ivan Voras a bit on this.
3.  Documenting gvinum and it's differences to vinum better. I take
    notes on where I need to document, so this is in progress.
4.  Implementing growing and shrinking of volumes.
5.  Implement logging plexes. Log all parity data being written.

Main goal of project is to introduce code working in PXE preboot
environment, able to download from web server via direct connection or
http proxy and prepare booting of FreeBSD kernel.

Already implemented, but haven't thoroughly tested: PXE wrappers core
code, ARP, ICMP echo request/reply, sockets code similar to common
sockets (UDP and TCP modules). On base of sockets: simple DHCP client,
DNS client.

Currently working on http client, TCP testing, kernel booting and
documenting main concepts of project modules.

Open tasks:

1.  Testing PXE API related code in different PXE implementations.
2.  Testing of implemented protocols.

  Linuxulator update 2007   URL: http://wiki.freebsd.org/linux-soc2007
  ------------------------- --------------------------------------------

Contact: Roman Divacky <rdivacky@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Konstantin Belousov <kib@FreeBSD.org>

Just like last year I got the opportunity to work on updating the
Linuxulator to Linux version 2.6. This year I work on finishing futexes,
*at syscalls and epoll/inotify.

I, cooperating with Konstantin Belousov, have managed to fix futexes to
the state of passing the official futex testing program. The fix was
committed and 7.0R will ship with correct futex implementation. Work is
planned on removing Giant locking from futexes. This only needs some
careful review and testing.

These days I mostly focus on *at syscalls, the patch is almost finished
for committing and I hope that it will make it into 7.0R. As a part of
this work I implemented native FreeBSD syscalls as well. Watch arch
mailing list as I post the patch there.

I also finished writing my master thesis describing how the Linuxulator
works and Gábor Kövesdán is working on integrating it into official
FreeBSD articles.

No work has happened in the epoll/inotify area but I hope to work on it
right after I finish the *at syscalls.h

Open tasks:

1.  Finishing *at syscalls.
2.  Start the epoll/inotify work.
3.  Finish removal of Giant from futexes.

lockmgr rewriting

  ------------------------------------ -----------------------------------------

Contact: Attilio Rao <attilio@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Jeff Roberson <jeff@FreeBSD.org>

The project consists in a rewriting of the lockmgr(9) interface on a
lighter basis, using atomic instructions and direct usage of the
sleepqueue interface. This should lead to a faster primitive, a saner
interface and an higher maintainability of the code.

So far, 3 newly files called kern/kern_lockng.c, sys/_lockmgrng.h and
sys/lockmgrng.h have been created for the new primitive and an initial
implementation has been committed into the perforce branch:
//depot/user/attilio/attilio_lockmgr/...

The implementation contains a good set of code intended to replace old
lockmgr. Actually it only misses the support for lock draining that will
be committed after an initial phase of testing and the inclusion of a
better wake-up algorithm (which will simplify draining a lot and will
improve performance on wakeup).

Open tasks:

1.  Need some testing

mtund - Magic Tunnel Daemon

  ----------------- ------------------------------------------------

  mtund wiki page   URL: http://wiki.freebsd.org/SuperTunnelDaemon
  ----------------- ------------------------------------------------

Contact: Matus Harvan <mharvan@FreeBSD.org>

IP can easily be tunneled over a plethora of network protocols at
various layers, such as IP, ICMP, UDP, TCP, DNS, HTTP, SSH. While a
direct connection may not always be possible due to a firewall, the IP
packets could be encapsulated as payload in other protocols, which would
get through. However, each such encapsulation requires the setup of a
different program and the user has to manually probe different
encapsulations to find out which of them works in a given environment.

mtund is a tunneling daemon using run-time loadable plugins for the
different encapsulations. It automagically selects the best
encapsulation in each environment and fails over to another
encapsulation in case the environment changes. There already is running
code available, capable of tunneling via TCP and UDP with a working
failover mechanism. As this is a Summer of Code project, rapid changes
and addition of new features can be expected during the summer. Please
see the wiki page for more details and up-to-date information.

Note that the project originally started under the name of Super Tunnel
Daemon, but was later renamed to mtund for Magic Tunnel Daemon.

Open tasks:

1.  I am always happy to hear from others trying out the code and
    providing feedback, both positive and negative.

  ------- -------------------------------------------

Contact: Fredrik Lindberg <fli@FreeBSD.org>

This project aims to create a multicast DNS daemon and service discovery
utilities suitable for the base system. Multicast DNS is a part of Zero
Configuration Networking (Zeroconf) and provides the ability to address
hosts using DNS-like names without the need of an existing (unicast),
managed DNS server. Work on the responder daemon is well underway and
the only large missing piece of the puzzle is a way for local clients to
do queries. The code can be found in the p4 branch
projects/soc2007/fli-mdns_sd if anyone would like to give it a spin,
even though it's incomplete. The project plan can be found on the wiki.

Porting Linux KVM to FreeBSD

  ------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Contact: Fabio Checconi <fabio@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Luigi Rizzo <luigi@FreeBSD.org>

The Linux kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) is a mechanism to exploit
the virtualization extensions present in some modern CPUs (e.g., Intel
VT and AMD-V). Virtualization extensions let ordinary processes execute
a subset of privileged instructions in a controlled way at near-native
speed. This in turn may improve the performance of system emulators such
as qemu, xen, vmware, vkernel, User Mode Linux (UML), etc.

This project consists in porting to FreeBSD the Linux KVM, implemented
as a loadable module, lkvm.ko. We use the approach in
ports/devel/linux-kmod-compat to reuse the original Linux source code
almost unmodified. We will also port a modified version of qemu which
exploits the facilities made available by the Linux KVM to speed up
emulation.

The URL above links to progress report detailing the exact project
goals, milestones reached, and commit log details.

As of end of June 2007, we have mainly extended linux-kmod-compat to
support the kernel API used by the Linux KVM code. The required
functions have been implemented at various degrees, from simple stubs to
fully functional ones. We have also imported the modified qemu and the
libraries that are used to build the Linux KVM userspace client. In the
second half of the SoC work we plan to complete the implementation of
the kernel API and have a fully functional Linux KVM module, together
with its client (qemu).

OpenBSD includes sysctl hw.sensors framework since 2003; since 2005 the
frameworks supports raid drives and most known i2c sensors; since 2006
the framework is redesigned with a sensor device concept in mind to
accommodate continued growth. Consists of kernel api,
sysctl(3)/sysctl(8), sensorsd(8), ntpd(8), systat(1),
ports/sysutils/symon and 51 drivers as of 2007-07-07.

This GSoC2007 project is to port the underpinnings of this unified
hardware monitoring interface to FreeBSD. Whilst it won't be possible to
port all of the drivers due to architecture differences, we aim at
porting all other parts of the framework and accompanying userland
utilities.

At this time, lm(4) at isa and some kernel api have already been ported.
The next big step is to complete sysctl(3) glue code so that further
work on porting userland utilities could be accomplished. Details about
sysctl are being discussed on arch@.

Open tasks:

1.  sysctl(3) glue code

Security Regression Test

Security Regression Test is supported by the project of Google summer
code 2007. The main objective of this stage is to test the correctness
of FreeBSD Mandatory Access Control Framework including correctly
passing the security label from userland to kernel and non-bypassibility
of Mandatory Access Control Hooks.

Work performed in the last month:

1.  Constructed a pair of pseudo ethernet drivers used for testing
    network related hooks. To avoid the packet go through the lo
    interface, the IP address in the packet is twisted in the driver.
2.  Constructed a framework for logging Mandatory Access Control hooks
    which is got called during a period of time.
    -   In kernel, every non-null label is got externalized into human
        readable string and recorded in a tail queue together with the
        name of hook that got called and possible flags or modes (etc.
        VREAD/VWRITE for mac_check_vnode_open hook). There is a thread
        much like audit subsystem's audit_worker logging the queue into
        a userspace file. The userland program use open, ioctl and close
        the /dev/mactest node to trigger and stop the logging. The
        logging file is truncated to zero every time the logging
        mechanism is triggered.
    -   In userland, a bison based parsing tool is used to parse the
        logged file and reconstruct the record chain which will be
        compared with testsuite supplied configuration file to examine
        if expected hooks is got called and the label/flags/modes are
        correct. c) The testsuite mainly follows
        src/tools/regression/fstest, modified to adapt to test Mandatory
        Access Control Framework and include tests for signals

Open tasks:

1.  The code is quick and dirty. For example, a call to vn_open without
    checking its return value which is not fault tolerance. The coding

2.  Although a test framework is completely constructed, the detailed

tarfs: A tar File System

  ------------ -------------------------------------------------

  TarFS Wiki   URL: http://www.googlebit.com/doku.php?id=tarfs
  ------------ -------------------------------------------------

Contact: Eric Anderson <anderson@FreeBSD.org>

Tarfs is a simple tar file system implementation for FreeBSD.

The current goals are:

-   Support all standard read-only operations
-   Support large tar files (several gb's)
-   Use minimal memory
-   Allow using tar file as a root file system
-   Fast enough to actually use

Here's the current state of things:

-   Can mount most tar files
-   Can do most operations (open,lookup,stat,readdir,etc)
-   Supports large tar files (tested up to 2GB)
-   Uses a relatively small amount of memory - proportional to number of
    files/dirs

Open tasks:

1.  No `..' directory in root of mounted tar file system
2.  Locking issues regarding `..' in subdirs off root of fs
3.  No block/char special device support. Needed?
4.  Needs a directory hashing method
5.  More testing needed.

Contact: Rink Springer <rink@FreeBSD.org>

Work is well under way to finish Kip Macy's FreeBSD/xen port, and get it
into a shape which is suitable for inclusion in 7.0.

Generally, the port is stable and performs quite well. The major
bottleneck is the inability to work with GCC 4.2, this is the last major
TODO before the work can be committed.

Open tasks:

1.  Fix the port to correctly work with GCC 4.2.
2.  Port the Xen drivers to newbus.
3.  Test/fix PAE support.
4.  Start on amd64 support.

Contact: John-Mark Gurney <jmg@FreeBSD.org>

This entry was previously the Bt878 Audio Driver (aka FusionHDTV 5 Lite
driver) announcement, but as work expanded slightly, it's a bit more
generic now.

A few bugs in bktrau has been fixed since January. If you have been
running an earlier version, it is recommended to upgrade as the driver
could panic. The driver works with multiple cards in the same machine
(tested with two).

FusionHDTV 5 Lite -- Due to lack of documentation from DViCO and LG, I
have copied magic values from the Linux driver to get ATSC capturing
working.

ATI HDTV Wonder -- After years of trying to get into the ATI developer
program, they have finally suspended it, so no support from ATI. I have
started work on a driver, cxd, for the Conexant CX2388x based cards. The
ATI HDTV Wonder uses ATI's own demodulator, and I was able to get it to
tune, after cribbing from the Linux driver. When capturing, I get some
valid data, but not all the data. Due to lack of support from ATI and
linux-dvb the project has been put on indefinite hold.

If someone has another CX2388x based card, it shouldn't be too hard to
take the driver and get it working with a different tuner.

A Python module is available for both drivers/cards, along w/ a sample
capture application using it. The module is now known to work well with
threads so that tuning (expensive due to i2c ioctl's) can happen in
another thread without causing program slow down. The module is working
well with a custom PVR backend.

Open tasks:

1.  Provide support for NTSC and FM tuning.
2.  Add support for other cards and tuners that use the Bt878 chip.
3.  Add support for other cards and tuners that use the CX2388x chip.

FreeBSD developers have been using mysql as a testbed to find kernel
contention hotspots in the kernel. As a result of this we have seen a 5x
performance improvement over 6.0 on 8way machines. Recent changes
include finer locking in fcntl(), removing Giant from flock and fcntl
F_SETLK. These changes will be available in 7.0 and primarily improve
write performance. Experimental changes to select() have also been
discussed on arch@ that solve contention issues there however these will
not be ready in the 7.0 timeframe.

General cleanups in preparation for 7.0.

Process audit state moved to the credential to allow it to be accessed
lock-free in most cases, as well as allowing it to be used in
asynchronous contexts.

OpenBSM 1.0a14 has been imported, which: fixes IPv6 endian issues, makes
OpenBSM gcc41 warnings clean, teaches audit_submit(3) about
getaudit_addr(), adds zonename tokens; other changes since the existing
CVS 1.0a12 release previously imported include man page improvements,
XML printing support, better audit.log.5 documentation, additional
64-bit token types, and new audit event identifiers.

MAC checks have been added so that MAC policies can control use of audit
system calls.

Additional system call arguments are now audited.

Audit now provides a security.audit sysctl node in order to determine if
audit support is compiled in; boot-time console printfs have been
removed.

"options AUDIT" is now in the 7-CURRENT GENERIC kernel, so AUDIT support
will be available out of the box in 7.0 without a kernel recompile.
Manually enabling audit support in rc.conf will still be required. With
FreeBSD 7.0, AUDIT will be a fully supported, rather than experimental,
feature.

Cleanup of MAC Framework API/KPI layers: mac.h is now just the user and
user<->kernel API; mac_framework.h is the kernel<->MAC Framework KPI,
and mac_policy.h is the MAC Framework<->MAC policy module KPI. Along
similar lines, mac_label_get() and mac_label_set() accessor functions
now allow policies to access label data without encoding struct label
binary layout into policy modules, opening the door to more efficient
layouts. struct label is now in mac_internal.h and used only inside the
MAC Framework.

General MAC policy cleanup, including removing no-op entry points and
sysctls for some sample policies. mac_test(4) has been cleaned up
significantly, and counters for all entry points added.

A MAC check for UNIX domain socket connect has been added.

MAC checks have been added so that MAC policies can control use of audit
system calls.

MAC checks that duplicate existing privileges but add no additional
context have been removed (such as sysarch_ioperm, kld_unload, settime,
and system_nfsd) -- checks aligned with privileges but that do provide
additional context, such as additional arguments, have been kept.

The Biba and LOMAC policies now implement priv(9) checks,
differentiating between privileges that may compromise system integrity
models, and those that don't.

The essentially unused mnt_fslabel / mnt_label distinction has been
eliminated by moving to a single mnt_label. No functional change to any
policy.

Several MAC-related interfaces have been modified to synchronize with
the naming conventions present in the version of the MAC Framework
adopted in Mac OS X Leopard; significant further changes are in the
pipeline to complete this synchronization. While it will not be possible
to reuse a policy between the two platforms without careful thinking and
modification, this makes porting much easier.

During the last three months there has been several changes to the USB
stack. Here is a quick list of the most important changes:

1.  FULL speed isochronous devices over HIGH speed USB Hubs are now
    fully supported. Due to various reasons the maximum isochronous
    bandwidth has been limited to 6MBit/s. This limit is tunable.
2.  There is now full support for Linux USB device drivers through a
    Linux USB API emulation layer.
3.  Various cleanups and fixes.

Markus Brueffer is still working on the USB HID parser and support.
Nothing has been committed yet.

If you want to test the new USB stack, checkout the USB perforce tree or
download the SVN version of the USB driver from my USB homepage. At the
moment the tarballs are a little out of date.

Ideas and comments with regard to the new USB API are welcome at

USB update

  -------
  Links
  -------

Contact: Warner Losh <imp@FreeBSD.org>

About 18 months ago, I started to remove the compatibility macros that
we had in the USB stack. These macros made it very hard to read the code
and to diagnose problems. They represented a barrier to entry for people
reading and understanding the stack. In addition, many of them
effectively hid bugs from all but the most intensive investigations of
the code.

I've removed almost all of the macros in the client drivers, and all
instances of the macros in the core FreeBSD USB stack. This makes the
drivers more readable, and a little more robust. During this process, I
fixed a lot of little bugs that people had been tripping over, and some
that people hadn't reported. I've added a boatload of new vendor and
product ids to the drivers from user PRs as well as from OpenBSD/NetBSD
drivers.

I finished up this work so that the FreeBSD USB stack would be more
maintainable during the RELENG_7 period of time. I plan on MFCing most
of the changes I've made into RELENG_6 after they have been shaken out
in current. There was only one API changes in this work, so this is
doable, and makes sharing drivers between 6.x and 7.x much easier. At
this stage, it is unclear how long RELENG_6 will be around, so I'm
hoping this will make USB much better in 6.3 if that's the release
people choose to run.

I've shied away from many of the more complicated changes to the stack.
There's work being done outside of the tree by Hans Petter Selasky (hps)
to make these sorts of changes. There is much in his stack that's ready
to be merged, and I hope to integrate from that work useful bits that
can be merged without disruption to improve the FreeBSD USB stack.

I'm also looking for other FreeBSD developers that can jump in and help.
Nearly all of the improvements I've done by spending a few hours a week
sorting through the PRs for extremely low hanging fruit. There's plenty
of room for others to be involved as well in improving FreeBSD's USB
stack, as well as chances for us to import the now-useful bits from the
evolving hps USB stack, hopefully reducing the diffs between it and the
present FreeBSD USB stack. In addition, I'm looking for someone to do
similar device ID merges from DragonFlyBSD.

Finally, I've embarked on a mission to try to merge all the BSD's
usbdevs files. There's no reason to have separate ones. I've started to
modify usbdevs(1) to read the src/sys/dev/usb/usbdevs file and report
more verbose information that way. A merged usbdevs would be larger, and
take up more memory in a USBVERBOSE kernel, so to mitigate that effect,
I'm making changes to usbdevs(1).

Open tasks:

1.  The biggest area of concern before the 7.0 release is to get the
    updated device lists into the manual pages. This task is too big for
    me to take on in addition to the work I'm doing in cleaning up.
2.  We need more people that are willing to help out on the 'trivial'
    PRs that add IDs to the driver. In addition, we need people to
    periodically sync our driver lists with DragonFlyBSD, NetBSD, and
    OpenBSD drivers.
3.  Merging the other BSD's usbdevs tables would be very helpful.
4.  Writing a usbdevs parser for usbdevs(1) to use.

The ports count is over 17,300. The PR count has been stable at around
800; we have not quite cleared up the backlog that showed up during the
freeze to import xorg7.2.

There have been 4 experimental runs on the build cluster, most notably
resulting in some speedups for package registration. A further
experimental run to genericize autotools handling is in progress.

One of the most sweeping ports commits to happen in years was the
upgrade of xorg from 6.9 to 7.2. This involved a complete rework of the
internals of the port, as X.org itself has effectively pushed the
responsibility for packaging to the OSes that incorporate it. The idea
was to be able for them to update individual code (such as video
drivers) without having to reroll the entire distribution. This commit
caused us to have the longest period of preparation work, and actual
tree lockdown, that I am aware of. The commit continues to be
controversial, partly due to the fact that none of our port upgrade
tools was up to the task of doing the upgrade without manual
intervention.

At the same time that xorg was upgraded, we moved the installation
directory from the obsolete /usr/X11R6 to our default /usr/local. This
further complicated the upgrade.

There have been new releases of the ports tinderbox code, the portmaster
update utility, and portupgrade.

GNOME was updated to 2.18.2.

We have added 7 new committers since the last report. We appreciate all
the new help. However, a few committers have turned in their commit bits
for safekeeping, due to lack of time.

Unfortunately, Clement Laforet has also had to step down from portmgr
due to lack of time. We thank him for his help so far.

Erwin, Kris and Mark met up at BSDCan and reviewed all the portmgr-owned
PRs. A large number were closed, or suspended pending more work from the
submitter. After closing the PRs that were committed after the -exp
builds, the number of portmgr owned PRs came down to an all time low of
48 from around 70. We hope to make further progress during the rest of
the year.

Open tasks:

1.  gcc4.2 has been imported to the base for 7.0. Unfortunately, this
    breaks a large number of ports. We need committer and maintainer
    help to get these in good shape for the release.
2.  Most of the remaining ports PRs are "existing port/PR assigned to
    committer". Although the maintainer-timeout policy is helping to
    keep the backlog down, we are going to need to do more to get the
    ports in the shape they really need to be in.
3.  Although we have added many maintainers, we still have many
    unmaintained ports. The packages on amd64 are lagging behind a bit;
    those on sparc64 require even more work.

Gavin Atkinson has joined the bugbuster team via getting a GNATS account
on the FreeBSD cluster. He is following in the footsteps of Matteo
Riondato, who later graduated to a full src commit bit. So far, he has
helped close nearly 150 PRs, including many that had become stale.
Welcome!

Our short-term goal is to try to identify bugs that we might be easily
able to fix before the 6.3/7.0 simultaneous release. So far, great
progress has been made on ata- and usb-related PRs.

The goal for the rest of this year is to generate more developer
interest in fixing bugs. To do this, we are, first, trying to do more
work on triaging PRs as they come in, to help flag ones that seem to be
valid problems (especially if they include patches.) Secondly, we have
started a new weekly periodic posting to the
freebsd-bugbusters@FreeBSD.org mailing list, which is a short list of
PRs that we feel are ready for committer action. This posting is
automatically generated from a text-file list that we maintain.

We are continuing to try to manage our community's expectations of what
we can do with the incoming PRs. In particular, we are trying to
discourage submissions of the form "I cannot get the XYZ function to
work". In practice, these PRs are not worked on. Instead, we are now
encouraging these postings to go to one of the mailing lists such as
freebsd-questions@, freebsd-x11@, and so forth. The idea is to emphasize
GNATS as a "Problem Report" method, rather than a "general FreeBSD
support" method. I feel that, otherwise, we were creating a false
expectation.

The overall PR count has dropped to below 5000, despite the extra PRs
still not cleared up from the ports freeze for the xorg7.2 import.
Significant progress has been made on the i386, kern, and bin PRs, as
well as PRs in the 'feedback' state. In addition, Warner Losh has made
progress on closing many of the usb PRs.

Open tasks:

1.  Please join us on the freebsd-bugbusters@ mailing list, or on
    #freebsd-bugbusters on EFNet, to help us triage PRs as they come in
    and also help us to work through the backlog, and help us to try to
    create a bugbusting "community".

Code freeze in preparation for FreeBSD 7.0 began on June 18th. There are
several large projects still being finished up as well as some issues
that resulted as "fallout" from the work done just before the code
freeze started (e.g. things resulting from the GCC 4.2 import). A
schedule for the 7.0 release has not been set yet but the hope is that
the first BETA build will be done near the end of July with a "fairly
normal" release cycle (a few BETA builds followed by two or three RCs,
each separated by around two weeks).

We are planning to release FreeBSD 6.3 around the same time as FreeBSD
7.0 is released so the release schedule for that will be set at the same
point we set the release cycle for 7.0, hopefully late in July.

these problems were in "contributed" code maintained outside of FreeBSD.
The FreeBSD Vulnerabilities and Exposures Markup Language (VuXML)
document has continued to be updated; since the last status report, 35
new entries have been added, bringing the total up to 925.

In order to improve handling of security issues in the FreeBSD Ports

committers who periodically help with fixing ports security issues and
documenting them in the FreeBSD VuXML document. Committers who wish to
help with this effort can contact simon@ for details.

The following FreeBSD releases are supported by the FreeBSD Security
Team: FreeBSD 5.5, FreeBSD 6.1, and FreeBSD 6.2. The respective End of
Life dates of supported releases are listed on the web site; it is
expected that of the upcoming releases, FreeBSD 6.3 will be supported
for two years after release, while FreeBSD 7.0 will be supported for one
year after release.

Over the past 6 months several developers undertook an effort to replace
the global scheduler lock with a finer-grain interface modeled on the
Solaris container lock approach. This significantly reduces contention
on higher-end multiprocessor machines.

This patch went into 7.0-CURRENT and has proven to be very stable. The

whether this will go into 7.0 as SCHED_SMP or as SCHED_ULE in 7.0 or
7.1.

SCHED_ULE has had many bugfixes and performance improvements over the
7.0 development cycle and should no longer be considered unstable or
experimental. On most workloads it significantly outperforms SCHED_4BSD
on SMP and even slightly outperforms it on UP. There are some
pathlogical workloads which exhibit as much as a 5% performance penalty.
Many thanks to Kris Kennaway and current users for bug reports and
performance testing.

Further reduction of suser(9) consumers in order to attempt to remove
the suser(9) KPI for 7.0. This includes resource limits, System V IPC,
PPP, netinet port reuse, the NFS server, and netatalk. Remove
unnecessary or redundant privilege checks were possible. UFS-privileges
that apply to other file systems have been renamed to VFS privileges.

All suser_cred() flags and priv_check_cred() flags are no longer
required, as SUSER_ALLOWJAIL and SUSER_RUID use are determined entirely
inside kern_jail.c and kern_priv.c and selected based on the privilege
number, not a calling context flag. All privileges are now consistently
allowed or not allowed in jail, and consistently use the ruid or euid.
We will leave the flags field there as it will likely be used for other
things in the future.

Documentation in suser(9) and priv(9) has been updated.

Network Infrastructure

10Gigabit Network Support

Contact: Kip Macy <kmacy@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Andrew Gallatin <gallatin@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Jack Vogel <jfv@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Robert Watson <rwatson@FreeBSD.org>

Support was added for two more 10gigabit network drivers and there were
major advances on improving system performance over 10g media.

Kip Macy committed a new driver for the Chelsio adapters. The cxgb
driver supports all current 10g adapters, as well as the new four-port
gigabit model. The cxgb driver work was supported by Chelsio.

Drew Gallatin made significant improvements to the Myricom 10g driver
mxge. With these updates the driver does line rate transfers with less
system overhead.

Neterion contributed the nxge driver to support all their Xframe 10Gbe
Server/Storage adapters. The initial driver import was done by Sam
Leffler; a switch over to vendor support will happen soon.

Jack Vogel is preparing a driver to support the latest Intel 10g
hardware devices. The new driver - ixgbe - will complement the existing
ixgb driver that supports older Intel 10g cards.

Kip and Drew worked with other folks on performance analysis and tuning.
This work improved cpu affinity and reduced overhead for managing
network resources. Work is also underway to define a common Large
Receive Offlaod (LRO) infrastructure. LRO is analogous to TSO on the
receive side enabling drivers to receive at near line rate with normal
sized frames. This common code base will help replace driver-specific
code.

FreeBSD and Wake On Lan

  ------- ----------------------------------------------------------------

Contact: Stefan Sperling <stsp@stsp.name>

I have been working on making wake on lan (WOL) work with FreeBSD.
Contrary to popular believe OS support is required for WOL to work
properly. In particular network card drivers need to configure network
cards for WOL during system shutdown, else the cards won't wake up. WOL
is _not_ just a BIOS issue.

This is work in progress. Currently the following cards/chipsets are
supported:

-   NatSemi DP83815 (if_sis)
-   Via Rhine (if_vr, only VT6102 and up chips support WOL)
-   Nvidia nForce (if_nve, needs testing )
-   3Com Etherlink XL and Fast Etherlink XL (if_xl, needs testing , only
    3c905B type adapters support WOL)

I would be glad to get more feedback on my patch. I can add support for
more chipsets but I need testers for hardware I don't have. I would
appreciate access to data sheets for any NIC chipsets that are supported
by FreeBSD and have WOL support.

I would especially appreciate technical feedback on the patch,
preferably by a committer who is willing to nitpick the patch to make it
ready for inclusion in -CURRENT. I currently maintain the patch against
RELENG_6_2 for my own use but I would port it to -CURRENT for inclusion.

Multi-link PPP daemon (MPD)

  -------------- -----------------------------------------------
  Links          
  Project home   URL: http://sourceforge.net/projects/mpd/
  ChangeLog      URL: http://mpd.sourceforge.net/doc/mpd5.html
  -------------- -----------------------------------------------

Contact: Alexander Motin <mav@FreeBSD.org>

Mpd-4.2 has been released. It includes many new features, performance
improvements and fixes.

The most significant and unique new feature is a link repeater
functionality. It allows mpd to accept incoming connection of any
supported type and forward it out as same or different type outgoing
connection. As example, this functionality allows mpd to implement real
LAC with accepting incoming PPPoE connection from client and forwarding
it using L2TP tunnel to LNS. All other software L2TP implementations I
know is only a LAC emulators without real incoming calls forwarding
abilities.

Also mpd-4.2 presents:

-   PPTP listening on multiple different IPs,
-   L2TP tunnel authentication with shared secret,
-   fast traffic filtering, shaping and rate-limiting using ng_bpf and
    ng_car,
-   new 'ext-auth' auth backend as full-featured local alternative to
    'radius-auth',
-   NetFlow generation for both incoming and outgoing packets same time.

Replacing external ifconfig and route calls with their internal
implementations and other optimizations in 4.2 gave significant
performance boost in session management. Newly implemented overload
protection mechanism partially drops incoming connection requests for
periods of critical load by monitoring daemon's internal message queue.
As result, simple 2GHz P4 system is now able to accept, authenticate and
completely process spike of 1000 concurrent PPPoE connections in just a
30 seconds.

Open tasks:

1.  Implement dynamic link/bundle creation.
2.  Auth proxying support in repeater mode. It is required for some
    LAC/PAC and Tunnel Switching Aggregator (TSA) setups.
3.  Remove static phys - link - bundle and phys - repeater relations.
    Implement ability to differentiate incoming connections processing
    depending on user login, domain and/or other parameters.

The custom file descriptor array lock has been replaced with an
optimized sx lock, resulting in 2x-4x improvement in MySQL transaction
rates on 8-core MySQL benchmarks. This improvement is due to moving to
shared locking for frequent fd lookup operations, as well as significant
optimization of the case where the filedesc lock is highly contended (as
occurs in the threaded MySQL server performing constant socket I/O).

The custom socket buffer I/O serialization lock (sblock), previously
created by interlocking SB_WANT and SB_LOCK flags with the socket buffer
mutex, has been replaced with an optimized sx lock, leading to a 10%
performance improvement in MySQL and PostgreSQL benchmarks on 8-core
systems. As part of this change, sx locks now have interruptible sleep
primitives to allow the SB_NOINTR flag to work properly.

These changes also correct a long-standing bug in socket buffer lock
contention and SB_NOWAIT reported by Isilon; a simpler patch has been
merged to 6.x to fix this bug without merging loocking changes.

TCP debugging is now properly synchronized using a new tcp_debug_mtx.

UMA allocation counters are now used for pipes rather than custom atomic
counters, resulting in lowered overhead for pipe allocation and free.

Significant code cleanup, commenting, and in some cases MFC'ing, has
taken place with respect to the network stack and synchronization.
Additional DDB debugging commands for sockets of various sorts have been
added, allowing listing of socket state from DDB without the use of GDB.

Certain non-MPSAFE subsystems have been removed or will be removed from
FreeBSD 7.0, including IPX over IP tunneling (not general IPX/SPX
support, just the tunneling over IP), KAME IPSEC (FAST_IPSEC is MPSAFE
and now now supports IPv6), i4b, netatm (two other ATM stacks are still
present), and ng_h4. Some of these features will be reintroduced in
FreeBSD 7.1, but by removing them now, we are able to remove the
NET_NEEDS_GIANT compatibility infrastructure that significant
complicates and obfuscates the socket and network stack code.

Other measurement and optimization projects continue; however, the 7.0
locking/synchronization work for the network stack is essentially
complete.

Open tasks:

1.  New work to parallelize the netisr thread (netisr2) as well as
    distribute UDP and TCP processing over multiple CPUs by connection,
    rather than just by input source as in 7.0, was presented at BSDCan.
    This work will be targeted at the 8-CURRENT branch.
2.  Complete netatm and NET_NEEDS_GIANT removal for 7.0.
3.  Complete MPSAFE locking of mld6 and nd6 IPv6 subsystems, which
    currently run under a global lock.

Network Stack Virtualization

Contact: Marko Zec <zec@fer.hr>

The network stack virtualization project aims at extending the FreeBSD
kernel to maintain multiple independent instances of networking state.
This will allow for complete networking independence between jails on a
system, including giving each jail its own firewall, virtual network
interfaces, rate limiting, routing tables, and IPSEC configuration.

I believe that the prototype, which is kept in sync with FreeBSD
-CURRENT, is now sufficiently stable for testing. It virtualizes the
basic INET and INET6 kernel structures and subsystems, including IPFW
and PF firewalls, and more. In the next month I plan to have the IPSEC
code fully virtualized, and refine and document the management APIs. The
short-term goal is to deliver production-grade kernel support for
virtualized networking for FreeBSD 7.0-RELEASE (as a snap-in kernel
replacement), while continuing to keep the code in sync with -CURRENT
for possible merging at a later date.

Wireless Networking

Contact: Sam Leffler <sam@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Andrew Thompson <thompsa@FreeBSD.org>

A major update of the 802.11 wireless support was committed. Changes
include advanced station mode facilities such as background scanning and
roaming, and support for 802.11n devices. In addition parts of the
Atheros' SuperG protocol extensions were added so that wireless clients
that communicate with Atheros-based access points can operate more
effectively. The changes to the infrastructure are also important
because they simplify future distribution of Virtual AP (VAP) support.

This work represents the effort of many people including Kip Macy,
Andrew Thompson, Sepherosa Ziehau, Max Laier, and Kevin Lo. Getting
these changes into the tree now ensures they will be present for the
lifetime of the 7.x branch.

The scanning and SuperG work were supported by Atheros. The
802.11n-related work was supported by Marvell.

Open tasks:

1.  Please test your wireless networking, especially during the 7.0 BETA
    and RC period.

configuration of the analysis to maximize the benefit from the tools.

At BSDCan2007, Coverity provided FreeBSD with a license for an
additional analysis tool called Extend, which allows writing custom
FreeBSD specific code checkers. David Maxwell presented training
material for interested FreeBSD developers. Some applications of custom
checkers have been considered, and more results will be forthcoming as
they are implemented and tested.

pf in HEAD (soon to be FreeBSD 7.0) has been updated to OpenBSD 4.1
bringing in a couple of new features:

-   ftp-proxy has been rewritten, and a tftp version, tftp-proxy, has
    been added
-   pf(4) now supports Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF) checks for
    simplified ingress filtering
-   The pflog(4) interface is now clonable. pf(4) can log to multiple
    pflog interfaces now, each rule can specify which pflog interface to
    log to
-   pflogd(8) can now be told which pflog interface to work with
-   pfctl(8) can now expire table entries
-   keep state is now the default for pf.conf(5) rules, as is the flags
    S/SA option on TCP connections. no state and flags any can be used
    to disable stateful filtering or TCP flags checking
-   The pfctl(8) ruleset optimiser can be enabled in pf.conf(5)
-   pf(4) anchors can now be loaded inline in the main pf.conf(5) and
    can be printed recursively
-   Allow pf(4) rules inside anchors to have their counters reset, and
    make counter read & reset an atomic operation

Some patches that went into OpenBSD after 4.1 and improve performance
significantly will be merged later.

Work to support pf and netgraph interaction is underway and will be
imported after 7.0. As all required ABI changes have been made during
the update, we will be able to MFC this work for 7.1 later on.

Contact: Colin Percival <cperciva@FreeBSD.org>

Both libarchive 2 and bsdtar 2 are now in -CURRENT and will be in 7.0.
Libarchive 1.9 and bsdtar 1.9 should be in 6-STABLE in time for 6.3.

libarchive 2 is much faster writing to disk than libarchive 1. It also
supports new formats, has several minor API/ABI corrections, is more
portable, and has many fewer bugs. Of special note is "libarchive_test",
a new program that exercises much of the libarchive functionality;
anyone interested in working on libarchive should become familiar with
this test suite. bsdtar 2 is less ambitious, but does have a number of
bug fixes and takes advantage of several new features in libarchive 2.

libarchive 1.9 is identical to libarchive 2 except it maintains the old
API/ABI. Similarly, bsdtar 1.9 is nearly identical to bsdtar 2, lacking
only a few features that would prevent it from being used with existing
libarchive 1 libraries.

Open tasks:

1.  Tim Kientzle has started work on a libarchive-based cpio
    implementation that should be ready for inclusion with FreeBSD 8.
2.  Volunteer needed: We want a libarchive-based pax to replace our
    out-of-date pax implementation.
3.  Volunteer needed: pkg_add should use libarchive instead of forking
    an external tar; this could eventually make it much faster.
4.  Volunteer(s) needed: libarchive should write more cpio variants
    (easy); libarchive should read and write mtree format (not
    difficult); libarchive should write GNUtar 1.0 format sparse tar
    entries (tricky); bsdtar should support --metadata=<archive> to read
    names and properties from one archive, with data from disk, to
    create a new archive (mtree support in libarchive would make this
    very useful); bsdtar should preserve sparseness when creating
    archives.
