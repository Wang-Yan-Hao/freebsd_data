The Ports Management Team is responsible for overseeing the overall
direction of the Ports Tree, building packages, and personnel matters.
Below is what happened in the last quarter.

Currently there are just over 34,400 ports in the Ports Tree. There are
currently 3,019 open ports PRs of which 746 are unassigned. The last
quarter saw 10,439 commits on the main branch by 151 committers and 745
commits on the 2023Q2 branch by 55 committers. Compared to the previous
quarter, this means a slight increase in the number of ports, a tiny
decrease in the number of open PRs, and a fair increase in the number of
ports commits.

During this quarter, we welcomed back Tom Judge (tj@) and said goodbye
to Steve Wills (swills@). Steve was also on portmgr. As part of the
portmgr lurker program, we welcomed Ronald Klop (ronald@), Renato
Botelho (garga@), and Matthias Andree (mandree@).

Portmgr has resumed work on introducing sub-packages into the Tree, but
various things still needs to be fleshed out.

On the software side, pkg was updated to 1.19.2, Firefox to 114.0.2,
Chromium to 114.0.5735.198, and KDE Gear to 23.04.2. During the last
quarter, antoine@ ran 23 exp-runs to test package updates, bump
CPU_MAXSIZE to 1024, fix armv7 failures for devel/cmake-core and add
--auto-features=enabled to USES=meson Lastly, the Ports Tree was updated
to support LLVM 16 and OpenSSL 3 in FreeBSD-CURRENT.
