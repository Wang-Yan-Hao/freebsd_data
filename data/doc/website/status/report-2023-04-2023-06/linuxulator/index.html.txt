Linux compatibility layer update

The goal of this project is to improve FreeBSD’s ability to execute
unmodified linux(4) binaries.

As of cbbac5609115, preserving of an fpu xsave state across signal
delivery on amd64 is implemented. That is made possible to run modern
golang with preemptive scheduler on.

The new facility to specify an alternate ABI root path was added to the
namei(9). Previously, to dynamically reroot lookups, every linux(4)
syscall where path names translation is needed required a bit of ugly
code and used kern_alternate_path() which does not properly resolved
symlinks with leading / in the target. For now a non-native ABI (i.e.,
linux(4)) uses one call to pwd_altroot() during exec-time into that ABI
to specify it’s root directory (e.g., /compat/ubuntu) and forget about
path names translation. That is made possible to chroot into the Ubuntu
compat without having to fix such symlinks by hand.

In total, over 10 bugs were fixed; glibc-2.37 tests suite reports less
than 70 failed tests.
