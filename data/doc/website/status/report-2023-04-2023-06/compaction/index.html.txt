Physical memory compaction for the FreeBSD kernel

Most modern CPU architectures offer performance boosts by supporting
pages that are larger than the standard page size. Unfortunately,
allocating such pages can fail due to a high degree of physical memory
fragmentation. This work implements physical memory compaction as a
means of actively reducing fragmentation in running systems. This work
is part of an ongoing Google Summer of Code project whose goal is to add
various physical memory anti-fragmentation measures to the virtual
memory subsystem.

Differential D40575 implements a well-known metric used for quantifying
the degree of physical memory fragmentation. Differential D40772
implements physical memory compaction and adds a daemon that monitors
the system and performs compaction when needed.

Planned future work includes designing an appropriate benchmarking
suite, running tests, and tweaking the code using feedback from reviews
and test results. This is still a work in progress, so any testing,
reviews, and feedback would be greatly appreciated.
