FreeBSD on EC2

Contact: Colin Percival <cperciva@FreeBSD.org>

FreeBSD is available on both x86 (Intel and AMD) and ARM64 (Graviton)
EC2 instances. Work continues to ensure that upcoming instance types
will be supported, including the recently announced M7a "EPYC"
instances, which should be supported in FreeBSD 14.0-RELEASE.

Weekly FreeBSD snapshots were recently changed from "UEFI" boot mode to
"UEFI Preferred" boot mode, allowing them to gain the boot performance
improvement offered by UEFI while still supporting "bare metal" and
"previous generation" instance types which are not compatible with UEFI.
This change will be present in FreeBSD 14.0-RELEASE.

The EC2 boot scripts were recently updated to support IMDSv2. This
change will be present in FreeBSD 14.0-RELEASE.

If users of FreeBSD 13.2 require any of these updates, the author can
provide FreeBSD "13.2-RELEASE plus updates" AMIs.

This work is supported by Colin’s FreeBSD/EC2 Patreon.
