OpenStack on FreeBSD

This project aims to port key OpenStack components such as keystone,
nova, neutron, etc., so that FreeBSD can function as an OpenStack host.

In 2023 Q2, we start porting nova-novncproxy and nova-serialproxy to
increase the ways to access the instance console. To lower the threshold
for people who want to give it a try on the project, we also migrate our
development environment from a physical machine to a virtual one. But
there is still a problem running bhyve VMs on top of Linux KVM. A
detailed writeup for the issue can be found here. Other achievements
include:

-   Sorting out network connectivity issues inside the instances

-   Able to spawn multiple instances

-   Porting from Python 3.8 to 3.9

In the next quarter, we will continue working on the console proxy
services to make the overall workflow more fluent.

The step-by-step documents for constructing a POC site can also be found
in the docs repository. The patched version of each OpenStack component
is under the same GitHub organization.

People interested in helping with the project can first help check the
documentation by following the installation guide. Feedback and help are
always welcome.
