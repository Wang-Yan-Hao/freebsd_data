Upstream has released GCC 13. As announced in the past status report, I
plan to attempt an update of GCC_DEFAULT right from the first GCC 13
release, thus much of this quarter work has been in preparation of this.

With the release of GCC 13.1 (first GCC 13 release: I remind that GCC
counts minor version releases starting from 1), two new ports have been
created in the ports tree:

-   lang/gcc13, tracking GCC 13 releases;

-   lang/gcc14-devel, tracking snapshots from the new GCC 14 upstream
    branch.

The *-devel ports

A few significant changes have been made on the *-devel ports, which
will be forwarded to the production ports together with more changes
(see below):

-   enable support for .init_array and .fini_array, which FreeBSD
    supports since commit 83aa9cc00c2d;

-   switch back to STANDARD_BOOTSTRAP on i386, amd64 and aarch64 as
    default option instead of LTO_BOOTSTRAP: LTO bootstrap produces too
    many failures on the package builders for those architectures. Users
    wanting to use LTO_BOOTSTRAP can still enable the option manually.

The production ports

Upstream has released GCC 13, for which the new port lang/gcc13 has been
created. GCC 11 and GCC 12 have been updated upstream and a new release
of GCC 10 is planned. All corresponding ports now need to be updated.

To ease the work of both ports maintainers and users, I plan to test and
update together all the following changes:

-   updates of lang/gcc10, lang/gcc11, lang/gcc12;

-   update of GCC_DEFAULT to 13;

-   enabling of .init_array and .fini_array on the production ports;

-   switching back from LTO_BOOTSTRAP to STANDARD_BOOTSTRAP on the
    production ports.

This will provide the following advantages:

-   more testing with less exp-runs;

-   fewer builds for ports users.
