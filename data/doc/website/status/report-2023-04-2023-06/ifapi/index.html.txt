Network Interface API (IfAPI)

Original project page URL: link:https://wiki.freebsd.org/projects/ifnet

Contact: Justin Hibbits <jhibbits@FreeBSD.org>

Started back in 2014, the IfAPI (formerly DrvAPI) goal is to hide the
ifnet(9) structure from network drivers. Instead, all accesses to
members will go through accessor functions. This allows the network
stack to be changed without recompiling drivers, as well as potentially
allowing a single driver to support multiple versions of FreeBSD.

As of now this goal has been achieved in the base system, but several
ports need to be updated to use the IfAPI. There is a tool to automate
most of the conversion, in tools/ifnet/convert_ifapi.sh. Documentation
is also forthcoming, but could use help on that. ifnet(9) needs a lot of
cleanup, as even some information in it currently is out of date.
