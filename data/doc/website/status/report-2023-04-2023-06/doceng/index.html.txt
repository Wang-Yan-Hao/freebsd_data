Contact: FreeBSD Doceng Team <doceng@FreeBSD.org>

The doceng@ team is a body to handle some of the meta-project issues
associated with the FreeBSD Documentation Project; for more information,
see FreeBSD Doceng Team Charter.

During the last quarter:

-   fernape@ has been appointed as a new Doceng team member.

-   The www/gohugo port maintainership has been transferred to doceng@
    since it is a critical part of our documentation infrastructure.
    This was agreed with the former maintainer.

-   Improvements to the translation workflow (described in the following
    sections).

FDP Primer:

-   A new chapter focusing on Weblate has been recently added to the
    FreeBSD Documentation Project Primer for New Contributors book. This
    comprehensive chapter provides step-by-step guidance on joining the
    FreeBSD translators team, both for translating online on Weblate and
    offline. It offers valuable insights and practical suggestions for
    efficient translation, proofreading, and testing processes.
    Furthermore, this chapter equips contributors with the necessary
    knowledge to formally submit their translations to the documentation
    repository, ensuring a seamless integration of their work.

The FreeBSD Weblate instance now operates on a dedicated server,

providing this hardware upgrade.
