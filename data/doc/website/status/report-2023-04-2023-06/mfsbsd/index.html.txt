Integrate mfsBSD into the release building tools

What is mfsBSD?

"mfsBSD is a toolset to create small-sized but full-featured mfsroot
based distributions of FreeBSD that store all files in memory (MFS)
[Memory File System] and load from hard drive, usb storage device or
optical media. It can be used for a variety of purposes, including
diskless systems, recovery partitions and remotely overwriting other
operating systems."

Martin Matuska is both the author of the mfsBSD white paper and the
maintainer of the mfsBSD repository.

Purpose of this project

This project creates an additional target of the weekly snapshots of
-current and -stable versions of mfsBSD images in the src/release
makefile. Currently, only the release versions of mfsBSD images are
produced, which means they tend to get out of sync with the tools in
base. This project aims to address that problem.

Location of this project

This project is a GSoC 2023 (Google Summer of Code) project, under
mentorship from Juraj Lutter and Joseph Mingrone.

As a GSoC project, the official coding period is between May 29, 2023
and August 28, 2023. As a humble beginner in the open-source community,
the author of this project welcomes all comments / suggestions / PR’s to
the project repository, which is where all the code for this project
will be located for the duration of the official GSoC coding period.

Sponsor: Google, Inc. (GSoC 2023)
