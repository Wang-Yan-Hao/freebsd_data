MITRE Caldera on FreeBSD

Links:
MITRE Caldera URL: https://www.caldera.com/
Red Canary URL: http://www.redcanary.com/

Contact: José Alonso Cárdenas Márquez <acm@FreeBSD.org>

MITRE Caldera is a cybersecurity platform designed to easily automate
adversary emulation, assist manual red teams, and automate incident
response.

It is built on the MITRE ATT&CK framework and is an active research
project at MITRE.

MITRE Caldera (security/caldera) was added to the ports tree in April
2023. This port includes support for the Atomic Red Team Project used by
the MITRE Caldera atomic plugin.

The main goal of this work is enhancing visibility of FreeBSD as a
useful platform for information security or cybersecurity.

Additionally, you can test a MITRE Caldera infrastructure easily using
https://github.com/alonsobsd/caldera-makejail or
https://github.com/AppJail-makejails/caldera from AppJail. AppJail is a
good tool for managing jail containers from the command line.

People interested in helping with the project are welcome.

Current version: 4.2.0

TODO

-   Add Caldera testing infrastructure makejail

-   Add FreeBSD to platforms officially supported by MITRE Caldera, see
    https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2752

-   Add FreeBSD to platforms officially supported by Red Canary, see
    https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/pull/2450
