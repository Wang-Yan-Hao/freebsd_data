SIMD enhancements for amd64

Contact: Robert Clausecker <clausecker@FreeBSD.org>

SIMD instruction set extensions such as SSE, AVX, and NEON are
ubiquitous on modern computers and offer performance advantages for many
applications. The goal of this project is to provide SIMD-enhanced
versions of common libc functions (mostly those described in string(3)),
speeding up most C programs.

For each function optimised, up to four implementations will be
provided:

-   a scalar implementation optimised for amd64, but without any SIMD
    usage,

-   a baseline implementation using SSE and SSE2 or alternatively an
    x86-64-v2 implementation using all SSE extensions up to SSE4.2,

-   an x86-64-v3 implementation using AVX and AVX2, and

-   an x86-64-v4 implementation using AVX-512F/BW/CD/DQ.

Users will be able to select which level of SIMD enhancements to use by
setting the AMD64_ARCHLEVEL environment variable.

While the current project only concerns amd64, the work may be expanded
to other architectures like arm64 in the future.
