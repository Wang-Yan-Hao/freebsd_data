CheriBSD extends FreeBSD to implement memory protection and software
compartmentalization features supported by the CHERI instruction-set
extensions. There are two active architectural implementations of the
CHERI protection model: CHERI-RISC-V and Arm’s Morello. A sketch of
CHERI-x86 is also under development. CheriBSD is a research operating
system with a stable baseline implementation into which various new
research features have been, or are currently being, merged.

We have published the 22.12 release of CheriBSD including:

-   A general update of the baseline FreeBSD OS to August 2022.

-   Memory-safe adaptation of Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) and
    Panfrost device driver, which enable a Morello-based desktop system
    using on-board GPU and HDMI. These drivers may be used with hybrid
    or pure-capability kernels.

-   An initial set of graphics and desktop CheriABI software packages
    such as Wayland and portions of KDE to get you up and running with a
    memory-safe desktop environment. These components remain under
    active development, and we anticipate continuing package updates
    after the CheriBSD release.

-   An early research prototype of library-based compartmentalization,
    which implements an alternative run-time linker running shared
    objects in libraries. This implementation is very much a
    work-in-progress, and is provided to enable research at other
    collaborator institutions needing easy access to the prototype. It
    is neither complete nor intended to be secure.

-   Improved pluggability of experimental heap temporal memory-safety
    support, which is not yet merged into the main development branch,
    but will now be easier to use by downloading an alternative kernel
    and heap allocator libraries provided by Microsoft.

-   An updated version of GDB with support for Morello instructions and
    inspecting memory tags.

-   Alpha support for ZFS file systems including support for boot
    environments.
