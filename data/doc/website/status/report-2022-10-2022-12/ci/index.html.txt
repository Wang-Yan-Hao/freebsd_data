The FreeBSD CI team maintains the continuous integration system of the
FreeBSD project. The CI system checks the committed changes can be
successfully built, then performs various tests and analysis over the
newly built results. The artifacts from those builds are archived in the
artifact server for further testing and debugging needs. The CI team
members examine the failing builds and unstable tests and work with the
experts in that area to fix the code or adjust test infrastructure.

During the fourth quarter of 2022, we continued working with the
contributors and developers in the project to fulfill their testing
needs and also keep collaborating with external projects and companies
to improve their products and FreeBSD.

Important completed tasks:

-   FreeBSD-main-amd64-gcc9_build now sends failing reports to the
    committers whose commits may be related.

-   FreeBSD-main-amd64-gcc12_build has been added.

-   FreeBSD-main-powerpc64-images now also builds bootable APM disk
    image for Apple G5 baremetal and QEMU -M mac99 (by alfredo@)

Work in progress tasks:

-   Designing and implementing pre-commit CI building and testing (to
    support the workflow working group)

-   Designing and implementing use of CI cluster to build release
    artifacts as release engineering does

-   Simplifying CI/test environment setting up for contributors and
    developers

-   Setting up the CI stage environment and putting the experimental
    jobs on it

-   Organizing the scripts in freebsd-ci repository to prepare for
    merging to src repository

-   Improving the hardware test lab and adding more hardware for testing

Open or queued tasks:

-   Collecting and sorting CI tasks and ideas

-   Setting up public network access for the VM guest running tests

-   Implementing use of bare-metal hardware to run test suites

-   Adding drm ports building tests against -CURRENT

-   Planning to run ztest tests

-   Adding more external toolchain related jobs

-   Helping more software get FreeBSD support in its CI pipeline (Wiki
    pages: 3rdPartySoftwareCI, HostedCI)

-   Working with hosted CI providers to have better FreeBSD support

Please see freebsd-testing@ related tickets for more WIP information,
and don’t hesitate to join the effort!
