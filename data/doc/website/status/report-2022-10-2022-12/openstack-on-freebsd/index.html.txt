OpenStack on FreeBSD

OpenStack is an open-source cloud operating system for different
resource types like virtual and bare-metal machines. Users can spawn
FreeBSD instances on the open cloud platform, but it is not currently
possible to run the OpenStack control plane on FreeBSD hosts. This
project aims to port key OpenStack components so that FreeBSD can
function as an OpenStack host.

In 2022 Q4, we have almost completed the porting work regarding the
crucial OpenStack components. Most of the components/services composing
an essential OpenStack cluster are now able to run on FreeBSD hosts,
including:

-   Keystone (identity service)

    -   keystone server

-   Glance (image service)

    -   glance-api

-   Placement (resource tracking and inventory service)

    -   placement-api

-   Neutron (networking service)

    -   neutron-server

    -   neutron-metadata-agent

    -   neutron-dhcp-agent

    -   neutron-openvswitch-agent

-   Nova (compute service)

    -   nova-api

    -   nova-conductor

    -   nova-scheduler

    -   nova-compute

    -   nova-novncproxy

The step-by-step documents for constructing a POC can be found in the
docs repository.

In its design, most of the OpenStack components provide an abstraction
layer for the underlying implementations. For nova, we choose the
combination of the libvirt driver with the bhyve virtualization type
enabled. For neutron, it is the openvswitch mechanism driver. We solved
several runtime dependencies and porting issues against the Libvirt,
bhyve, and Open vSwitch combinations with minimal effort. We still have
lots of work to undertake to make the changes back to OpenStack
upstream.

TODOs include:

-   Develop a proper alternative execution path in the oslo_privsep
    module for FreeBSD environments

-   Develop a new virtualization type, bhyve, for nova-compute’s libvirt
    driver

-   Develop the IP library for FreeBSD under neutron/agent/freebsd

In the first few weeks of 2023, we will focus on breaking through the
last mile of the instance spawn path and wrapping up the documentation
regarding POC site construction. We will also try rebasing the porting
work to the master branch of OpenStack (now Xena).

People interested in helping with the project can first help check the
documentation by following the installation guide.
