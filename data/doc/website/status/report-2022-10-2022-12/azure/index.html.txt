In this quarter, the 12.4-RELEASE image has been published to Azure
Marketplace.

Work in progress tasks:

-   Automating the image building and publishing process and merge to
    src/release/.

-   Building and publishing ZFS-based images to Azure Marketplace

    -   All the required codes are merged to main branch, and can create
        ZFS-based images by specifying VMFS=zfs.

    -   Need to make the build process more automatic and collaborating
        with release engineering to start generating snapshots.

-   Building and publishing Hyper-V gen2 VM images to Azure Marketplace

    -   Blocked by https://bugs.freebsd.org/264267
