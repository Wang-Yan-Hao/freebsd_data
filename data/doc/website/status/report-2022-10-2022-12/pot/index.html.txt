Containers and FreeBSD: Pot, Potluck and Potman

Pot is a jail management tool that also supports orchestration through
Nomad.

During the last quarter, pot 0.15.4 was released. It again contains a
number of improvements like signing pot images as well as many bug
fixes. Also, we welcome two new pot contributors: @zilti and @reezer.

Additionally, there is a new Ansible pot collection available.

Potluck aims to be to FreeBSD and pot what Dockerhub is to Linux and
Docker: a repository of pot flavours and complete container images for
usage with pot and in many cases Nomad.

As you can see, we had a busy quarter again, this time including
improvements to the Nextcloud as well as Jitsi images.

Furthermore, we landed pot-based FreeBSD support for sccache-dist server
(the server component for distributed compilation of rust and C++ using
sccache) and it will be part of the upcoming sccache 0.4.0, see
mozilla/sccache#1184. Once released, this will become available through
devel/sccache.

This means one can build rust projects on FreeBSD targeting a cluster of
machines, something that could potentially be integrated into poudriere
as well.

Last but not least, Luca’s EuroBSDCon 2022 talk is now available on
YouTube.

As always, feedback and patches are welcome.
