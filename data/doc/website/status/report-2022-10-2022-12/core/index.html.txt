FreeBSD Core Team

Contact: FreeBSD Core Team <core@FreeBSD.org>

The FreeBSD Core Team is the governing body of FreeBSD.

Items

Core Team Charter

A delegation of the current core team is working together with some
members of the previous Core Team to draft a core team charter. There
was a face-to-face meeting in the US on December 3 - 4 to discuss the
new charter. The delegation will present to the rest of the core team
and discuss the details in the first quarter of 2023. The same
delegation also had a meeting with the FreeBSD Foundation board on
December 5th to discuss the collaboration details.

Experimental Matrix IM solution

The core team is working on evaluating Matrix as an instant messaging
tool for the project. This will make the project’s communication
channels less dependant on third parties. The service will be made
available to the FreeBSD community to test and evaluate its validity at
a later date.
