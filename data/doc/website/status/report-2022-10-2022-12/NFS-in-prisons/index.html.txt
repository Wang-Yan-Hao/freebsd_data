Enable the NFS server to run in a vnet prison

Links:
Source patch for main URL:
https://people.freebsd.org/~rmacklem/vnet.patch
Simple Setup Doc URL:

Contact: Rick Macklem <rmacklem@freebsd.org>

Several users of FreeBSD identified a need to run the NFS server inside
a vnet prison. This turned into a small project, where I now have a
patch that does this. It is currently available at the above link for
testing or on Phabricator as D37519. Without this patch, the NFS server
cannot be run in a prison.

Not included in the above patch is the ability to run the
rpc.tlsservd(8) and nfsuserd(8) daemons within the vnet prison. I do now
have patches that allow these daemons to run in the vnet prison along
with mountd(8) and nfsd(8), but I would like to get the above patch into
main before adding support for rpc.tlsservd(8) or nfsuserd(8).

At this time, the code needs reviewing and testing. Hopefully this can
be completed in the next few weeks, so that the patch can be committed
to main and possibly also MFC’d to stable/13.

To do

-   Testing the above patch.

-   Reviewing the above patch.

-   Doing the same for the rpc.tlsservd(8) and nfsuserd(8) patches.
