Pantheon desktop on FreeBSD

Development repository URL:
https://codeberg.org/olivierd/freebsd-ports-elementary

Contact: Olivier Duchateau <duchateau.olivier@gmail.com>

The Pantheon desktop environment is designed for elementary OS. It
builds on GNOME technologies (such as Mutter, GTK 3 and 4) and it is
written in Vala. The goal is to have a new desktop for users.

13.1-RELEASE or higher is required, because several core components
depend on deskutils/xdg-desktop-portal.

The repository contains Mk/Uses framework elementary.mk, official
applications, and curated ports which depend on x11-toolkits/granite.

Since the previous report, we have been updating its related ports,
especially:

-   deskutils/elementary-calendar update to 6.1.2

-   deskutils/iconbrowser

-   graphics/elementary-photos

-   math/elementary-calculator

-   multimedia/elementary-videos

-   x11/elementary-terminal

-   x11-themes/gnome-icons-elementary

-   x11-toolkits/granite7.

Power manager plugins for top panel (wingpanel) and control center
(switchboard) are finished.

A new switchboard plugin is also available,
net/switchboard-plug-sharing. Ported Rygel, GNOME UPnP/DLNA services.

Submitted other patches for low level libraries such as:

-   print/cups-pk-helper update to 0.2.7 required by
    print/switchboard-plus-printers

-   devel/libgee update to 0.20.6 heavily used by the desktop

-   sysutils/polkit update to 122 (D37137)

-   sysutils/accountsservice update to 22.08.8 (D37679).

Open tasks

-   Improve documentation.

-   Continue to work on user settings.
