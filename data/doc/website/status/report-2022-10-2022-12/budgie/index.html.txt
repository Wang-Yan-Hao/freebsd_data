Budgie desktop on FreeBSD

Contact: Olivier Duchateau <duchateau.olivier@gmail.com>

Budgie initially developed as the default desktop environment for the
former Evolve OS. Since the 10.6.x releases, improvements have been made
to be "agnostic".

It is built on top of GNOME technologies such as GTK >= 3, GLib, Mutter,
libpeas.

The goal is to have a new desktop for end users. I have submitted 2
reviews (D37224 and D37286 for The FreeBSD Porter’s Handbook) so
committers can import it.

These reviews include:

-   Mk/Uses framework budgie.mk

-   new virtual category (budgie)

-   6 applications

-   icon theme x11-themes/tela-icon-theme.

During this quarter, I have also submitted several patches (related to
this desktop) especially:

-   x11/gnome-terminal update to 3.44.2 bug #267928

-   x11-wm/mutter update to 42.6 bug #267899

-   x11-toolkits/libwnck3 update to 40.1 bug #267898.

These bugs are also still open:

-   devel/libpeas bug #267420

-   sysutils/gnome-settings-daemon bug #265107.
