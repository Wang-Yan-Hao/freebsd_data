This project aims at providing a very basic screen reader usable in
console mode (without a GUI) for FreeBSD. This is an important first
step for system administrators using speech to access computers, who
previously would have needed a second computer running a terminal
emulator to install or configure a FreeBSD server or character-based
desktop computer.

The third and fourth quarters of 2022 saw basic design and some feature
testing which looks promising, and a detailed call for testing with
installation procedure posted.

This project needs help with the following:

-   Code reviewing

-   Usability testing

-   Integrating with the FreeBSD installer.

Sponsor: NVIDIA Networking (for the kernel development part)
