Pytest support for the FreeBSD testing framework

Native pytest support for atf(7) enhances the capabilities of the
FreeBSD test suite.

Pytest simplifies test writing by reducing the amount of boiler-plate
code. It offers several advantages over the existing atf-c and atf-shell
bindings. One of the most important ones is the test parametrization,
which allows improving coverage with writing nearly no code. The other
is a rich assert system, offering detailed errors description. Python
atf(7) support comes with a number of libraries that abstract a number
of commonly-used tasks. For example, running a test within a VNET jail
with epair(4) requires adding a single line of code. Such helpers are
especially handy in the networking area, where tests with complex VNET
setups are not uncommon.

Current status

Python support has been committed to HEAD. Currently, ~80 tests use the
Python framework and the number is rising. Example tests have been
committed to show the handling of the typical cases.

Next steps

-   Work on increasing the adoption of the framework

-   Rewrite some of the older Python/shell tests in the netinet[6] to
    pytest (help is appreciated)
