KDE on FreeBSD

Contact: Adriaan de Groot <kde@FreeBSD.org>

The KDE on FreeBSD project packages CMake, Qt, and software from the KDE
Community, for the FreeBSD ports tree. The software includes a full
desktop environment called KDE Plasma (for both X11 and Wayland) and
hundreds of applications that can be used on any FreeBSD machine.

The KDE team (kde@) is part of desktop@ and x11@, building the software
stack to make FreeBSD beautiful and usable as a daily-driver
graphics-based desktop machine. The notes below describe mostly ports
for KDE, but also include items that are important for the entire
desktop stack.

Infrastructure

-   CMake ports now share a single version number. Various build-flags
    have been updated for FreeBSD ports builds: under some
    circumstances, release-flags were ignored and debug-flags applied,
    which is undesirable. CMake now also refuses to fetch remote sources
    during a ports build.

-   Qt versions are now Qt 5.15.7 (used by KDE) and Qt 6.4.1. Some
    applications in the ports tree are now "flavored" for Qt5 and Qt6.

KDE Stack

KDE Gear releases happen every quarter, KDE Plasma updates once a month,
and KDE Frameworks have a new release every month as well. These (large)
updates land shortly after their upstream release and are not listed
separately.

-   KDE Frameworks 5 is now at version 5.101 (latest monthly release
    from December 2022). This is likely one of the last "Frameworks 5"
    releases, as the next major series comes closer.

-   KDE Gear is now version 22.12.0 (update for December 2022).

-   KDE Plasma is now version 5.24.7 (update for October 2022).

Note that KDE Plasma 5.25 has been released upstream, but is still
waiting on fixes before it can land in the ports tree (for example, this
KActivityManager bug in KDE’s bug-tracker).

Related Ports

-   graphics/krita is now version 5.1.3.

-   graphics/poppler was updated multiple times, now at version 22.11.
    It supports Qt5 and Qt6 through separate ports.

-   net-im/telegram-desktop was now supports Qt5 and Qt6 through
    flavors.
