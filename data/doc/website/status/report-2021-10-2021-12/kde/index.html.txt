KDE on FreeBSD

Contact: Adriaan de Groot <kde@FreeBSD.org>

The KDE on FreeBSD project aims to package the software from the KDE
Community, along with dependencies and related software, for the FreeBSD
ports tree. That includes a full desktop environment called KDE Plasma
(for both X11 and Wayland) and hundreds of applications that can be used
on any FreeBSD machine.

The KDE team (kde@) is part of desktop@ and x11@ as well, building the
software stack to make FreeBSD beautiful and usable as a daily-driver
graphics-based desktop machine.

-   Just two CMake updates this quarter, ending up with CMake 3.22.1.
    Some more patches have landed upstream, and CMake is soon to switch
    to share/man for manpages on FreeBSD. When it does, there will be
    plenty of pkg-plist churn.

-   Monthly releases of KDE Frameworks, KDE Plasma, and KDE Gear kept
    the exp-runs going. kde@ would like to thank Antoine for overseeing
    our many exp-run requests. We are now at KDE Frameworks 5.89 (latest
    release as of December 2021), KDE Plasma Desktop 5.23.4 and KDE Gear
    21.12.

-   Qt 5 is not receiving any open source updates from the Qt Company,
    but the KDE Community maintains its own set of patches that backport
    many fixes from Qt 6. Work is underway to import the KDE patch
    collection.

-   Qt 6 remains tantalizingly close. There hasn’t been real progress on
    the crash-on-exit problem, though.

-   deskutils/kalendar is a relatively new port that uses KDE
    technologies for a desktop (appointments) calendar.

-   deskutils/latte-dock, an alternative launcher for KDE Plasma (and
    other environments) was updated to each of its bugfix releases.

-   devel/qbs and devel/qtcreator were updated. Qbs (or "Qt Build
    System") is a declarative build system styled along the lines of
    declarative QML programs. (Note that Qbs is not used by Qt itself).

-   graphics/digikam was updated to the latest release and now supports
    both ImageMagick 6 and ImageMagick 7. Speaking of which, a new
    USES=magick was introduced to simplify ports that depend in
    ImageMagick.

-   graphics/ksnip, one of several screenshot-applications for KDE
    Plasma (and other environments) had a lots-of-bugfixes update.

-   graphics/skanpage is a new port that scans multiple pages and
    produces a PDF of the whole.

-   multimedia/qt5-multimedia now ignores gstreamer-gl (rather than
    implicitly building with it as a dependency if it is installed a
    build time).

-   net-im/ruqola is a Rocket Chat client, updated to the latest
    release.

-   security/qtkeychain has a new release.

Elsewhere in the software stack, kde@ also maintains ports that support
the desktop in general. Some highlights are:

-   devel/libphonenumber keeps chasing changes to the world’s phone
    numbers (the FreeBSD foundation can be reached at +1.720.207.5142).

-   graphics/poppler updated this much-used PDF-rendering library.

-   multimedia/pipewire, the audio-and-video successor to pulseaudio,
    was updated and now supports SSL as well.

-   net/py-pytradfri got several updates so you can control your lights
    from FreeBSD.

-   print/freetype2 was updated to the latest release; relatedly, there
    was am update to x11-toolkits/libXft.

-   print/harfbuzz, the text-shaping library, was updated for more font
    type support.

-   sysutils/bsdisks is an implementation of DBus interfaces for
    examining disks (drives, partitions, etc.). It is also used for
    removable-disk notifications.

-   x11-themes/adwaita-qt, which connects the adwaita theme engine to
    Qt-based applications, was updated.
