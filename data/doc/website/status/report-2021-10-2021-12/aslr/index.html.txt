Enable ASLR by default for 64-bit executables

Contact: Dawid Gorecki <dgr@semihalf.com>
Contact: Marcin Wojtas <mw@semihalf.com>

Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) is an exploit mitigation
technique implemented in the majority of modern operating systems. It
involves randomly positioning the base address of an executable and the
position of libraries, heap, and stack, in a process’s address space.
Although over the years ASLR proved to not guarantee full OS security on
its own, this mechanism can make exploitation more difficult.

The Semihalf team made an effort to switch on the address map
randomization for PIE (Position Independent Executables) & non-PIE
64-bit binaries. Once the patch was merged to HEAD, the ASLR feature
became enabled for all 64-bit architectures.

Additionally, the mentioned change disabled SBRK, in order to allow
utilization of the bss grow region for mappings. It has no effect
without ASLR, so it was applied to all architectures.

TODO:

-   Improve stackgap feature implementation.

-   MFC to stable/13 branch.
