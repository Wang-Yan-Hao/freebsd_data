What is helloSystem?

helloSystem is FreeBSD preconfigured as a desktop operating system with
a focus on simplicity, elegance, and usability. Its design follows the
“Less, but better” philosophy.

Q4 2021 Status

-   Version 0.7.0 of helloSystem has been published including many
    contributed features and bugfixes

    -   helloSystem is now based on FreeBSD 13.0-RELEASE

    -   Completely reworked Live ISO architecture, resulting in 1/3rd
        boot time and under 800 MB size (fits a CD-ROM)

    -   Developer Tools are now a separate download

    -   Disk Images are increasingly used throughout the system, such as
        for application distribution and Linuxulator userland deployment

    -   Many new features and GUI utilities to make the desktop more
        usable for "mere mortals" without the need for a terminal

Installable Live ISO images and a full changelog are available at
https://github.com/helloSystem/ISO/releases/tag/r0.7.0
