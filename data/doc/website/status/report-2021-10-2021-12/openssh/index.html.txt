Base System OpenSSH Update

Announcement to freebsd-security@ URL:
https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-security/2021-September/010473.html

Contact: Ed Maste <emaste@freebsd.org>

OpenSSH, a suite of remote login and file transfer tools, was updated
from version 8.7p1 to 8.8p1 in the FreeBSD base system.

NOTE: OpenSSH 8.8p1 disables the ssh-rsa signature scheme by default.
For more information please see the Important note for future FreeBSD
base system OpenSSH update mailing list post.

OpenSSH supports FIDO/U2F devices, and support is now enabled in the
base system.

Next steps include integrating U2F key devd rules into the base system,
and merging the updated OpenSSH and FIDO/U2F support to stable branches.
