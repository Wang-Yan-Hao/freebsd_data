The Ports Management Team is responsible for overseeing the overall
direction of the Ports Tree, building packages, and personnel matters.
Below is what happened in the last quarter.

We currently have 46,700 ports in the Ports Collection according to
FreshPorts. There are currently 2,666 open ports PRs of which 611 are
unassigned. This quarter saw 9,535 commits from 166 committers on the
main branch and 644 commits from 62 committers on the quarterly branch.
Compared to last quarter, this means a slight drop in the number of
commits although more committers were active, and a slight increase in
the number of open PRs.

During the last quarter, we welcomed Dries Michiels (driesm@) and said
goodbye to kuriyama@ and fjoe@. There was also a change in portmgr:
adamw@ stepped down after five years of service and tcberner@ is now a
full member of portmgr@.

Three new USES were introduced:

-   magick to handle dependencies on ImageMagick

-   nodejs to provide support for NodeJS (with a new default version
    NODEJS=lts)

-   trigger to handle pkg triggers using the TRIGGERS variable

The default version of PGSQL switched to 13. Furthermore, INSTALLS_ICONS
has been replaced by a trigger on gtk-update-icon-cache and the macro is
no longer functional.

As always, there were some updates to "big" packages: pkg was updated to
1.17.5, Chromium to 94.0.4606.81_3, and Firefox to 95.0.2_1,2. Ruby
3.1.0 and Python 3.11 are now available for use by users and other
ports.
