Pot is a jail management tool that also supports orchestration through
Nomad.

In the last quarter, a new release 0.14.0 with a number of fixes and
features like the new copy-in-flv command was made available.

Potluck aims to be to FreeBSD and Pot what Dockerhub is to Linux and
Docker: a repository of Pot flavours and complete container images for
usage with Pot and in many cases Nomad.

Here we again had a busy quarter. All images have been rebuilt for
FreeBSD 12.3 and pot 0.13.0.
Also the images that can be used to build a virtual data center like
Nomad, Consul and Vault have received a lot more tender love and care
and are meanwhile in pre-production use on a cluster at a fintech.
Not all these changes have yet been committed to the github repository
though, this is planned for the next quarter. Additionally, new images
like multi-master OpenLDAP have been added, too.

Potman aims to simplify building Pot images with Vagrant and VirtualBox
based on the Potluck approach, e.g. as part of a DevOps workflow for
software development including testing and publishing them to a
repository.

Here we have not yet made a lot of headway with our plan to utilise
Potman in the Potluck library build process but this is still on our
TODO-list, like improving the documentation for using the Virtual DC
images from the Potluck library.

As always, feedback and patches are welcome.
