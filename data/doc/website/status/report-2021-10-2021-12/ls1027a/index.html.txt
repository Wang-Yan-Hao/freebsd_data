The Semihalf team has been working on adding the FreeBSD support for the
NXP LS1028A SoC, as well as its GPU-less variant (NXP LS1027A).

NXP LS1028A/LS1027A SoC is a dual-core 64-bit ARMv8 Cortex-A72
application processor with high-speed peripherals such as 2
Time-Sensitive Networking-capable (TSN) Ethernet controllers, quad-port
TSN-enabled switch, PCIE, SD/MMC, USB3.0 and others.

The original support was extended in the following way:

-   ENETC Ethernet driver

    -   Add support for PHY interrupts

    -   Fix VID/mcast address hash calculation

    -   Serialize MDIO transactions

    -   Allow loading driver as a module

-   Improvements in the FSL SDHCI driver

    -   Add support for HS200/HS400 modes

    -   Add full support for software reset

    -   Provide more accurate clk calculation

    -   Implement pulse width detection errata

    -   Fix vccq reconfiguration

-   FLEX SPI NOR controller driver

-   Additional features:

    -   TMP461 thermal sensor driver

    -   PCF85063 RTC driver driver

    -   TCA6408 I2C GPIO expander driver

TODO:

-   Improve MMC HS200/HS400 support for other SoCs using the FSL SDHCI
    controller.
