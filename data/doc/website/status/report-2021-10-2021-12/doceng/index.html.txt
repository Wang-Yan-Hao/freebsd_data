Contact: FreeBSD Doceng Team <doceng@FreeBSD.org>

The doceng@ team is a body to handle some of the meta-project issues
associated with the FreeBSD Documentation Project; for more information,
see FreeBSD Doceng Team Charter.

No new documentation commit bit was granted during the last quarter, and
only one commit bit was safe kept.

Several tasks were completed related to the doc tree during the last
quarter:

-   A COPYRIGHT file was added in the root directory of the doc
    repository. The license was also updated to reflect the current
    toolchain the project is using now.

-   Cleanup of Mailman information in the doc tree. Following mailing
    lists migration from Mailman to Mlmmj, very old mailing lists were
    removed; most of the work was made on English documents.

-   Tag FreeBSD docset for 12.3-RELEASE.

-   Update all ports/packages misc/freebsd-doc-*.

-   Move articles/contributors/contrib-* files to the doc shared
    directory.

-   Add option in documentation Makefile to archive/compress
    Documentation/HTML offline files, a necessary step before updating
    https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/. This was after a discussion with
    clusteradm@ to update the offline assets (HTML/PDF).

-   Add experimental support for EPUB output (books/articles).

-   Talking with clusteradm@ to improve the performance of
    https://www.freebsd.org and https://docs.freebsd.org.
