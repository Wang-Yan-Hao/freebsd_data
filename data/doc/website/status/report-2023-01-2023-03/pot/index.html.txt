Containers and FreeBSD: Pot, Potluck and Potman

Pot organization on GitHub URL: https://github.com/bsdpot

Pot is a jail management tool that also supports orchestration through
Nomad.

During the last quarter, pot received a number of minor fixes but no new
version has been released yet.

Potluck aims to be to FreeBSD and pot what Dockerhub is to Linux and
Docker: a repository of pot flavours and complete container images for
usage with pot and in many cases Nomad.

All Potluck images have been rebuilt to include the latest FreeBSD
security advisories, a new Smokeping network latency monitoring image
has been added, again a lot of work went into the Jitsi image, which
unfortunately still seems to have some reliability issues.

Also, two new blog posts are available showing how easy it is to use
Potluck images, one explaining how to set up Nextcloud with Minio as
object storage and Prometheus for monitoring, one showing how to run
your own Matrix Synapse server using OpenLDAP for access management.

As always, feedback and patches are welcome.
