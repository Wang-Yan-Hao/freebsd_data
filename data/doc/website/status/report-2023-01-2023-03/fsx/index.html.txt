FSX

The venerable FSX (File System eXerciser) tool, first written at Apple
Computer in the nineties, has been a part of FreeBSD since 5.0. It
stress tests file systems with a stream of randomly generated
operations, verifying file data after every read. However, it has never
been installed as part of the OS; it only exists in the source tree.
That makes it difficult to use in CI pipelines. It has some other
limitations, too.

So this quarter I rewrote the entire tool in Rust. The rewrite is
byte-for-byte compatible with the original, given identical seed values.
Future versions will break backwards-compatibility, however, in order to
add new features like fspacectl and copy_file_range. The new version can
be found in the ports tree, and in time I’ll remove the original.
