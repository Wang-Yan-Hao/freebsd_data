Here is the first status report of 2023, including 25 reports: we have
our usual team reports, some news about cloud projects, progress in the
src, ports and doc trees and more.

We also provide some information about 13.2-RELEASE, which was postponed
to the beginning of 2023Q2; but since this report is being published
after the new version release, it is already available for installation.
Users of RELEASE versions can now take advantage of many improvements
such as better support for the iwlwifi(4) driver or the new rtw88(4)
driver, topics that have been covered in past status reports.

Have a nice read.

Lorenzo Salvadore, on behalf of the status team.
