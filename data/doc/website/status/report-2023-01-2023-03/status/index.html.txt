The new workflow has started

In the first quarter of this year, the status team has started
implementing the new workflow that was announced at the end of 2022.
Here are some details.

New email addresses

Last quarter we have announced the creation of new email addresses:

-   <status@FreeBSD.org>, for interacting with the status team directly;

-   <status-submissions@FreeBSD.org, for sending reports submissions;

-   <freebsd-status-calls@FreeBSD.org>, a mailing list to which you can
    subscribe to get reminders about status report submission deadlines.

Unfortunately, the mailing list does not work as expected at the moment.
The issue has been reported but no solution could be found yet. However,
a work around allowed to send the second and the last reminder to the
list.

Automation

Some automation has been introduced to ensure that no report submission
is lost:

-   on Phabricator a herald rule automatically blocks any review
    touching the status reports directory: even if a report submitter
    forgets to add the status team as reviewer, salvadore@ (member of
    the status team) will block the patch anyway. The same rule will
    also block any review that includes the status team as reviewer, to
    ensure that at least one member of status has reviewed the patch
    before commit.

-   a GitHub action automatically adds the newly introduced status
    report label to any pull request touching the status reports
    directory. The GitHub action should be easily modifiable by anyone
    wanting to apply more labels automatically depending on the path of
    the modified files.

More automation is planned.

Documentation reorganization

The status report README and How To have been updated and merged in one
unique document: the FreeBSD status report process. You can check it out
to read details about reports submission and publication. It will be
updated regularly as the status team proceeds with the implementation of
its new workflow. In particular, new material about automation is coming
soon.
