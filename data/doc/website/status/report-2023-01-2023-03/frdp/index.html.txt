The FreeBSD Russian Documentation Project current goal is to provide
up-to-date Russian translations of the most significant parts of FreeBSD
documentation (FAQ, Handbook, Web). It is important to support
Russian-speaking persons with high-quality official technical materials
and increase acceptance of the operating system around the globe. We
hope that this activity will receive some support within the
Russian-speaking FreeBSD community and lead to an increased number of
translated materials.

FAQ translation was updated and synched with the latest original
version. There is also a very slight progress with web pages updates.

Check the official translation guide in case you are willing to help. We
will appreciate your help with translation of the following materials:

-   Web pages (easy)

-   Handbook sections (only the X11 section is in progress right now)

-   Articles
