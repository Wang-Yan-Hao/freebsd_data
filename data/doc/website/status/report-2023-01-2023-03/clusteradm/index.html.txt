Contact: Cluster Administration Team <clusteradm@FreeBSD.org>

FreeBSD Cluster Administration Team members are responsible for managing
the machines the Project relies on to synchronise its distributed work
and communications.

In this quarter, the team has worked on the following:

-   Regular support for FreeBSD.org user accounts.

-   Regular disk and parts support (and replacement) for all physical
    hosts and mirrors.

-   Improve the PowerPC package builders.

    -   With new parts obtained through the FreeBSD Foundation, the
        builders now have new NVMEs with heatsinks and more memory. It
        helped to solve the heat issue, and they are building packages
        faster now.

-   Decouple dynamic resources from the main websites.

    -   Work in coordination with doceng and webmaster to decouple
        dynamic resources from the websites, www.FreeBSD.org, and
        docs.FreeBSD.org.

Work in progress

-   Large-scale network upgrade at our primary site.

    -   New Juniper switches arrived at our primary site to replace the
        former ones. We thank Juniper for the donation.

-   Replace old servers in our primary site and a few mirrors.

    -   Besides the broken CI servers, we have a few old servers with
        broken disks and faulty PSUs. This task is in conjunction with
        the FreeBSD Foundation and donors/sponsors.

-   Deploy infrastructure to mirror the websites.

    -   Since the FreeBSD website is now mostly static, we have begun
        deploying infrastructure to mirror www.FreeBSD.org and
        docs.FreeBSD.org around the world in FreeBSD project-managed
        mirrors.

-   Create a new search database engine for internal FreeBSD.org
    searching needs like mailing list and docs.

FreeBSD Official Mirrors Overview

Current locations are Australia, Brazil, Germany, Japan (two full mirror
sites), Malaysia, South Africa, Taiwan, United Kingdom (full mirror
site), United States of America — California, New Jersey (primary site),
and Washington.

The hardware and network connection have been generously provided by:

-   Bytemark Hosting

-   Cloud and SDN Laboratory at BroadBand Tower, Inc

-   Department of Computer Science, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung
    University

-   Equinix

-   Internet Association of Australia

-   Internet Systems Consortium

-   INX-ZA

-   KDDI Web Communications Inc

-   Malaysian Research & Education Network

-   Metapeer

-   New York Internet

-   NIC.br

-   Your.Org.

The Frankfurt single server mirror is the primary Europe mirror in
bandwidth and usage.

We are still looking for an additional full mirror site (five servers)
in Europe to replace old servers in the United Kingdom full mirror site.

We see a good pattern in having single mirrors in Internet Exchange
Points worldwide (Australia, Brazil, and South Africa); if you know or
work for some of them that could sponsor a single mirror server, please
get in touch. United States (West Coast) and Europe (anywhere) are
preferable places.

See generic mirrored layout for full mirror site specs and tiny-mirror
for a single mirror site.
