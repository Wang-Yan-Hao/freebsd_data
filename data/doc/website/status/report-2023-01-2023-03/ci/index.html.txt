In the first quarter of 2023, we worked with the project contributors
and developers to address their testing requirements. Concurrently, we
collaborated with external projects and companies to enhance their
products by testing more on FreeBSD.

Important completed tasks:

-   FreeBSD-main-aarch64-KASAN_test and its supporting jobs have been
    added.

-   FreeBSD-stable-13-amd64-KASAN_test and its supporting jobs have been
    added.

-   FreeBSD-main-amd64-gcc12_build now sends failing reports to the
    committers whose commits may be related.

-   Various fixes or workarounds to the tests of non-x86 architectures
    from trasz@

-   Present Testing/CI Status Update in AsiaBSDCon 2023 Developer Summit

Work in progress tasks:

-   Designing and implementing pre-commit CI building and testing (to
    support the workflow working group)

-   Designing and implementing use of CI cluster to build release
    artifacts as release engineering does

-   Simplifying CI/test environment setting up for contributors and
    developers

-   Setting up the CI stage environment and putting the experimental
    jobs on it

-   Organizing the scripts in freebsd-ci repository to prepare for
    merging to src repository

-   Improving the hardware test lab and adding more hardware for testing

-   Merge https://reviews.freebsd.org/D38815

-   Merge https://reviews.freebsd.org/D36257

Open or queued tasks:

-   Collecting and sorting CI tasks and ideas

-   Setting up public network access for the VM guest running tests

-   Implementing use of bare-metal hardware to run test suites

-   Adding drm ports building tests against -CURRENT

-   Planning to run ztest tests

-   Helping more software get FreeBSD support in its CI pipeline (Wiki
    pages: 3rdPartySoftwareCI, HostedCI)

-   Working with hosted CI providers to have better FreeBSD support

Please see freebsd-testing@ related tickets for more WIP information,
and don’t hesitate to join the effort!
