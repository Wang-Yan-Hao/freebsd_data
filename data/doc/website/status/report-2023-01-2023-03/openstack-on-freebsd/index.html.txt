OpenStack on FreeBSD

This project aims to port key OpenStack components so that FreeBSD can
function as an OpenStack host.

In 2023 Q1, the big news is that we’re able to spawn FreeBSD instances
with bhyve(8) on the OpenStack platform. But there are still some major
limitations regarding the capabilities of the spawned instances that
need to be resolved:

-   No self-service networks (only support the flat network)

-   No network connectivity inside the instance

-   Only support FreeBSD raw images (FreeBSD-13.1-RELEASE-amd64.raw
    tested)

-   No disk resize

-   No console integration (need to use cu(1) command manually)

The step-by-step documents for constructing a POC site can be found in
the docs repository. The patched version of each OpenStack component is
under the same GitHub organization.

Also, we attended AsiaBSDCon 2023 at the end of March and gave a short
talk about the current project status at the developer summit. We got
precious feedback at the event and will focus on the following for the
next quarter:

-   Resolve the Open vSwitch networking issue

-   Convert each OpenStack component into FreeBSD ports

People interested in helping with the project can first help check the
documentation by following the installation guide. And here is an open
task for the project:

-   FreeBSD-specific implementation for the oslo.privsep library

Feedback and help are always welcome.
