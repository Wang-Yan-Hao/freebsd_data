The main news this quarter is the cleaning of old GCC versions from the
ports tree: this will allow for a more efficient approach to bugs.

Deprecation of old GCC ports

The ports tree still contains several ports related to old and
unsupported GCC versions. They are usually needed as dependencies for a
few old ports, that it would be better to either update to use a
supported GCC release, or deprecate. Bug reports have been created to
track the issue and work has already started towards its resolution.
Thanks to all ports contributors who are helping.

Deprecation of USE_GCC=X+

Gerald, who maintained the GCC ports for many years until recently,
still contributes to the GCC maintenance on FreeBSD by helping simplify
the GCC infrastructure in the ports tree, for example by removing
special cases that deal with old unsupported GCC versions.

This quarter the most significant of his changes is probably the removal
of support for the USE_GCC=X+ construct: any port depending on GCC
should set USE_GCC=yes if GCC_DEFAULT works; if not, it should require a
specific version (e.g. USE_GCC=11); it cannot ask for a minimal version
anymore (e.g. USE_GCC=11+).
