PkgBase.live was an unofficial repository for the FreeBSD PkgBase
project. As a service, PkgBase.live was inspired by https://up.bsd.lv/,
which provides freebsd-update(8) for STABLE and CURRENT branches.

Hardware for PkgBase was kindly sponsored by a member of the FreeBSD
community. However, as life and projects moved on, they had to
decommission the hardware, giving me three months' notice. In that time,
my own life was rather turbulent after a recent move to a different
country so I haven’t been able to find a replacement.

For the time being, PkgBase.live is dead.

The website, and with it the How Did She Do it?! are still available in
Git. I highly encourage copy-cats.

I will also happily accept a new hardware sponsor!

Please note that I have contacted the FreeBSD Project, and they are
working on integrating PkgBase into release engineering. However, they
are not yet ready, they also cannot "simply" take over PkgBase.live
because it uses a completely different process.
