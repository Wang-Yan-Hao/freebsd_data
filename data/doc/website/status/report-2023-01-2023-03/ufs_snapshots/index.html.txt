Enabling Snapshots on Filesystems Using Journaled Soft Updates in 13.2

Contact: Marshall Kirk McKusick <mckusick@freebsd.org>

The ability to make UFS/FFS filesystem snapshots when running with
journaled soft updates, and using them for doing background dumps on a
live filesystem, was merged to releng/13.2 during the first quarter of
2023, and lands in FreeBSD 13.2-RELEASE.

Background dumps are requested by using the -L flag to dump(8).

The details of this project were described in the 2022 fourth quarter
report.
