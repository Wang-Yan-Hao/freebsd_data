daemon(8) improvements

An ongoing effort to improve code quality and supervision capabilities
of the daemon utility. Daemon is a tool that can daemonize (send to
background) or supervise any running process, automatically restarting
it if it crashes. Daemon is widely used in the ports tree and can be
used more in base.

This quarter long_opts support was added and the codebase went through
an initial refactoring phase to prepare it for further changes. There
are no functional changes so far but more changes are coming. Please
contact directly or on #freebsd-dev on Libera IRC if you encounter
unexpected bugs.

Planned work items for the next quarter:

-   use of kqueue for all event sources

-   fix Bug #268580

-   fix Bug #236117

-   fix Bug #254511

-   fix Bug #212829

-   procctl PROC_REAP_ACQUIRE

We are looking for feedback, bug reports (old and new) and feature
requests.
