Introduction

The first quarter of 2005 has been extremely active in both
FreeBSD-CURRENT and -STABLE. With FreeBSD 5.4 in the final RC stage and
an anticipated branch of FreeBSD-6 this summer we have seen a lot of
performance improvements in 5 and a couple of exciting new features in
6.

The report turnout was extremely good and it seems that the webform
provided by Julian Elischer has made it more enjoyable to write reports.
Many thanks to Julian for providing this. We also like to get your
attention to the open tasks section provided in some reports.

On special note, please take a look at the report about the upcoming
BSDCan in Ottawa. There will be lots of interesting FreeBSD related
talks and activities. If you enjoy reading these reports, you will love
the conference. See you there!

Thanks to all the reporters, we hope you enjoy reading.

Contact: Gleb Smirnoff <glebius@FreeBSD.org>

CARP is an alternative to VRRP. In contrast to VRRP it has full support
for IPv6 and uses crypto to protect the advertisements. It was developed
by OpenBSD due to concerns that the HSRP patent might cover VRRP and
CISCO might defend its patent. CARP has, since then, improved a lot over
VRRP.

CARP has been committed to HEAD and MFCed to RELENG_5. It will be
available in upcoming 5.4-RELEASE.

Big thanks to all users who provided testing and reported bugs to Max
and Gleb. Daniel Seuffert has donated hardware to Max for this project.
Gleb's work was sponsored by Rambler .

Open tasks:

1.  Improve vlan(4) support. Test ng_eiface(4).
2.  Improve locking, consider removing interface layer.

The FreeBSD Java Project released its initial support for JDK 1.5.0 with
patch set 1 "Sabretooth" in January. The initial release featured
support for both FreeBSD 5.3/i386 and 5.3/amd64. Since then preliminary
support for FreeBSD 4.11/i386 has been added and several bug fixes have
been made. Updates in the coming months will add support for the browser
plug in and Java Web Start, which were not in the initial release.

Open tasks:

1.  Volunteers to look into some serious problems with JDK 1.5.0 on
    FreeBSD 4.x

FreeBSD 4.11, the final formal release of the 4.x series, was released
on 25 Jan 2005. Many thanks to the all of the developers and users over
the past 5 years who made it successful. While no more releases are
planned, the security team will continue to support it through security
update patches until 2007. Developers are also free to commit bug fixes
and low-risk features to the RELENG_4 branch for the foreseeable future.

FreeBSD 5.4 is going through its final release candidate stages and is
expected to be released in late April. Its focus is mostly bug fixes and
minor feature and performance improvements, so it is an excellent target
for those looking to upgrade from previous versions or to give FreeBSD a
try for the first time. FreeBSD 5.5 will be release in about 4-6 months
after 5.4.

FreeBSD 6.0 is rapidly approaching also. In contrast to FreeBSD 5.0, the
goal is to take a more incremental approach to major changes, and not
wait for years to get as many features in as possible. FreeBSD 6.0 will
largely be an evolutionary change from the 5.x series, with the largest
changes centered around multi-threading and streamlining the filesystem
and device layers. Feature freeze and code freeze for 6.0 are coming up
in May and June, and we hope to have 6.0 stable and ready for release in
July or August.

The release engineering team has also started doing monthly informal
snapshots of the 6-CURRENT and 5-STABLE trees. These are intended to
increase the exposure of new features and get more users involved in
testing and providing feedback. Snapshots can be found at
http://www.freebsd.org/snapshots.

Contact: Pawel Jakub Dawidek <pjd@FreeBSD.org>

GELI is a GEOM class used for GEOM providers encryption. I decided to
work on this, as I needed some feature, which cannot be found in similar
projects. Here is the list of features, I found interesting:

-   makes use of crypto(9)
-   if there is a crypto hardware available, GELI will run cryptography
    on it automatically; if not, it starts dedicated kernel thread and
    do crypto software work in there
-   supports many cryptographic algorithms (AES, Blowfish, 3DES)
-   is able to take key components from many sources at once (user
    entered passphrase, random bits from a file, etc.)
-   allows to encrypt root partition
-   user will be asked for the passphrase before root file system is
    mounted
-   uses "PKCS #5: Password-Based Cryptography Specification Version
    2.0" for user passphrase protection (optional)
-   allows to use two independent keys (e.g. "user key" and "company
    key")
-   is fast
-   GELI does simple sector-to-sector encryption
-   allows to backup/restore Master Keys, so when user have to quickly
    destroy keys, it is able to get the data back by restoring keys from
    the backup
-   provider can be configured at attach time to automatically detach on
    last close (so user don't have to remember to detach after
    unmounting file system)
-   allows to attach provider with a random, one-time keys
-   useful for swap partitions and temporary file systems

Open tasks:

1.  Code audit/review is more than welcome!

Contact: Pawel Jakub Dawidek <pjd@FreeBSD.org>

GSHSEC is a GEOM class used for handling shared secret data between
multiple GEOM providers. For every write request, SHSEC class splits the
data using XOR operation with random data, so N-1 providers gets just
random data and one provider gets the data XORed with the random data
from the other providers. All of the configured providers must be
present in order to reveal the secret. The class is already committed to
HEAD and RELENG_5 branches.

Contact: Colin Percival <cperciva@FreeBSD.org>

Shortly before the ports freeze for FreeBSD 5.4, I released a new
version of Portsnap. In addition to being secure and more efficient than
CVSup, this latest version distributes INDEX, INDEX-5, and INDEX-6
files, thereby eliminating the need to run "make fetchindex" and
ensuring that the ports INDEX will match the existing ports tree. In
addition, portsnap builds have now moved onto hardware managed by the
FreeBSD project, thereby sharply increasing portsnap's chances of
survival if I get hit by a bus.

In early February hardware problems caused both FreeBSD Update and
Portsnap to stop functioning for a few days, but those were resolved
thanks to a server donated by layeredtech.com.

I intend bring Portsnap into the FreeBSD base system before the end of
the month, followed by FreeBSD Update a few months later.

Contact: Sam Leffler <sam@FreeBSD.org>

There has been an ongoing effort to review the kernel source code using
Coverity's source code analysis tools (http://www.coverity.com). These
tools check for a variety of problems such as null pointer dereference,
use-after-free of allocated variables, invalid array references, etc.
This work is a joint project between FreeBSD and Coverity.

Two passes have been completed over the 6-current kernel source code
base and all significant problems have been corrected. These runs were
done in February and March of this year. A few reports of minor problems
await response from outside groups and will be resolved in time for the
first 6.x release. Another analysis run over the kernel will happen
soon. We are looking for a way to use these tools on a regular basis as
they have been helpful in improving the code base.

Thanks to Coverity for their help and especially Ted Unangst. Several
developers have been especially helpful in resolving reports:
Poul-Henning Kamp, David Schultz, Pawel Jakub Dawidek, George V.

  ------------------ -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contact: Nate Lawson <njl>

The cpufreq project was committed to 6-CURRENT in early February and has
undergone bugfixes and updates. It will soon be MFCd to 5-STABLE.

The cpufreq driver provides a unified kernel and user interface to CPU
frequency control drivers. It combines multiple drivers offering
different settings into a single interface of all possible levels. Users
can access this interface directly via sysctl(8), by indicating to
power_profile that it should switch settings when the AC line state
changes, or by using powerd(8).

For example, an absolute driver offering frequencies of 1000 Mhz and 750
Mhz combined with a relative driver offering settings of 100% and 50%
would result in cpufreq providing levels of 1000, 750, 500, and 375 Mhz.

Colin Percival helped with powerd(8), which provides automatic control
of CPU frequencies. The adaptive mode is especially interesting since it
attempts to respond to changes in system load while reducing power
consumption.

Current hardware drivers include acpi_perf (ACPI CPU performance
states), est (Intel Enhanced SpeedStep for Pentium-M), ichss (Intel's
original SpeedStep for ICH), and powernow (AMD Powernow! K7 and K8
support). Other drivers for relative hardware include acpi_throttle
(ACPI CPU throttling) and p4tcc (Pentium 4 Thermal Control Circuitry)

Thanks to Bruno Ducrot for the powernow driver, Colin Percival for the
est driver, and the many testers who have sent in feedback.

Open tasks:

1.  We'd appreciate someone with a Transmeta CPU converting the existing
    longrun driver to the cpufreq framework. It would also be good if
    someone wrote a VIA Longhaul driver. See the Linux
    arch/i386/kernel/cpu/cpufreq directory for examples.
2.  Various other architectures, including ARM, have CPU power control
    that could be implemented as a cpufreq driver.
3.  The powerd(8) algorithm is rather simple and we'd appreciate more
    help in testing it and alternative algorithms with various
    workloads. The -v flag causes powerd to report frequency transitions
    and print a summary of total energy used upon termination. This
    should help testers profile their algorithms.

Contact: Eric Anholt <anholt@FreeBSD.org>

A DRM update was finally committed to -current on 2005-04-15, after jhb@
did the necessary fix to vm_mmap. New development drivers were added for
mach64 and r300 (see URL for info). The nearly-finished code for savage
and i915 were also added, but left disconnected from the build. However,
the most visible change is likely the support for texture tiling, color
tiling, and HyperZ on Radeons, which (with updated userland) likely
provide a 50-75% framerate increase in many applications.

Open tasks:

1.  Find someone with newbus knowledge to figure out why the i915 won't
    attach to drmsub0.
2.  Finish porting the savage driver.
3.  Integrate busdma code from Tonnerre (NetBSD).

Filesystem journalling for UFS

  ------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          URL: http://repoman.freebsd.org/depotTreeBrowser.cgi?FSPC=//depot/user/scottl/ufsj
  ------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's time to bite the bullet and admit that fsck is no longer scalable
for modern storage capacities. While a healthy debate can still be had
on the merits and data integrity guarantees of journalling vs.
SoftUpdates, the fact that SoftUpdates still requires a fsck to ensure
consistency of the filesystem metadata after an unclean shutdown means
uptime is lost. While background fsck is available, it saps system
performance and stretched the fsck time out to hours.

Journalling provides a way to record transactions that might not have
fully been written to disk before the system crashed, and then quickly
recover the system back to a consistent state by replaying these
transactions. It doesn't guarantee that no data will be lost, but it
does guarantee that the filesystem will be back to a consistent state
after the replay is performed. This contrasts to SoftUpdates that
re-arranges metadata updates so that inconsistencies are minimized and
easy to recover from, though recovery still requires the traditional
full filesystem scan.

Journalling is a key feature of many modern filesystems like NTFS, XFS,
JFS, ReiserFS, and Ext3, so the ground is well covered and the risks for
UFS/FFS are low. I'm aware that groups from CMU and RPI have attempted
similar work in the past, but unfortunately the work is either very
outdates, or I haven't had any luck in contacting the groups. Is this
absence, I've decided to work on this project myself in hopes of having
a functional prototype in time for FreeBSD 6.0.

The approach is simple and journals full metadata blocks instead of just
deltas or high-level operations. This greatly simplifies the replay code
at the cost of requiring more disk space for the journal and more work
within the filesystem to identify discreet update points. An important
design consideration is whether to make the journal data and code
compatible with the UFS2 filesystem, or to start a new UFS3 derivative.
Since the latter presents a very high barrier to adoption for most
people, I'm going to try to make it a compatible option for UFS2. This
means that the journal blocks will likely appear as an unlinked file to
legacy filesystem and fsck code, and will be treated as such. This will
allow seamless fallback to using fsck, though once the unlinked journal
data blocks are reclaimed by fsck, the user will have to take action to
re-create the journal file again.

One key piece of journalling is ensuring that each journal transaction
is fully written to disk before the associated metadata blocks are
written to the filesystem. I plan to adopt the buffer 'pinning'
mechanism from Alexander Kabaev's XFS work to assist with this. This
will allow the journalling subsystem fine-grained control over which
blocks get flushed to disk by the buffer daemon without having to
further complicate the UFS/FFS code. One consideration is how
Softupdates falls into this and whether it is mutually exclusive of
journalling or if it can help provide transaction ordering functionality
to the journal. Research here is on-going.

Some preliminary work can be found in Perforce in the
//depot/user/scottl/ufsj/... tree or at the URL provided. Hopefully this
will quickly accelerate.

Infrastructure Cleanup

  -------
  Links
  -------

Contact: Warner Losh <imp@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Takahashi Yoshihiro <nyan@FreeBSD.org>

Unglamorous cleanup of the code base continues. The focus of recent
efforts have been to reduce the number of machine #ifdefs that are in
the machine independent code. In addition, we're also trying to increase
code sharing between pc98 and i386 ports and reduce the number of #ifdef
PC98 instances in the tree.

In addition, a number of cleanup tasks are underway for different parts
of the kernel that are more complicated than necessary. Recently, the
pccard code's allocation routines were simplified to reassign ownership
of resources more directly than before. The search is on for other areas
that can benefit from cleanup.

Open tasks:

1.  On pc98, there's no such thing as an ISA bus. It is desirable to
    move to having cbus appear in the probe messages. This would also
    allow for additional segregation of pc98 specific code in the
    drivers and eliminate many ifdefs. Ideally, isa and cbus would share
    a common newbus ancestor class so their similarities can be
    exploited (they both have PNPBIOS enumeration methods, for example).
2.  cbus devices can have complicated resources. There's support for
    vectors of resources. Yet there's no support for populating a vector
    of resources from the plug and play information. Doing so would help
    the complex world of pc98 a lot, and the odd edge cases in i386
    (floppy, ata) a little.
3.  The hints mechanism provides a way to associate hardware with
    drivers and resource that would otherwise be completely unknown to
    the system. A refinement in the hints mechanism to allow matching of
    driver instances to resources is desirable. This would allow one to
    hardwire sio0 to 0x2f8, even when the serial device in the plug and
    play resource list (or acpi resource list) is listed second. A
    further refinement could also be wiring sio0 to "port B" as defined
    by acpi or some other enumeration method. Chances are good that
    these seemingly related concepts may need separate implementations
    due to the decision points for unit assignment.
4.  Pccard, cardbus and usb probe their devices after interrupts are
    enabled. It would be desirable to hook into new kernel APIs to allow
    the mounting of root to be put off until those systems know that
    they are done with their initial probe of the devices present at
    boot.

Interrupt Latency

  -------
  Links
  -------

Contact: Warner Losh <imp@FreeBSD.org>

I've setup a test system to measure interrupt latency on FreeBSD 5.3 and
current. So far I've measured the baseline latency for a 300MHz embedded
cyrix based single board computer. I've tried a number of different
strategies to optimize the interrupt path. Most of these strategies
resulted in some improvement of the time it takes to get from the start
of the interrupt servicing to the driver's ISR. These improvements
turned out to be about 1-2% of the processing times on this single board
computer, but a wash on faster machines. However, the time between when
the interrupt should happen, and when FreeBSD starts to service the
interrupt is the dominant factor in these measurements. Despite the fact
that these are fast interrupt handlers (so the scheduler is out of the
loop), I routinely see average latencies of 18us, with large variations
(on the order of 5us standard deviation).

Open tasks:

1.  I need to measure the latencies with 4.x and current to characterize
    the differences more precisely. I'm especially interested in the
    effects on interrupt latency that the elimination of mixed mode will
    cause.
2.  I need to characterize different parts of our ISR routines to see if
    some of the variation I've seen so far can be reduced by improved
    coding techniques.
3.  I need to re-run my tests with 5.4 and summarize my results in a
    paper.

Contact: Joseph Koshy <jkoshy@FreeBSD.org>

Many modern CPUs have on-chip performance monitoring counters (PMCs)
that can be used to count low-level hardware events like instruction
retirals, branch mispredictions, cache and TLB misses and the like. PMC
architectures and capabilities vary between CPU vendors and between CPU
generations from the same vendor, making the creation of portable
applications difficult. This project attempts to provide a uniform API
for applications to use, and the necessary infrastructure to
"virtualize" and manage the available PMC hardware resources. The
creation of performance analysis tools that use this infrastructure is
also part of the project's goals.

Work since the last status report:

-   Support for Intel
    Pentium-Pro/Pentium-II/Pentium-III/Pentium-M/Celeron style PMCs has
    been added.
-   The Pentium-4/HTT machine dependent layer has been overhauled.
-   A Python language interface to the C library interface pmc(3) has
    been written.
-   Many bugs have been fixed and documentation has been updated.

Open tasks:

1.  The code needs to be tested on Intel Pentium-M, Celeron, Pentium II
    and Pentium Pro CPUs.

I'm currently looking at the limit on the number of subdirectories a
directory can have in UFS. There is currently a limit of 32K
subdirectories because of the 16 bit link count field in both struct
stat and the on-disk inode format. The thread above shows that dirhash
provides acceptable performance for directories with 100k subdirectories
using a prototype patch. Two options for allowing many subdirectories
seem to exist: changing the link counting scheme for directories and
expanding the link count field. The prototype patch implements the first
scheme and there are plans to investigate the second scheme (which may
require an ABI change).

Status Report for FreeBSD ATA driver project

Contact: Søren Schmidt <sos@FreeBSD.org>

ATA mkIII has been committed to -current after a couple of month testing
as patches post on -current and 5-stable. I will continue to provide
patches for 5-stable for those that need up-to-date ATA support there.

Here a short rehash of what mkIII brings:

ATA is now fully modular so each part can be loaded/unloaded at will to
provided the wanted functionality.

Much improved SATA support that support hotplug events on controllers
that support it (Promise, SiS, nVidia so far) ie the system will
automagically detect when SATA devices come and go and add/delete device
entries etc.

Much improved ATA RAID support. The ata-raid driver has been largely
rewritten to take advantage of the features the improved infrastructure
provides, including composite ATA operations etc. The rebuild
functionality has been changed to rebuild on userland reads, so a simple
dd of the entire array will get it rebuild (what atacontrol now does).
This means that the resources used for this can be better tailored to
the actually usage pattern if needed. ATA RAID now supports 10+
different RAID metadata formats, so most BIOS defined ATA RAID arrays
can be picked up and used. The number of metadata formats that can be
created from within FreeBSD is still limited though and is not a high
priority feature right now.

The lowlevel infrastructure of the ATA driver has been refined even
further to support "strange" chipsets much more easily and in most case
transparent to the higher levels. This to easy ports to new platforms
where ATA controllers doesn't necessarily have the x86 legacy layout.

Lots of bug fixes and corrections all over the driver proper. The rework
of the infrastructure has revealed bugs and deficiencies that has been
fixed in the process of modulerising ATA and making the infrastructure
more generic, and hopefully easier to understand.

The work continues to keep ATA on top of new chipsets and other
advancements in the ATA camp. SATA ATAPI support is in the works and so
are support for NCA/TCQ (tags). Donations of unsupported hardware is the
way to get it supported as I'm way out of my budget for new hardware for
the next decade or so according to my wife :)

Open tasks:

1.  Lots of testing wanted, especially SATA and RAID support

Storage driver SMPng locking

  -------
  Links
  -------

Contact: Scott Long <scottl@FreeBSD.org>

Several storage drivers have been taken out from under the Giant mutex
in the past few months. Thanks to sponsorship from FreeBSD Systems, Inc
and ImproWare, AG, Switzerland , the LSI MegaRAID (AMR) and IBM/Adaptec
ServeRAID (IPS) drivers have been locked. SMPng locking is a key step in
improving the performance of system drivers in FreeBSD 5.x and beyond,
and both of these drivers are showing the benefits of this. FreeBSD 5.4
will contains these improvements when it is released.

Similar work is ongoing with the 3WARE Escalade (TWE) driver, and
preliminary patches have been made available to testers. I hope to have
this driver complete in time for the next FreeBSD release.

Unfortunately, most benefits can only be gained from pure block storage
drivers such as the ones mentioned here due to the SCSI subsystem in
FreeBSD (CAM) not be locked itself at this time. It is possible,
however, to lock a CAM sub-driver and bring the driver's interrupt
handler out from under Giant for a partial gain. The Sun FAS366 SCSI
driver (ESP) operates like this. Volunteers to lock other drivers or to
tackle locking CAM are gladly accepted, so please contact me if you are
interested.

Contact: Brooks Davis <brooks@FreeBSD.org>

In April 18th, I committed support for IPv6 to IPFW. This support was
written by two student of Luigi's, Mariano Tortoriello and Raffaele De
Lorenzo. I updated it to use PFIL_HOOKS and fixed a few minor issues. As
of this commit, IP6FW should be considered deprecated in favor of IPFW.
It should be possible to MFC this change to 5.x, but that is not
currently planned.

Open tasks:

I have finished the basic functionality for both IPv4 and IPv6. The
userland utilities ("arp" and "ndp") have been updated. I have tested
the changes with "make buildworld". I have been testing the new code in
a production environment and things appear to be stable. Gleb Smirnoff
(glebius@FreeBSD.org) has provided review comments and I have
incorporated these feedback into the patch. I have discussed the IPv6
changes with two of the core KAME developers during the last IETF
meeting in March 2005. They indicated that these changes may result in
divergence from the KAME project but that is not necessarily a bad
thing.

Open tasks:

1.  I am waiting for review feedback from my mentor Andre. I need
    locking experts to help me fix my giant-lock shortcut. I am hoping
    to send out the code for wider review soon.

This report covers period since August 2004 until April 2005.

New nodes. Two new nodes have been added to base FreeBSD distribution.
ng_netflow(4) node, which implements NetFlow version 5 accounting of
IPv4 packets. ng_ipfw(4) node, which diverts packets from ipfw(4) to
netgraph(4) and back. A well known ng_ipacct node has been added to
ports tree.

SMP. Nodes, which need to allocate unique names have been protected with
mutex in RELENG_5, and subr_unit allocator in HEAD. Nodes, which need to
run periodical jobs were reworked to use mpsafe ng_callout() API.
ng_tty(4) node has been overhauled to be compatible with
debug.mpsafenet=1. NetGraph ISR and callout are now declared MPSAFE in
HEAD.

NetGraph flow control. Two nodes ng_ether(4) and ng_cisco(4) have been
improved to emit flow control messages to upstream node, when state of
link changes. New link failure detection method have been introduced in
ng_one2many(4) node - listening to these flow control messages from
downstream.

Open tasks:

1.  more SMP testing of many nodes
2.  review locking of graph restructuring
3.  ng_nat node - an in-kernel natd(8)

Four new wireless drivers were imported:

ipw : driver for Intel PRO/Wireless 2100 adapters (MiniPCI).
iwi : driver for Intel PRO/Wireless 2200BG/2225BG/2915ABG adapters (PCI
or MiniPCI).
ral : driver for Ralink RT2500 wireless adapters (PCI or CardBus).
ural : driver for Ralink RT2500USB wireless USB 2.0 adapters.

The ipw and iwi drivers require firmwares to operate.
These firmwares can't be redistributed with the base system due to
license restrictions.
See firmware licensing terms here:
http://ipw2100.sourceforge.net/firmware.php?fid=4 .

Ports which include the firmware images as well as the firmware loader
are being worked on.
A list of adapters supported by ral and ural can be found here:

Open tasks:

1.  Create ports for ipw and iwi firmwares.
2.  Add IBSS support to iwi.
3.  Add WPA (802.11i) support to ipw and iwi.
4.  Add hardware encryption (WEP, TKIP and CCMP) support in ral and

This project is an attempt to clean up handling of network interfaces in
order to allow interfaces to be removed reliably. Current problems
include panics if Dummynet is delaying packets to an interface when it
is removed.

I am currently working to remove struct ifnet's from device driver
structures to allow them to be managed properly upon device removal. I
believe I have removed all known instances of casting a struct ifnet
pointer to something else (except that that are just magic values and
not real struct ifnets.) I will begin committing these changes to the
tree shortly and will then add a new function if_alloc() that will
allocate struct ifnets. if_detach() will be modified to destroy them.

WPA-PSK support for the ndis driver was contributed by Arvind Srinivasa.

A new tx rate control algorithm for the ath driver was contributed by
John Bicket. It will become the default algorithm shortly.

Work on multi-bss support is going on outside the cvs tree. A
presentation on this work will be given at BSDCan 2005 and the slides

Userland programs

libthread

  -------
  Links
  -------

Contact: David Xu <davidxu@FreeBSD.org>

libthread is a pure 1:1 threading library, it had stayed in my perforce
branch for a long time, recent it was imported into source tree and
replaced libthr. The purpose of the work is to improve 1:1 threading on
FreeBSD, the library is designed in mind that simplest is best,
currently it can run almost all of the applications libpthread can run,
but gives you better SMP performance. The library size is smaller than
libpthread.

Currently it supports i386, AMD64, sparc64 and ia64 and may support
alpha, powerpc and arm. I didn't do many tests on sparc64 and ia64, I
only tested it on FreeBSD cluster machines. For i386, I always used LDT,
but know that Peter committed GDT code, and now there is no 8191 threads
limitation anymore.

libthread_db was updated to support debugging the new libthr. It is an
assistant library used by gdb to debug threaded process, that
understands internal detail of thread libraries. I have improved it a
bit to support event reports for libthr, currently it can report thread
creation and death events. That means a thread that was created and died
will be reported to the user regardless if you are tracking it or not.

Open tasks:

1.  I am working on thread creation performance, currently it needs
    considerable number of libc functions and syscalls to create a
    thread, I would like to introduce a syscall to create a thread in
    atomically. That means one syscall will setup thread entry, tls, and
    signal mask and PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS/SYSTEM; in future maybe even
    CPU affinity masks, when userland entry code is executed, the thread
    is already fully setup.
2.  Process shareable synchronization objects. In Current FreeBSD does
    not support this specification. The idea about the shareable mutex
    and others is like other systems did, one can use mmap() to create a
    shared memory page, and put a pthread synchronization object in the
    page, multiple processes use the shared object to control resource
    access. I am not working on it, if someone is interested, please let
    me know.

A new sub-namespace, called pipe, has been added to portalfs. The pipe
namespace executes the named command, starting back at the root
directory. The command's arguments can be provided after the command's
name, by separating them with spaces or tabs. Files opened for reading
in the pipe namespace will receive their input from the command's
standard output; files opened for writing will send the data of write
operations to the command's standard input. The pipe namespace allows us
to perform scatter gather operations without using temporary files,
create non-linear pipelines, and implement file views using symbolic
links.

process and include VuXML information. In addition, RESTRICTED and
NO_CDROM have been added to list of things that FreshPorts keeps track
of. For unmaintained ports, we recently added this message:

There is no maintainer for this port.
Any concerns regarding this port should be directed to the FreeBSD Ports
mailing list via ports@FreeBSD.org

FreshPorts, with direct and indirect support from the FreeBSD community,

As this report was being written, the 5.4 release was ongoing.

A new charter for the Ports Management (portmgr) team was approved by
core and has been posted at the URL above. In addition, two other new
pages describe the policies of the team, and the range of QA activities
both during and between releases.

Due to being absent from email discussions for some time, Oliver
Eikemeier (eik) was moved to non-voting status on portmgr.

We have added several new and very active committers recently; this is
helping us to keep the PR count low even with the large numbers of new
ports that have been added.

Several more iterations of infrastructure changes have been tested on
the cluster and committed; see /usr/ports/CHANGES for details.

Updates have occurred to x.org, GNOME, KDE, and perl.

There have been some updates to the Porter's Handbook, but more sections
are still in need of updates to include recent changes in practices.

The ports collection now contains almost 12,750 ports.

Open tasks:

1.  Further progress has been made in cracking down on ports that
    install files outside the approved directories and/or do not
    deinstall cleanly (see "Extra files not listed in PLIST" on
    pointyhat ) and this will remain a focus area. We appreciate
    everyone who has sent in PRs or committed fixes.
2.  Demand for new features and revisions for bsd.port.mk is still very
    high and the portmgr team is trying to work through them all.
3.  We still have a large number of PRs that have been assigned to
    committers for some time (in fact, they constitute the majority).
    One goal of portmgr in the coming months is to try to reduce this
    number, and we would like to ask our committers to help us out as
    much as possible.

Contact: Emulation Mailinglist <freebsd-emulation@FreeBSD.org>

The update to RedHat 8 as discussed in the last status report went
smoothly (just some minor glitches which got resolved fast).

As a next step a cleanup/streamlining and the possibility of overriding
the default Linux base is in progress. This depends on changes which
need at least one testrun on the ports build cluster, so the final date
for those changes depends upon the availability of the cluster
resources.

Open tasks:

1.  Refactoring the common RPM code into bsd.rpm.mk.
2.  Determining which up-to-date Linux distribution to use as the next
    default Linux base. Important criteria:
    -   RPM based (to be able to use the existing infrastructure)
    -   good track record regarding availability of security fixes
    -   packages available from several mirror sites
    -   available for several hardware architectures (e.g. i386, amd64,
        sparc64; Note: not all architectures have a working linuxolator
        for their native bit with, but as long as there are no userland
        bits available, no motivation regarding writing the kernel bits
        will arise)
3.  Moving the linuxolator userland to an up-to-date version (see
    above).

A newly re-architected twa(4) driver was committed to 6 -CURRENT on
04/12/2005. Highlights of this release are:

1.  The driver has been re-architected to use a "Common Layer" (all
    tw_cl* files), which is a consolidation of all OS-independent parts
    of the driver. The FreeBSD OS specific portions of the driver go
    into an "OS Layer" (all tw_osl* files). This re-architecture is to
    achieve better maintainability, consistency of behavior across OS's,
    and better portability to new OS's (drivers for new OS's can be
    written by just adding an OS Layer that's specific to the OS, by
    complying to a "Common Layer Programming Interface (CLPI)" API. If
    there's interest in porting the 3ware driver to any other OS, you
    may contact ctchu at amcc.com to get a copy of the CLPI
    specifications.
2.  The driver takes advantage of multiple processors. It does not need
    to be Giant protected anymore.
3.  The driver has a new firmware image bundled, the new features of
    which include Online Capacity Expansion and multi-lun support, among
    others. More details about 3ware's 9.2 release can be found here:

BSDCan made a strong debut in 2004 . The favorable reception gave us a
strong incentive for 2005 . We have been rewarded with a very
interesting program and a higher rate of registrations. Percentage-wise,
we have more Europeans than last year as they have decided that the trip
across the Atlantic is worth taking. We know they won't be disappointed.
See you at BSDCan 2005!

In January 2005, Warner Losh (Security Officer Emeritus) stepped down
from the FreeBSD Security Team in order to better devote his time to
other projects. In March, Colin Percival was named as a second Deputy
Security Officer, joining Dag-Erling Smørgrav in that position. The
current Security Team membership is published on the web site.

So far in 2005, four security advisories have been issued concerning
problems in the base system of FreeBSD, three of which were specific to
FreeBSD. The Vulnerabilities and Exposures Markup Language (VuXML)
document has continued to be updated by the Security Team and the Ports
Committers documenting new vulnerabilities in the FreeBSD Ports
Collection. As of April 17, 127 entries have been added in 2005 bringing
the FreeBSD VuXML file up to a total of 422 entries.

In the past months both the VuXML web site and the FreshPorts VuXML
integration have been improved. The VuXML web site has had a face lift
and, among other things, each package now has a separate web page which
lists all documented vulnerabilities for the particular package. CVE
information is now also included directly on the VuXML web site.

Finally, the first few months of 2005 also saw FreeBSD 4.8 -- the first
release to be offered "extended support" -- reach its designated End of
Life. The currently supported releases are FreeBSD 4.10, 4.11, and 5.3.

IMUNES is a scalable kernel-level network topology emulator based on
FreeBSD. In IMUNES each virtual node operates on its private instance of
network stack state variables, such as routing tables, interface
addresses, sockets, ipfw rules etc. Most if not all existing FreeBSD
application binaries, including routing protocol daemons such as quagga
or XORP, can run unmodified within the context of virtual nodes with no
noticeable performance penalty. Complex network topologies can be
constructed by connecting the virtual nodes through netgraph-based
link-layer paths. A GUI tool allows for simple and intuitive network
topology specification, deployment and management. The current version
of IMUNES is based on FreeBSD 4.11-RELEASE and supports IPv4.
