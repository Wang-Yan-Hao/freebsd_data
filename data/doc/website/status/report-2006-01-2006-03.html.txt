Introduction

The highlights of this quarters report certainly include the
availability of native Java binaries thanks to the FreeBSD Foundation ,
as well as progress has been made with Xen support and Sun's Ultrasparc
T1. Furthermore we are looking forward to FreeBSD 6.1 and TrustedBSD
audit support has been imported into FreeBSD 7-CURRENT. All in all, a
very exiting start to 2006.

In just under a month the developers will be gathering at BSDCan 2006
for, FreeBSD Dev Summit, a two day meeting of FreeBSD developers. Once
again the BSDCan schedule is filled with many interesting talks.

We hope you enjoy reading and look forward to hear from you for the next
round. Consult the list of projects and ideas for ways to get involved.
The submission date for the second quarter reports will be July, 7th
2006.

Thanks to everybody who submitted a report and to Brad Davis, who joined
the Status Report team, for proof reading.

The BSDInstaller integration work has progressed since the previous
report. The backend has been changed to the new Lua version. This is to
ensure the version we use will be maintained. The release Makefile now
uses the Lua package rather the local copy in Perforce. Ports are also
being created for the required modules to remove the need to bring Lua
into the base.

Open tasks:

1.  Create a port for all the Lua modules required

Contact: Daniel Eischen <deischen@FreeBSD.org>

Symbol versioning libraries allows us to maintain binary compatibility
without bumping library version numbers. Recently, symbol versioning for
libc, libpthread, libthread_db, and libm was committed to -current. It
is disabled by default, and can be enabled by adding
"SYMVER_ENABLED=true" to/etc/make.conf. A final version bump for libc
and other affected libraries (perhaps all) should be done before
enabling this by default.

Open tasks:

1.  Determining the impact on ports - portmgr (Kris) is running a
    portbuild to identify any problems. I am working to resolve the few
    problems that were found.
2.  Making our linker link to libc and libpthread (when using
    (-pthread)) when building shared libraries. This is needed so that
    symbol version dependencies are recorded in the shared library. I
    think kan@ is working on this.???
3.  Identify and symbol version any other libraries that should be
    symbol versioned. If anyone has any suggestions, I'm all ears.

Contact: Robert Watson <rwatson@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: <trustedbsd-audit@TrustedBSD.org>

In the past three months, the TrustedBSD CAPP audit implementation has
been merged to the FreeBSD 7-CURRENT development tree in CVS, and the
groundwork has been laid for a merge to 6.X. OpenBSM, a BSD-licensed
implementation of Sun's Basic Security Module (BSM) API and file format,
as well as extensions to support intrusion detect applications. New
features included support for audit pipes, a pseudo-device that provides
a live audit record trail interface for intrusion detection
applications, and an audit filter daemon that allows plug-in modules to
monitor live events.

Open tasks:

1.  Complete audit coverage of non-native system call ABIs, some more
    recent base system calls.
2.  Integrate OpenBSM 1.0 alpha 6, which includes auditfilterd and the
    audit filter API.

OpenBSM is a BSD-licensed implementation of Sun's Basic Security Module
(BSM) API and file format, based on Apple's Darwin implementation.
OpenBSM 1.0 alpha 5 is now available, and includes significant bugfixes,
documentation, and feature enhancements over previous releases,
including 64-bit token support, endian-independent operation, improved
memory management, and bug fixes resulting from the static analysis
tools provided by Coverity and FlexeLint. Recent versions are now built
and configured using autoconf and automake, and have been built and
tested with FreeBSD, Mac OS X, and Linux.

Open tasks:

1.  Complete OpenBSM file format validation test suite.
2.  Finalize audit filter API.
3.  Complete file format documentation; record documentation for new
    record types associated with Mac OS X, FreeBSD, and Linux specific
    events not present in documented Solaris record format.

Network infrastructure

Bridge STP Improvements

Contact: Andrew Thompson <thompsa@FreeBSD.org>

Work has been started to implement the Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol
which supersedes STP. RSTP has a much faster link failover time of
around one second compared to 30-60 seconds for STP, this is very
important on modern networks. Some progress has been made but a RSTP
capable switch will be needed soon to proceed, see
http://www.freebsd.org/donations/wantlist.html .

Open tasks:

1.  Donation of a RSTP switch

Contact: Bjoern A. Zeeb <bz@FreeBSD.org>

Split out of PF_KEY code between the kernel and user space has been
completed and committed to CVS.

The diff between Kame IPv4 based IPSec and FAST_IPSEC IPv4 did not show
any glaring issues.

Moving on to making IPv6 work in FAST_IPSEC including being able to run
the kernel with the following variations:

-   FAST_IPSEC in v4 only
-   KAME IPv6 and IPSec
-   KAME IPv6 and FAST_IPSEC

Open tasks:

1.  Any patches for FAST_IPSEC, KAME IPsec of either variant (v4 or v6)
    should be forwarded to bz@ and gnn@.
2.  Build a better TAHI. TAHI, the test framework, will not be
    maintained and is not the easiest system to use and understand. A
    better test harness is possible and is necessary for other
    networking projects as well. Contact gnn@ if you have time to work
    on this as he has some code and ideas to start from.

FreeBSD NFS Status Report

Contact: Chuck Lever <cel@FreeBSD.org>

Support for NFS in FreeBSD received a boost this quarter as a kernel
developer from Network Appliance has volunteered to help with the
clients. Chuck Lever is now a src committer, mentored by Mike
Silbersack. Mohan Srinivasan and Jim Rees have ended their
apprenticeships and are now full committers. Mohan continues his effort
to make the NFSv2/3 client SMP safe. He expects to make the changes
available for review soon.

FreeBSD gained presence at the annual NFS interoperability event known
as Connectathon. Rick Macklem's FreeBSD NFSv4 server is pretty stable
now and available via anonymous ftp. NFSv4.1 features are not a part of
it yet and are not likely to happen until at least the end of 2006.
Contact rick@snowhite.cis.uoguelph.ca for details.

  FreeBSD Netperf Project   URL: http://www.FreeBSD.org/projects/netperf/
  ------------------------- -----------------------------------------------

Contact: Robert Watson <rwatson@FreeBSD.org>

The FreeBSD netperf project has recently focused on revising the socket
and protocol control block reference counts to define and enforce
reference and memory management invariants, allowing the removal of
unnecessary checks, error handling, and locking. Use of global pcbinfo
locks has now been eliminated from the socket send and receive paths
into all network protocols, including netipx, netnatm, netatalk,
netinet, netinet6, netgraph, and others. Checks have generally been
replaced with assertions; so_pcb is now guaranteed to be non-NULL. This
should improve performance by reducing lock contention and unnecessary
checks, as well as facilitate future work to eliminate long holding of
pcbinfo locks in the TCP input path through proper reference counting
for pcbs. These changes have been committed to FreeBSD 7-CURRENT, and
will be merged in a few months once they have stabilized.

and pmccontrol(8)) for measuring system performance using event
monitoring hardware in modern CPUs.

New features since the last status report:

-   Support for profiling dynamically loaded kernel and user objects has
    been added.
-   pmcstat(8) now supports command-line syntax for logging to a network
    socket.

  Start of Intel HDA support.   URL: http://www.leidinger.net/FreeBSD/hdac-20060313.tbz

Contact: Multimedia Mailinglist <freebsd-multimedia@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Ariff Abdullah <ariff@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Alexander Leidinger <netchild@FreeBSD.org>

A lot of fixes (bugs, LORs, panics) and improvements (performance,
compatibility, a new driver, 24/32bit samples support, ...) have been
merged to RELENG_6. FreeBSD 6.1 is the first release which ships with
the much improved sound system. Additionally there's work underway:

-   To make the sound system API endianess clean. This should make it
    easier (for a developer) to make the sound drivers usable on all
    architectures.
-   To rework character device allocation. This way someone can choose a
    specific channel, e.g. /dev/dsp0.r0 or /dev/dsp0.p0 to access the
    first recording or play channel respectively). With the "current"
    sound system (as in FreeBSD 6.1) this is not possible (accessing
    /dev/dsp0.0 and /dev/dsp0.1 may give you the first or the second
    channel, the number is just an enumeration, not a channel-chooser).
-   To add multi-channel support/processing.
-   To add Intel HDA support. There's already some code to look at (see
    URL referenced above), but is far from usable for an enduser (we
    need some programmers, but no testers ATM, since there are no user
    testable parts yet). Interested volunteers should contact the
    multimedia mailinglist.

Parts of this work may be already in 6.1, but there's still a good
portion which isn't even in -current as of this writing.

Open tasks:

1.  Style(9) cleanup, survive against WARNS=2 (at least).
2.  Have a look at the sound related entries on the ideas list.
3.  Rewrite some parts (e.g. a new mixer subsystem with OSS
    compatibility).
4.  sndctl(1): tool to control non-mixer parts of the sound system (e.g.
    spdif switching, virtual-3D effects) by an user (instead of the
    sysctl approach in -current); pcmplay(1), pcmrec(1), pcmutil(1).
5.  Plugable FEEDER infrastructure. For ease of debugging various feeder
    stuff and/or as userland library and test suite.
6.  Closer compatibility with OSS, especially for the upcoming OSS v4.

Status Report ATA project

Contact: SÃ¸ren Schmidt <sos@FreeBSD.org>

The last months has mostly been about stabilizing ATA for 6.1-RELEASE,
and adding support for new chipsets. On that front JMicron has raised
the bar for vendors as they have provided not only hardware but
documentation on both their hardware and their software RAID
implementation, making it a breeze to add support for their, by the way
excellent, products. Other vendors can join in here. :) Otherwise I'm
always in the need for any amount of time or means to get it if nothing
else.

ATA has grown a USB backend so that fx. flash keys and external
HD/CD/DVD drives can be used directly without atapicam/CAM etc. This is
very handy on small (embedded) systems where resources are limited and
kernel space at a premium. burncd(8) is in the process of being updated
so it will support this along with SATA ATAPI devices, and if time
permits adding DVD support.

The next months will be used to (hopefully) work on getting ATA to work
properly on systems with > 4G of memory and utilize the 64bit addressing
of controllers that support it. RAID5 support for ataraid is on the list
together with hardening of the RAID subsystem to help keep data alive
and well.

selecting one mechanism over the other. Your opinion is solicited.

The FreeBSD list of projects and ideas for volunteers is doing well.
Several items were picked up by volunteers and have found their way into
the tree. Others are under review or in progress.

We are looking forward to hear about new ideas, people willing to be
technical contacts for generic topics (e.g. USB) or specific entries
(already existing or newly created), suggestions for existing entries or
completion reports for (parts of) an entry.

Open tasks:

1.  Add more ideas.
2.  Find more technical contacts.
3.  Find people willing to review/test implementations of (somewhat)
    finished items.

The current mouse system is a mess with moused, psm, ums, and mse
supporting, individually, multiple kinds of mice. This project aims to
move all driver support into moused modules in userland. In addition,
many features lacking in the existing mouse infrastructure are being

far the board boots, and has somewhat working ethernet (some unexplained
packet loss). I can netboot from a FreeBSD/i386 machine, and I can also
mount msdosfs's on CF.

Open tasks:

1.  Figuring out why some small packets transmit with error (if someone
    can get Technologic Systems to pay attention to me and this issue,
    that'd be great!)
2.  EP93xx identification information to properly attach various onboard

FreeBSD on Xen 3.0

  -------

  -------

Contact: Scott Long <scottl@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Kip Macy <kmacy@FreeBSD.org>

We had hoped to finish a prototype of Xen DomU and possible Dom0 in time
for FreeBSD 6.1. The primary work was focused on bringing Xen into the
FreeBSD 'newbus' framework. Unfortunately, an architectural problem in
FreeBSD has stopped us. Xen relies on message passing between to child
and parent domains to communicate device configuration, and this message
passing requires that tsleep and wakeup work early in boot. That doesn't
seem to be the case, and it's unclear what it would take to make it
work. Without the newbus work, it's hard to complete the Dom0 code, and
impossible to support Xen 3.0 features like domain suspension.

Open tasks:

1.  Make tsleep and wakeup work during early boot
2.  Continue DomU newbus work
3.  Continue Dom0 work

During this time, the number of ports PRs rose dramatically from its
impressive low number seen late last quarter. This was due to the
holidays, the freeze for the 5.5/6.1 release cycle, and the aggressive
work several submitters have been doing to correct long-standing
problems with stale distfiles, stale WWW sites, port that only work on
i386, and so forth. Over 200 new ports have also been added. The
statistics do not truly reflect the state of the Ports Collection, which
continues to improve despite the increased number of ports.

We now have 3 people who are qualified to run the 5-exp regression
tests. Due to this, we were able to run several cycles, resulting in a
series of commits that retired more than 3 dozen portmgr PRs. There were
a few snags during one commit due to some unintended consequences, but
the breakage was fixed in less than one day. Notable changes include the
addition of physical category net-p2p and virtual categories hamradio
and rubygems. Once 5.5 and 6.1 are released, portmgr hopes to be able to
run regression tests more often.

We have added 5 new committers since the last report.

Open tasks:

1.  We need help getting back to our modern low of 500 PRs.
2.  We have over 4,000 unmaintained ports (see, for instance, the list
    on portsmon ). We are always looking for dedicated volunteers to
    adopt at least a few ports.

Update of the linux infrastructure in the Ports Collection

  -------

  -------

Contact: Emulation Mailinglist <freebsd-emulation@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Alexander Leidinger <netchild@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Boris Samorodov <bsam@ipt.ru>

Work is underway to use the new linux_base-fc3 as the new default linux
base. Since there's some infrastructure work to do before it can be made
the new default, this will not happen before the release of FreeBSD 5.5
and 6.1. At the same time a new X.org based linux port will replace the
outdated XFree86 based linux X11 port.

The use of fc3 instead of fc4 or fc5 is to make sure we have a smooth
transition with as less as possible breakage. We already use several fc3
RPM's with the current default of linux_base-8, so there should be not
much problems to solve.

Open tasks:

1.  Mark all old linux_base ports as DEPRECATED (after making fc3 the
    default linux_base port).
2.  Have a look at a linux-dri version which works with the update to
    X.org.
3.  When everything is switched to fc3 and everything works at least as
    good as before, have a look at porting fc4 or fc5.

Java Binaries

  FreeBSD Foundation Java Homepage   URL: http://www.freebsdfoundation.org/downloads/java.shtml
  ---------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------

Contact: Deb Goodkin <deb@freebsd.org>

The FreeBSD Foundation released official certified JDK and JRE 1.5
binaries for the official FreeBSD 5.4 and FreeBSD 6.0 releases on the
i386 platform.
We were able to accomplish this by hiring a contractor to run the Sun
certification tests and fixing the problems found. This could not have
been completed without the support from the BSD Java Team.

We provided financial support for Java development and funded the
certification process. We spent a significant amount of time and money
on legal issues from contract and NDA creation for our contractor to
license agreements from Sun and creating our own for the binaries. We
worked with OEMs who would like to use the binaries, but needed to
understand what they need to do legally to be able to redistribute the
binaries. This is an area we are still working on at our end. We are
waiting for a letter from Sun to put on our website to OEMs. We are also
in the process of updating our OEM license agreement. This should be
available by mid-April.

We have received a positive response from the FreeBSD community
regarding the release of the binaries. We received a few requests to
support the FreeBSD 6.1/amd64 platform. We have decided to move forward
and support this too. We currently are working with a contractor to
provide Java support on 5.5/i386, 6.1/i386, and 6.1/amd64. Once 5.5 and
6.1 are released, we'll update the FreeBSD Foundation website with the
Java status. Regular updates to the website will continue.

OpenBSD packet filter - pf

  -------

Contact: Max Laier <mlaier@FreeBSD.org>

Work towards importing the upcoming OpenBSD 3.9 version of pf is
starting slowly. There are a couple of infrastructural changes (e.g.
interface groups) that need to be imported beforehand. This work is in
the final stage of progress.

A couple of bugfixes have happened since the last report and will be
available in FreeBSD 6.1/5.5. pf users are strongly encouraged to
upgrade to RELENG_6 as the version present in RELENG_5 is collecting
dust.

The schedule for BSDCan 2006 demonstrates just how strong and popular
BSDCan has become in a very short time. Three concurrent streams of
talks make sure that there is something for everyone. We provide high
quality talks at very affordable prices .

BSDCan is the biggest BSD event of 2006. Ask others who attended in past
years how much they enjoyed their time in Ottawa. Ask them who they met,
who they talked to, the contacts they made, the information they
learned.

Remember to bring your wife/husband/spouse/etc because we will have
things for them to do while you are attending the conference. Ottawa is
a fantastic tourist destination.

See you at BSDCan 2006!

Open tasks:

1.  Works in Progress - if you want to talk about your project for 5
    minutes, this is your chance. Get in touch with us ASAP to reserve
    your spot.
2.  We're looking for volunteers to help out just before and during the
    conference. Contact Dan at the above address.

Contact: Security Officer <security-officer@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Security Team <security-team@FreeBSD.org>

In March 2006, Marcus Alves Grando, George Neville-Neil, and Philip
Paeps joined the FreeBSD Security Team. The current Security Team
membership is published on the web site.

In the time since the last status report, eight security advisories have
been issued concerning problems in the base system of FreeBSD; of these,
three problems were in "contributed" code, while five were in code
maintained within FreeBSD. The Vulnerabilities and Exposures Markup
Language (VuXML) document has continued to be updated by the Security
Team and the Ports Committers documenting new vulnerabilities in the
FreeBSD Ports Collection; since the last status report, 50 new entries
have been added, bringing the total up to 686.

The following FreeBSD releases are supported by the FreeBSD Security
Team: FreeBSD 4.10, FreeBSD 4.11, FreeBSD 5.3, FreeBSD 5.4, and FreeBSD
6.0. Upon their release, FreeBSD 5.5 and FreeBSD 6.1 will also be
supported. The respective End of Life dates of supported releases are
listed on the web site; of particular note, FreeBSD 4.10 and FreeBSD 5.4
will cease to be supported at the end of May 2006.

Contact: Colin Percival <cperciva@FreeBSD.org>

Since 2003, I have introduced the (now quite widely used) FreeBSD Update
and Portsnap tools, but rarely had time to make improvements or add
requested features. Consequently, on March 30th, I sent email to the
freebsd-hackers, freebsd-security, and freebsd-announce lists announcing
that I was seeking funding to allow me to spend the summer working
full-time on these and my role as FreeBSD Security Officer. Assuming
that some cheques arrive as expected, I have reached my donation target
and will start work at the beginning of May.

Open tasks:

1.  The work which I'm aiming to do is listed at the URL above.
