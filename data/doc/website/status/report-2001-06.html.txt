Introduction

One of the benefits of the FreeBSD development model is a focus on
centralized design and implementation, in which the operating system is
maintained in a central repository, and discussed on centrally
maintained lists. This allows for a high level of coordination between
authors of various components of the system, and allows policies to be
enforced over the entire system, covering issues ranging from
architecture to style. However, as the FreeBSD developer community has
grown, and the rate of both mailing list traffic and tree modifications
has increased, making it difficult even for the most dedicated developer
to remain on top of all the work going on in the tree.

The FreeBSD Monthly Development Status Report attempts to address this
problem by providing a vehicle that allows developers to make the
broader community aware of their on-going work on FreeBSD, both in and
out of the central source repository. This is the first issue, and as
such is an experiment. For each project and sub-project, a one paragraph
summary is included, indicating progress since the last summary (in this
case, simply recent progress, as there have been no prior summaries).

This status report may be reproduced in whole or in part, as long as the
source is clearly identified and appropriate credit given.

Future Editions

Assuming there is some positive feedback on this idea, and that future
submissions get made such that there is content for future issues, the
goal is to release a development status report once a month. As such,
the next deadline will be July 31, 2001, with a scheduled publication
date in the first week of August. This will put the status report on a
schedule in line with the calendar, as well as providing a little over a
month until the next deadline, which will include a number of pertinent
events, including the Annual USENIX Technical Conference in Boston, MA.
Submissions should be e-mailed to:

Many submitters will want to wait until the last week of July so as to
provide the most up-to-date status report; however, submissions will be
accepted at any time prior to that date.

Binary Updater Project

Contact: Eric Melville <eric@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Murray Stokely <murray@FreeBSD.org>

The FreeBSD Binary Updater Project aims to provide a secure mechanism
for the distribution of binary updates for FreeBSD. This project is
complementary to the Open Packages and libh efforts and there should be
very little overlap with those projects. The system uses a client /
server mechanism that allows clients to install any known "profile" or
release of FreeBSD over the network. Where a specific profile might
contain a specific set of FreeBSD software to install, additional
packages, and configuration actions that make it more ideal for a
specific environment (ie FreeBSD 4.3 Secure Web Server Profile)

The system can currently be used to install a FreeBSD system or perform
the most simple of upgrades but many features are absent. In particular,
the client is in its infancy and much work remains to be done. We need
additional developers so please get in touch with us at
updater@osd.bsdi.com if you are interested in spending some cycles on
this.

CVSROOT script rewrite/tidy

Contact: Josef Karthauser <joe@FreeBSD.org>

I'm in the process of rewriting the CVSROOT/scripts to make them more
clean and configurable. A lot of other projects also use these and so it
makes sense to make them as easy to use in other environments as
possible.

Status: work in progress. There is now a configuration file, but not all
the scripts use it yet.

DEVFS

Contact: Poul-Henning Kamp <phk@FreeBSD.org>

Work is progressing on implementing true cloning devices in DEVFS. Brian
Somers and Poul-Henning Kamp are working to make if_tun the first truly
cloning driver in the system. Next will be the pty driver and the bpf
driver.

From July 1st DEVFS will be standard in -current.

digi driver

Contact: Brian Somers <brian@FreeBSD.org>

Added the digi driver. Initial work was done by John Prince
<johnp@knight-trosoft.com>, but all the modular stuff was done by me and
initial work on supporting Xe and Xi cards (ala dgb) was done by me. I'm
now awaiting an Xe card being sent from joerg@ (almost a donation) so
that I can get that side of things working properly.

Contact: Poul-Henning Kamp <phk@FreeBSD.org>

Ben Smithurst has written a "diskcheckd" daemon which will read all
sectors on the disks over a configured period. With recent increases in
disksizes it is by no means a given that disk read errors will be
discovered before they are fatal. This daemon will hopefully result in
the drive firmware being able to relocate bad sectors before they become
unreadable. This code is now committed to 5.0-CURRENT.

if_fxp driver

Contact: Jonathan Lemon <jlemon@FreeBSD.org>

In the last month (May-June), the new fxp driver was brought into
-stable. This new driver uses the common MII code, so support for new
PHYs is easy to add. Support for the new Intel 82562 chips was added.
The driver was updated to add VLAN support and a workaround for a bug
affecting Intel 815-based boards.

Java Project

Contact: Greg Lewis <glewis@eyesbeyond.com>

The FreeBSD Java Project has continued its "behind the scenes" work over
the last month. Progress was made both technically, with the help of
Bill Huey (of Wind River), on a port of JDK 1.3.1 and legally, with Nate
Williams continuing negotiations with Sun on a mutually acceptable
license to release a binary Java 2 SDK under. The JDK 1.2.2 port has
also seen some development, with a new patchset likely to be released
soon which includes JPDA and NetBSD support (the latter courtesy of
Scott Bartram).

          URL: http://kgi.sourceforge.net/
  ------- ----------------------------------

Contact: Nicolas Souchu <nsouch@fr.alcove.com>

The Kernel Graphics Interface project has worked for several years to
provide a framework for graphic drivers under Linux receiving input from
other groups like the UDI project. Currently the KGI core implementation
is quite settled, as is the driver coding model as a whole. Work is
being done to newbussify KGI and produce a kld, as part of a future
redesign of the graphics subsystem in FreeBSD. KGI will be an
alternative for graphic card producers that don't accept the XFree86
model of userland graphic adapters and will also provide accelerated
support for any other graphic alternative.

  ------- --------------------------------------------

Contact: Alexander Langer <alex@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Nathan Ahlstrom <nra@FreeBSD.org>

The libh project is a next generation sysinstall. It is written in C++
using QT for its graphical frontend and tvision for its console support.
The menus are scriptable via an embedded tcl interpreter. It has been
growing functionality quite a bit lately, including a new disklabel
editor. Current work is on installation scripts for CDROM, FTP, ...
installs as well as a fully functional standalone disk-partition and
label editor. The GUI API was extended a little and many bugs were
fixed. There seems to be some interest in i18n work.

Mount(2) API

Contact: Poul-Henning Kamp <phk@FreeBSD.org>

Maxime Henrion is working on implementing a new and more extensible
mount(2) systemcall, mainly to overcome the 32 bits for mountoptions
limit, secondary goal to make it possible to mount filesystems from
inside the kernel.

OLDCARD pccard implementation

Contact: Warner Losh <imp@FreeBSD.org>

In the last two months, the OLDCARD pccard implementation was rototilled
to within an inch of its life. Many new pci cardbus bridges were added.
Power handling was improved. PCI Card cardbus bridges are nearly
supported and should be committed in early June to the tree. This will
likely be the last major work done on OLDCARD. After pci cards are
supported, work will shift to improving NEWCARD.

PowerPC Port

Contact: Benno Rice <benno@FreeBSD.org>

The PowerPC port is proceeding well. All seems to be working in pmap.c
after a number of problems encountered where FreeBSD passes a vm_page_t
to a NetBSD-derived function that expects a vm_offset_t. Then after
debugging the atomic operations code, I'm now at the point where VM
appears to be initialized and it's now hanging while in
sys/kern/kern_malloc.c:kmeminit(). Progress continues. =)

Poul-Henning Kamp kicked off a drive to get our GNATS PR database
cleaned up so the wheat can be sorted from the chaff. Progress is good,
but there is still a lot of work to do. Give a hand if you can.
Remember: every unhandled PR is a pissed off contributor or user.

pseudofs

Contact: Dag-Erling Smorgrav <des@FreeBSD.org>

Pseudofs is a framework for pseudo-filesystems, like procfs and
linprocfs. The goal of pseudofs is twofold:

-   eliminate code duplication between (and within) procfs and linprocfs
-   isolate procfs and linprocfs from the complexities of the vfs system
    to simplify maintenance and further development.

Pseudofs has reached the point where it is sufficiently functional and
stable that linprocfs has been almost fully reimplemented on top of it;
the only bit that's missing is the proc/<pid>/mem file.

The primary to-do item for pseudofs right now is to add support for
writeable files (which are required for procfs, and are quite a bit less
trivial to handle than read-only files). In addition, pseudofs needs
either generic support for raw (non-sbuf'ed, possibly mmap'able) files,
or failing that, special-case code to handle proc/<pid>/mem.

Contact: Bruce A. Mah <bmah@FreeBSD.org>

RELNOTESng is the name I've given to the rewrite of the *.TXT files that
typically accompany a FreeBSD release. The information from these files
(which include, among other things, the release notes and the supported
hardware list) have been reorganized and converted to SGML. This helps
us produce the documentation in various formats, as well as facilitating
the maintenance of documentation for multiple architectures. This work
was recently committed to -CURRENT, and I intend to MFC it to 4-STABLE
before 4.4-RELEASE.

Contact: Bosko Milekic <bmilekic@FreeBSD.org>

mb_alloc is a new specialized allocator for mbufs and mbuf clusters.
Presently, it offers various important advantages over the old (status
quo) mbuf allocator, particularly for MP machines. Additionally, it is
designed with the possibility of future enhancements in mind.

Presently in initial review & testing stages, most of the code is
already written.

Contact: John Baldwin <jhb@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Jake Burkholder <jake@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: SMP Mailing list <smp@FreeBSD.org>

The SMPng project aims to provide multithreaded support for the FreeBSD
kernel. Currently the kernel still runs almost exclusively under the
Giant kernel lock. Recently, progress has been made in locking the
process group and session structures as well as file descriptors by
Seigo Tanimura-san. Alfred Perlstein has also added in a giant lock
around the entire virtual memory (VM) subsystem which will eventually be
split up into several smaller locks. The locking of the VM subsystem has
proved tricky, and some of the current effort is focused on finding and
fixing a few remaining bugs in on the alpha architecture.

Sparc64 Port

Contact: Jake Burkholder <jake@FreeBSD.org>

Work has (re)started on a port of FreeBSD to the UltraSPARC
architecture, specifically targeting PCI based workstations. Jake
Burkholder will be porting the kernel, and Ade Lovett has expressed an
interest in working on userland. Recent work on the project includes:

-   built a gnu cross toolchain targeting sparc64
-   obtained remote access to an ultra 5 development machine (thanks to
    emmy)
-   developed a minimal set of headers and source files to allow the
    kernel to be compiled and linked
-   implemented a mini-loader which relocates the kernel, maps it into
    the tlbs and calls it
-   nabbed Benno Rice's openfirmware console driver which allows printf
    and panic to work

At this point the kernel can be net-booted and prints the FreeBSD
copyright before calling code that is not yet implemented. I am
currently working on a design for the pmap module and plan to begin
implementation in the next few days.

TrustedBSD

  ------- ---------------------------------

Contact: Robert Watson <rwatson@FreeBSD.org>

The TrustedBSD Project seeks to improve the security of the FreeBSD
operating system by adding new security features, many derived from
common trusted operating system requirements. This includes Access
Control Lists (ACLs), Fine-grained Event Logging (Audit), Fine-grained
Privileges (Capabilities), Mandatory Access Control (MAC), and other
architecture features, including file system extended attributes, and
improved object labeling.

Individual feature status reports are documented separately below; in
general, basic features (such as EAs, ACLs, and kernel support for
Capabilities) will be initially available in 5.0-RELEASE, conditional on
specific kernel options. A performance-enhanced version of EAs is
currently being targeted at 6.0-RELEASE, along with an integrated
capability-aware userland, and MAC support.

TrustedBSD Capabilities

Contact: Thomas Moestl <tmm@FreeBSD.org>

The kernel part of the capability implementation is mostly finished; all
uses of suser() and suser_xxx() and nearly all comparisons of uid's with
0 have been converted to use the newly introduced cap_check() call. Some
details still need clarification. More documentation for this needs to
be done.

POSIX.2c-compatible getfcap and setfcap programs have been written.
Experimental capability support in su(1), login(1), install(1) and
bsd.prog.mk is being tested.

Support for capabilities, ACL's, capabilities and MAC labels in tar(1)
is being developed; only the capability part is tested right now.
Generic support for extended attributes is planned, this will require
extensions to the current EA interface, which are written and will
probably be committed to -CURRENT in a few weeks. A port of these
features to pax(1) is planned.

TrustedBSD MAC and Object Labeling

  ------- ---------------------------------
  Links

  ------- ---------------------------------

Contact: Robert Watson <rwatson@FreeBSD.org>

An initial prototype of a Mandatory Access Control implementation was
completed earlier this year, supporting Multi-Level Security, Biba
Integrity protection, and a more general jail-based access control
model. Based on that implementation, I'm now in the process of improving
the FreeBSD security abstractions to simplify both the implementation
and integration of MAC support, as well as increase the number of kernel
objects protected by both discretionary and mandatory protection
schemes. Generic object labeling introduces a structure not dissimilar
in properties to the kernel ucred structure, only it is intended to be
associated with kernel objects, rather than kernel subjects, permitting
the creation of generic security protection routines for objects. This
would allow the easy extension of procfs and devfs to support ACLs and
MAC, for example. A prototype is underway, with compiling and running
code and simple protections now associated with sysctl's.

Patches are now available to add ACL support to cp(1) and mv(1) along
with preliminary support for install(1). Ilmar's i18n patches for
getfacl(1) and setfacl(1) need to be updated for the last set of changes
and committed. Some other functional improvements are also in the
pipeline.
