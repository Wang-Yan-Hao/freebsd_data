Introduction

This report is about the rather quiet last quarter of 2005, with the
release of FreeBSD 6.0 and the holiday season things evolved in the
background. Nonetheless, most exciting projects hit the tree (or are
going to very soon).

Upcoming events, such as the release of FreeBSD 6.1/5.5 and the third
BSDCan conference with a big developer summit promise to provide a
busier start in 2006. The foundation for upcoming development, however,
are the projects that are described herein.

We hope that you find interesting projects to look at or work on. The
next status report collection will be April 7 2006. We are looking
forward to your report then.

Thanks again to everyone who submitted reports, and thanks to Brad Davis
who stepped up for an extensive spelling and grammar review. Enjoy
reading!

Development is going on after the complete rewrite of the toolkit. There
are many plugins available and we're testing a new implementation of
unionfs for 6.x. Since it's a bit unstable, it won't be included in the
release anyway. Developers hope to enter the BETA state on February 1st,
to release an -RC image around February 15th and the RELEASE around
March 1st. We need more people to test the images we provide. Torrents
for them are available at torrent.freesbie.org .

Open tasks:

1.  A new BETA Release, based on 6-STABLE, is available for testing.

jemalloc

  -------

Contact: Jason Evans <jasone@FreeBSD.org>

libc's malloc implementation has been replaced with an implementation
that is designed to scale well for multi-threaded applications running
on multi-processor systems. This is accomplished by creating multiple
allocation arenas that are independent of each other, and permanently
assigning threads to these arenas. In the common case, threads do not
access the same allocator arena at the same time, which reduces
contention and cache sloshing.

Single-threaded application performance is approximately equivalent to
what it was with phkmalloc, but for multi-threaded applications that
make heavy use of malloc, the performance difference can be huge (orders
of magnitude).

As with phkmalloc, the new malloc implementation supports runtime
configuration via the MALLOC_OPTIONS environment variable. See the
malloc(3) manpage for details on supported options, as well as more
information about the allocator's architecture.

The port of DragonFly's variant symlinks ( project ideas ) to FreeBSD.
Variant symlinks is a dynamic symbolic link implementation. Source file
of a variant symlink may contain one or more variable names. Each of
these variable names is enclosed in braces and preceded by a dollar sign
in the style of variable references in sh(1). Whenever a variant symlink
is followed, each variable found in source file is replaced by its
associated value. In this manner, a variant symlink may resolve to
different paths based on context.

Open tasks:

1.  Document a new system calls.
2.  More testing.
3.  Write the rc.d script for the variant symlinks initialization.

The "TODO list for volunteers" is now committed as the "FreeBSD list of
projects and ideas for volunteers". So far the interest in the list is
high and some volunteers already took the opportunity to start tackling
some of the entries.

Unfortunately the FreeBSD project does not have enough human resources
to provide a technical contact for every entry. Interested volunteers
should not be afraid to try to come up with a solution for an entry
without a technical contact. The people on the hackers and current
mailing list are typically very helpful regarding answering specific
questions (as long as they know the answer...).

We are looking forward to hear about new ideas, people willing to be
technical contacts for generic topics (e.g. USB) or specific entries
(already existing or newly created), suggestions for existing entries or
completion reports for (parts of) an entry.

Open tasks:

1.  Add more ideas.
2.  Find more technical contacts.

The experiment to add 'tags' to many of the kern and related PRs,
including such things as '[nfs]', '[fxp]', and so forth, continues. In
addition, PRs with patches have been more consistently tagged with
'[patch]'. Two new periodic reports based on both functional tags and
PRs with patches have been added, with the goal of making these PRs more
visible.

This report covers the period July 2005 - January 2006, since the
FreeBSD Security Team did not submit a status report for July - October
2005.

In August 2005, the long-time Security Officer, Jacques Vidrine, stepped
down and was replaced by Colin Percival. Jacques remains with the team
as Security Officer Emeritus, and the team thanks him for all his work
over the past four years.

Also in August 2005, Dag-Erling C. SmÃ¸rgrav was replaced by Simon L.
Nielsen as Deputy Security Officer. In addition, Tom Rhodes and Guido
van Rooij retired from the team in September 2005 and January 2006
respectively in order to devote their time to other parts of the FreeBSD
project. The current Security Team membership is published on the web
site.

In the time since the last status report, ten security advisories have
been issued (five in 2005, five in 2006) concerning problems in the base
system of FreeBSD; of these, four problems were in "contributed" code,
while six were in code maintained within FreeBSD. The Vulnerabilities
and Exposures Markup Language (VuXML) document has continued to be
updated by the Security Team and the Ports Committers documenting new
vulnerabilities in the FreeBSD Ports Collection; since the last status
report, 117 new entries have been added, bringing the total up to 636.

The following FreeBSD releases are supported by the FreeBSD Security
Team: FreeBSD 4.10, FreeBSD 4.11, FreeBSD 5.3, FreeBSD 5.4, and FreeBSD
6.0. Their respective End of Life dates are listed on the web site.

During this time, the number of ports PRs briefly dipped below 500 -- a
number not seen since late 2000, when there were 4000 ports instead of
our new total of over 14,000 ports. This is due to the hard work of a
large number of individuals, including pav, edwin, mnag, garga, and many
others. Congratulations folks! Some of this was due to more aggressively
committing PRs where the maintainer had not responded within the timeout
period. Although controversial, this new policy seems to be succeeding
in its goal of improving the Ports Collection.

A new file, ports/KNOBS, was added by ahze to help bring some order in
the chaos that had been the OPTIONS namespace.

dougb has changed the way that rc.d works in -HEAD to work more like the
base rc.d scripts. We are hoping that this change will make ports
maintenance easier in the future. However, in the meantime a few bugs
have been introduced (which we intend to have fixed by the time 6.1 is
released). While this regression is unfortunate, it was decided that now
was the best time to try to make this change rather than waiting for
7.0. We hope our users can be patient with us in the interim.

Work continues to improve the marcuscom ports tinderbox, with new
features added by marcus, aDe, and edwin in particular. Several ports
committers are now running their own copies to test ports changes.

The www.FreeBSD.org/ports page, and the portmgr web pages, were reworked
as well.

We have added 4 new committers since the last report.

Open tasks:

1.  Progress has been made in cracking down on ports that do not
    correctly install when LOCALBASE is not /usr/local, but some ports
    remain.
2.  portmgr would like to remind committers that PRs for their ports
    should be handled (either committed or marked 'suspended' or
    'analyzed') within the two week timeout period. In this way other
    committers do not have to invoke the maintainer timeout and things
    will work more smoothly.

Another very busy year for the FreeBSD Release Engineering Team.
Recognizing the problems, both technical and emotional, surrounding the
FreeBSD 5.x releases, our primary focus was in getting the bugs out of
FreeBSD 6.0 and getting it released. We succeeded at that quite well,
and the 6.0 release on Nov 18 was a huge success for the project. Many
thanks to all of the developers who put in countless hours fixing bugs
and improving performance, and to the users who helped find, fix, and
verify bugs.

Moving forward to 2006, we plan on doing a joint release of FreeBSD 5.5
and 6.1 in late March. The 5.5 release will mark the end of active
FreeBSD 5.x development and releases, and is intended to help users who
have not yet switched to FreeBSD 6. It consists primarily of bug fixes
and minor improvements. FreeBSD 6.1 will be an upgrade to 6.0 and will
include new drivers, better performance in certain areas, as well as bug
fixes. We expect to release FreeBSD 6.2 and 6.3 later in 2006.

Bt878 Audio Driver (aka FusionHDTV 5 Lite)

Basic audio capture is working. All of the parameters are set by
userland, while the RISC program generation is by kernel. No real audio
has been captured as there are no drivers for the tuner yet. Someone
with a real Bt878 NTSC card that is supported by bktr(4) could use this
to capture audio w/o using the sound card.

The real goal of this driver is to make HD capture possible with the
DViCO FusionHDTV5 Lite card that I have. I have some of the
documentation that I need, but I'm still missing two key docs. The docs
for the LGDT3303 ATSC/8VSB/QAM demodulator chip and a block diagram of
the board showing which GPIO lines go where and how the chips are
interconnected. DViCO has been responsive in acknowledging my emails,
but they have yet to produced any data besides pointing me to the Linux
driver (which is difficult to figure out stuff by).

Open tasks:

1.  Complete basic capture driver.
2.  Make the bktr(4) drive cleanly attach to the card, and possibly add
    support for analog capture.

E1000 driver improvements

  -------

  -------

Contact: Scott Long <scottl@freebsd.org>
Contact: Andre Opperman <andre@freebsd.org>

In an effort to solve the 'interrupt aliasing' problem that plagues many
motherboards under FreeBSD, I modified the Intel e1000 network driver
(if_em) to use a combination of fast interrupts and taskqueues. This
technique avoids interrupt threads entirely, which in turn avoids
triggering the aliasing problem in the Intel APIC. The result is that
the driver now handles and masks interrupts immediately, and a private
taskqueue is then scheduled to run to process the link events and rx/tx
events. A side effect of this asynchronous processing is that it acts
much as traditional polling does, in that the amount of work done in the
taskqueue can be controlled, and the taskqueue rescheduled to process
work at a later time. This leads to the driver having the low-latency
benefits of interrupts and the workload segmentation of polling, all
without complicated heuristics. Several users have reported that the
driver can handle higher loads than traditional polling without
deadlocks.

Along with this work, I modified the SMPng locking in the driver so that
no lock is required for the RX path. Since this path is already
implicitly serialized by the interrupt and/or taskqueue and/or polling
handler (all of which are exclusive to each other), there was no need
for extra synchronization. This has two benefits. The first is reduction
in processing overhead to unlock and lock the driver for every RX
packet, and significant reduction in contention of the driver lock when
transmitting and receiving packets at the same time. I believe that it
is further possible to run the TX-complete path without a lock, further
reducing overhead and contention for high transmit loads. The reduced
contention also greatly benefited the fast-forward bridging code in
FreeBSD, with up to 25% performance improvement seen, as well as lower
CPU utilization.

The work can be found in FreeBSD 7-CURRENT for now. There are still some
rough edges relating to falling back to traditional ithread and polling
behavior, and I do not intend to merge the changes back to FreeBSD 6.x
until these are resolved. I also hope to extend the INTR_FAST+taskqueue
model into a general framework for doing Mac OSX style filter
interrupts. The work in the if_em driver can also be extended to other
high-performance network drivers such as if_bge and if_ti. Any help with
investigating these topics is welcomed.

LSI MegaRAID improvements

Contact: Scott Long <scottl@freebsd.org>
Contact: Doug Ambrisko <ambrisko@freebsd.org>

Major work has gone into improving both the performance of the LSI
MegaRAID (amr) driver, and in adding Linux compatibility support. SMPng
locking was added in Oct 2005 as well as a number of performance
improvements. The result is 138% performance improvement in some local
transaction tests.

Throughout 2005 a lot of work has gone into adding Linux compatibility
to the driver. It is now possible to run many of the LSI-provided
management apps for Linux under FreeBSD. Both this feature and the
performance improvements are in the 7-CURRENT development branch of
FreeBSD and are scheduled to be backported in time for the FreeBSD 6.1
release.

A lot of changes have taken place in the sound system since the last
status report. They range from less hiccups and distortion by disk
accesses and/or driver bugs to new and improved features (software
volume control implemented for soundcards which do not have hardware
volume control). Additionally a new driver (snd_atiixp) has seen the
light and a lot of problem reports were fixed.

Most of those changes and the changes mentioned in the previous status
report are already merged to RELENG_6 and will be part of 6.1-RELEASE.

Open tasks:

1.  Have a look at the sound related entries on the ideas list.
2.  Rewrite some parts (e.g. a new mixer subsystem with OSS
    compatibility).
3.  sndctl(1): tool to control non-mixer parts of the sound system (e.g.
    spdif switching, virtual-3D effects) by an user (instead of the
    sysctl approach in -current); pcmplay(1), pcmrec(1), pcmutil(1).
4.  Plugable FEEDER infrastructure. For ease of debugging various feeder
    stuff and/or as userland library and test suite.
5.  Support for new hardware (envy24, Intel HDA).
6.  Performance enhancement (via 'slave'-channels).
7.  Closer compatibility with OSS, especially for the upcoming OSS v4.

Based on the Kame-Shisa Mobile IPv6 Software for FreeBSD 5.4, we
implemented the performance optimization "Early Binding Updates" and
"Credit-Based Authorization". The combined optimizations facilitate
significant reductions in handoff delay without compromising protocol
security [1][2].

Currently splitting out the rest of the PF_KEY data-structures from the
key database. This will mean the user level applications and the kernel
will not share datastructures and that they can, hopefully, advance on
their own without being in lockstep.

Open tasks:

1.  Calculate diffs between Kame IPv4 version of IPSec and FAST_IPSEC
    and upgrade FAST to the latest standards.
2.  Add IPv6 support to FAST_IPSEC.

Most of the latest KAME code has been merged to 7-current and 6-stable,
to prepare for the project conclusion in March 2006. For the same
reason, we moved some ports applications (security/racoon, net/pim6sd,
net/pim6dd, net/dhcp6) from KAME to sourceforge.net.

Some of the items (e.g. IGMPv3/MLDv2, Mobile-IPv6/NEMO, SCTP, DCCP,
ISATAP) are not merged yet from the latest KAME code for several
reasons. Other projects will continue to merge their work.

Open tasks:

1.  remove __P() macros
2.  set net.inet6.ip6.kame_version to a more appropriate date :-)
3.  update src/sys/netinet6/README

FreeBSD 6 has evolved drastically in the development branch since
FreeBSD 5.3 and especially so in the network area. The presentation and
paper give an in-depth overview of all network stack related
enhancements, changes and new code with a narrative on their rationale.

FreeBSD has gained fine grained locking in the network stack throughout
the 5.x-RELEASE series cumulating in 6.0-RELEASE. Hardware architecture
and performance characteristics have evolved significantly since various
BSD networking subsystems have been designed and implemented. This paper
gives a detailed look into the implementation and design changes in
FreeBSD 7-CURRENT to extract the maximum network performance from the
underlying hardware.

Userland programs

OpenBSD dhclient

  -------

Contact: Brooks Davis <brooks@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Sam Leffler <sam@FreeBSD.org>

The OpenBSD rewrite of dhclient has been imported, replacing the ISC
dhclient. The OpenBSD client provides better support for roaming on
wireless networks and a simpler model of operation. Instead of a single
dhclient process per system, there is one per network interface. This
instance automatically goes away in the even of link loss and is
restarted via devd when link is reacquired. To support this change, many
aspects of the network interface configuration process were overhauled.

Support for adding aliases to DHCP configured interfaces has been
committed to CURRENT and will be merged before 6.1-RELEASE. Soon work
will begin to merge changes from OpenBSD that have taken place since the
initial import.

Work on further interface configuration enhancements is underway for
FreeBSD 7.0.

Contact: Kip Macy <kip.macy@gmail.com>

Full domU support in p4 branch of -CURRENT, except suspend / restore.
Dom0 work is in progress. Scott Long is working on xenbus integration
with newbus. After newbus integration it will go into CVS. I hope to see
it MFCed to RELENG_6 so it will be available for 6.1.

Open tasks:

1.  Port the backend drivers from Linux.
2.  Port the domain management tools from Linux.
3.  Add multiboot support to loader(8) to support it booting xen.
4.  SMP, x86_64, and PAE support.

FreeBSD/xbox support is nearing completion. Patches are available for
nve(4) ethernet support, as well as a syscons(4)-capable console. I am
working to integrate these in CURRENT, a backport to 6.x is planned too.

Work is under way to support X.Org as well; people with more detailed
knowledge of X.Org are welcome to assist.

Open tasks:

1.  Enable framebuffer support in X.Org
2.  Figure out a way to use mfsroots without using loader(8)

Contact: Dan Langille <dan@langille.org>

FreshPorts recently moved to a new webserver. This should speed things
up considerably.

You can read all about the new hardware on the recently introduced
FreshPorts Blog . This blog will include technical discussions about
ports and the problems they present with respect to FreshPorts. Site
announcements will be posted there. As bugs are found, they will be
listed, as well as their fixes.

Supporting multiple platforms and architectures is still in the
development stage. Lack of time is affecting progress.

A fix for virtual ports is in the works. I'm also going to implement
more caching to speed things up. If interested in discussing the options
there, please get involved in the blog.

Optimizations to reduce handoff delays inherent in Mobile IPv6 Route
Optimization as well as IPv6 router discovery, address configuration,
and movement detection have so far been mostly considered on an
individual basis. This document evaluates three integrated solutions for
improved handoff experience in surroundings with different
preconditions: reactive handoffs with unmodified routers, reactive
handoffs with router support, and movement anticipation and proactive
handoff management.

Contact: Dan Langille <dan@langille.org>

We are well into the process of selecting the talks for BSDCan 2006. Our
new program committee has a hard selection task over the new few weeks.
The deadline for the Call For Papers has passed, but it's not too late
to submit a talk. Please see the above URL for details. After the
success of the Work in Progress last year , we are going to do it again
this year. If you are working on something you'd like to tell the world
about, considering giving a 5 minute talk at BSDCan. The registration
prices for BSDCan 2006 will be the same as they were for 2005 . We will
be again in the SITE building at University of Ottawa and you'll have
lots of opportunity to meet with people from all over the world. Be sure
to make your travel plans now and don't miss out on the biggest BSD
event this year: BSDCan 2006.

Open tasks:

1.  We're looking for volunteers to help out just before and during the
    conference. Contact Dan at the above address.
2.  If you have a talk you'd like to present, contact Dan at the above
    address.

The fundraiser has been very successful and I want to thank everyone who
has pledged their support and tipped the jar. The full amount plus a
little bit more has been raised in a very short timeframe. More
information on the exact amounts and their sponsors can be found at the
first link.

After the delays on this project caused by the FreeBSD 6.0 Release cycle
code freeze work has picked up and a paper was written and a
presentation held on "Optimizing the FreeBSD IP and TCP Stack" for
EuroBSDCon 05 on November 27th. See related status report under that
title.

From December 21st to January 11th I received access to a calibrated
Agilent N2X gigabit tester and traffic generator. Stock FreeBSD
7-current was tested and profiled extensively in this timeframe. A first
proof of concept optimization was developed in cooperation with Scott
Long. It involved converting the Intel Gigabit ethernet em(4) driver to
make use of fast interrupt handlers, taskqueues and lockless RX ring
handling. This improved the performance from 570kpps to 750kpps, a 25%
improvement, with IP fastforwarding enabled.

Open tasks:

1.  A large number of profiles and measurements was taken and a detailed
    report on the performance characteristics and remaining bottlenecks
    is under preparation.
2.  Further optimizations and new features described on the Optimization
    Fundraiser page.
