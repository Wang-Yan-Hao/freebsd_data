Introduction

Last month's status report was apparently a great success: I received
countless e-mails with comments, questions, and suggestions. I've tried
to incorporate any suggestions and address any problems from these
e-mails in this month's report, which captures a far more extensive
snapshot of FreeBSD activity in the last month. Unlike last month's
report, it does a better job of reflecting non-development activity,
such as on-going conference planning, documentation, and so on. This is
a trend I hope to see improve in future months as well.

On the topic of conferences, in the future I'd like to report more on
publication activities relating to FreeBSD, including online journals
with articles relating to FreeBSD, paper journals, conference papers,
and so on. Likewise, I would be interested in including references to
Call for Papers relating to FreeBSD. I'll take this opportunity to plug
both registration and paper submission for BSDCon Europe in November,
which has status included in this report, and for the general BSD
Conference being hosted by USENIX in February. Your attendance and
submissions make these conferences "happen", and promote FreeBSD as a
platform for new research, feature development, and application
products. Work of extremely high calibre is performed on FreeBSD, and we
need to get the word out.

Submission for Future Editions

Next month, we're maintaining much the same submission requirements:
reports should be one or two paragraphs long, sent by e-mail, and
approximate the layout of the entries this month (Project, Contact, URL,
and text). I'll send out reminders again over the week before the
deadline, with more specific instructions. An area where I'd like to
explore improvement lies in the coordination of related status reports
for larger projects, such as new architectural work or platform ports.
This might even have the effect of encouraging communication within
these projects :-). I'd like to continue to focus on pulling in a
broader range of groups and their activities, including the Security
Officer, Release Engineer, and Core Team.

ACPI

Contact: Mike Smith <msmith@FreeBSD.org>

ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) is an industry
standard which obsoletes APM, Intel MPS, PnPBIOS, and other Intel PC
firmware interface standards. It is also used on the IA64 platform. More
information on ACPI is available at

http://developer.intel.com/technology/iapc/acpi

The FreeBSD ACPI subsystem project is based heavily on the Intel ACPI
Component Architecture. This status report outlines the current state of
the project; future updates will focus on changes as they occur.

The Intel ACPI interpreter is fully integrated, although bugs are still
coming out of the woodwork occasionally.

-   PCI bus detection and interrupt routing are functional, but power
    management interaction will require work on the core PCI subsystem.
-   Non-PCI motherboard peripheral probing is implemented, but believed
    to have problems on some systems.
-   A power policy manager has been implemented. The initial policy
    manager has two modes, "performance" and "economy".
-   CPU speed throttling is integrated with the platform power policy.
-   System thermal monitoring is implemented, but fan control is
    believed to have problems.
-   Pushbutton suspend and power-off is implemented.
-   System timekeeping using the ACPI timer is supported.
-   Battery status monitoring is implemented.

Work is ongoing in the following areas:

-   System suspend and resume.
-   Timekeeper accuracy/reliability.
-   Power profiles.
-   User-level management interfaces.
-   PCI power management.
-   Bug-hunting.

ARM Port

Contact: Stephane Potvin <septovin@videotron.ca>

The ARM port is currently going pretty well. The kernel is compiling and
is able to boot to the point where it panics trying to initialize the
network subsystem. The current reference platform is the Netwinder but
this may change as many people expressed interest in a more broadly
available platform. Things that need to be done before it can get
further includes adding footbridge, timer and interrupt supports. The
pmap module is not completed yet either.

BIND 9

Contact: Doug Barton <dougb@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Jeroen Ruigrok <asmodai@FreeBSD.org>

Now that BIND 8.2.4 is finally imported the time has come to look at
getting BIND 9 imported into CURRENT. The current idea is to have it
imported alongside BIND 8 so that people can play with either one until
all import problems have been taken care of and people have tested it a
bit.

binup

Contact: Eric Melville <eric@FreeBSD.org>

Although gaining a new name, the project has been at a standstill due to
both resource availability during the move between BSDi and Wind River,
and other commitments of the developers. The project should obtain an
official mailing list, as well as return to an active state after the
dust settles.

  ------- ----------------------------------

Contact: Paul Richards <paul@freebsd-services.co.uk>
Contact: Josef Karthauser <joe@tao.org.uk>

The conference will take place at the Thistle Hotel, Brighton, UK from
9-11 November 2001.

The aim of the conference is to provide a focal point for European users
and developers of all the BSD derived operating systems. The format will
be similar to other conferences, with 2 days of technical sessions over
the Saturday and Sunday.

We'll be finalizing the schedule towards the end of the month and
anybody who is interested in doing a talk should contact us ASAP. There
are no restrictions on the use of talks; if it's been done before we may
still be interested in having it presented to an European audience, and
we make no claims to the talks so speakers are free to present the talks
again at other conferences.

We're also still looking for sponsors.

We had 80 pre-registrations in the first week so we're expecting a good
turnout.

CAM

Contact: Matthew Jacob <mjacob@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Justin Gibbs <gibbs@FreeBSD.org>

The new CAM transport code is starting to get supported in more HBAs and
to get refined so that it does the intended per-protocol support. No
progress on doing any SMPng work for CAM has been made yet. This is a
fairly high priority.

Contact: Documentation Project <doc@FreeBSD.org>

Work continues (in large part sponsored by WRS) on updating the Handbook
ready for the second print edition. There has been a flurry of activity
in this area recently, and the ToDo list can be seen at

http://www.FreeBSD.org/docproj/handbook.html

Dima and others are doing a stellar job of keeping up with the steady
flow of incoming PRs relating to the documentation project.

The Developers' Handbook,

http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/developers-handbook/index.html

is a year old; it contains a wealth of useful content for developers
developing on, or for, FreeBSD. As ever, more contributions are always
required, not only for the developers' handbook, but for all of the
FreeBSD documentation set.

Fibre Channel Support

Contact: Matthew Jacob <mjacob@feral.com>

The basic design hasn't changed and this project mainly is in the phase
of continued hardening and test case development. The next major feature
will be to fully integrate into the new CAM TRAN code and to fully
support on the fly device addition and removal. The only HBA supported
is QLogic at this time. Future support for the QLogic line is planned to
have 2300 (2Gb) and IP support before October.

  ------- -----------------------------------

Contact: Greg Lewis <glewis@eyesbeyond.com>

The main development in the FreeBSD Java Project over the last month was
the release of an initial "Developers Only" patchset for the JDK 1.3.1.
Since that release progress had been made towards a much more usable
alpha quality patchset which is likely to be turned into a port, as per
the current JDK 1.2.2 patchset. This new patchset will feature a number
of bugfixes, which essentially get the JDK to a working state for early
adopters, and an initial implementation of "native threads" based on
FreeBSD's userland pthreads. Unfortunately this implementation isn't
fully functional, but is included in the hope of getting more eyeballs
on the code (particularly experienced pthread programmers). We'd also
like to welcome Fuyuhiko Maruyama-san as a new committer, the usual
punishment for too many good patches.

The FreeBSD Monthly Development Status Report aims to keep users and
developers up-to-date on the latest goings-on in the FreeBSD project by
providing summaries of each project and its status. At the time of this
writing, the July 2001 status report is being prepared and is very near
release. The FreeBSD Web site now has a Status Reports section, which,
when the July 2001 report is released, will be updated to include a link

FreeBSD/sparc64 kernel loader

Contact: Robert Drehmel <robert@ferrari.de>

The sparc64 loader is functional enough to boot an ELF binary from an
UFS filesystem using the existent openfirmware library, which has been
revised to work flawlessly on 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. Support
for netbooting and modules will be implemented next, followed by a
better openfirmware mapping strategy.

Hardware Watchpoints in the Kernel Debugger

Contact: Brian Dean <bsd@FreeBSD.org>

Hardware watchpoints are now available for kernel debugging on the IA32
(i386) architecture. One can now set hardware watchpoints using the new
ddb command 'hwatch', which is analogous to the existing 'watch'
command. Alternatively, if greater flexibility is required, direct
access to the debug registers is available using the ddb 'set' command
which allows complete control over the processor hardware debug
facilities. Hardware watchpoints are very useful in tracking down those
elusive memory overwrite bugs in the kernel. Hardware watchpoints can
even be used to set a code breakpoint in ROM, which is commonly found in
embedded systems.

ifconfig support for IEEE 802.11 wireless devices

Contact: Brooks Davis <brooks@FreeBSD.org>

Support for configuring IEEE 802.11 wireless devices via ifconfig has
been committed to -current and -stable. It contains most of the
functionality needed to configure an wireless device. Some missing
features are being worked on including integrated support for DHCP so a
single entry in /etc/rc.conf can be used to fully configure a wireless
device on a DHCP lan and setting the CTS/RTS threshold. Currently the
an(4) and wi(4) drivers are supported in -current and -stable with the
awi(4) device supported in -current. Further work is needed to support
Frequency Hopping devices such as ray(4).

jailNG

Contact: Robert Watson <rwatson@FreeBSD.org>

jailNG is a from-scratch rewrite of the popular jail(8) service,
focusing on improved management functions, as well as more fine-grained
configurability. An initial prototype has been written, based on
explicitly named and configured jails, and work is proceeding on
userland integration. Currently, it's not clear if the timeline for this
will be 5.0-RELEASE, or 5.1-RELEASE.

KSE threading the kernel

  Links   
          URL: http://people.FreeBSD.org/~jasone/kse/
  ------- ---------------------------------------------

Contact: Julian Elischer <julian@elischer.org>

I'm working on multithreading the kernel. So far I have over 400KB of
diffs relative to today's -current (I'm keeping my tree updated with
changes as they occur rather than get hit with a big update at the end).

I have split the proc structure and am changing most of the kernel to
pass around a thread identifier instead of a proc structure.

The following interfaces have been changed so far:

-   device devsw entries
-   vfs calls
-   mutexes
-   events
-   system calls
-   scheduler
-   + a lot of code in between.

I have still a lot of work to go with a lot of "dumb editing" (s/struct
proc \*p/struct thread \*td/) usually I change a few items and then fix
everything that breaks when I try compile it. I'd like to check it in on
a branch so others can help the editing but haven't worked out the best
way to do it yet.

I have implemented changes to the scheduler so that KSE's are scheduled
instead of processes, and threads sleep, letting the KSE pick up a new
thread. but it's not anywhere ready yet (heck it doesn't compile yet :-)

Note that I have not yet updated the document listed above.. everywhere
it mentions "ksec" or "KSE-context", the code uses the word "thread". I
will update it soon as Jason has sent me the source.

NetBSD rc.d port

  ------- -----------------------------------------------

Contact: Doug Barton <dougb@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Sheldon Hearn <sheldonh@FreeBSD.org>

The NetBSD rc.d port aims to improve the FreeBSD startup process by
porting Luke Mewburn's rc.d work from NetBSD to FreeBSD. This will score
FreeBSD startup and shutdown dependencies without losing the traditional
and much loved monolithic configuration filesystem.

Luke Mewburn's USENIX paper and slides on the system as implemented in
NetBSD are available here:

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/FreeBSD-rc/message/3

Interested parties are urged to study this material before joining the
discussion list.

The intention at this stage is to decide on an approach that will ensure
that the differences between the NetBSD rc.d system and the system as
ported to FreeBSD will be kept to a minimum. This will probably involve
discussions with Luke around those areas of the system that are
identified as areas for potential improvement.

Netgraph ATM

Contact: Hartmut Brandt <brandt@fokus.gmd.de>

The goal of this project is the implementation of ATM signalling and
other ATM protocols by means of the netgraph(4) framework. This should
provide an easily extensible architecture for using ATM on FreeBSD.
Currently the full UNI4.0 stack (except for the LIJ capability) has been
implemented, including ILMI and a first version of the ATM Forum API for
UNI. An implementation of Classical IP over ATM is also available.
Drivers have been implemented for the Fore PCA200E and Fore HE-155
cards.

network device cloning

Contact: Brooks Davis <brooks@FreeBSD.org>

Network device cloning support has been imported from NetBSD. This
allows virtual devices to be allocated on demand rather then being
statically allocated at compile time. Our implementation differs
slightly from that of NetBSD's in that we allow both the creation of
specific devices (i.e. gif0) and arbitrary devices instead of just
allowing specific devices. Currently, the only device in the tree which
has been converted is the gif(4) device which has been converted in both
-current and -stable. Work is ongoing to convert all other virtual
network devices with work in progress on faith, stf, and vlan
interfaces. In general this conversion is accompanied by appropriate
modifications to make these devices fully modular.

PRFW is a set of hooks which I have integrated into the FreeBSD kernel.
This allows modules to easily intercept system calls with less overhead.
It also supports per-pid restrictions, which means, one process may not
be able to use X function in Y manner, but another process may.

Progress: I was working on this in 4.3-RELEASE, but now I'm merging it
into current. I will be submitting a patch to the mailing lists in about

Contact: John Baldwin <jhb@FreeBSD.org>

Development

In the 'smpng' p4 branch there is code to make the ast() function loop
to close the race when an AST is triggered while we are handling
previously triggered AST's.

In the 'jhb_preemption' p4 branch work is being done to make the kernel
fully preemptive. It is reportedly stable on UP x86, but SMP x86 locks
up, UP alpha has problems during shutdown and can recurse indefinitely
until it exhausts its stack.

Management

We are using a perforce repository for live development work, which can
track multiple separate long-lived works-in-progress and collaborate
between multiple developers at the same time on the same change set.

FreeBSD-current is being imported into p4 hourly, for easy tracking of
the moving -current tree.

I haven't written up a good primer yet, but we're able to open this up
to the general developer community. NEWCARD work looks like it will be
done here too. Perforce is ideal for tracking this sort of long-lived
project without having to resort to passing patches around.

KSE work is now being checked into a kse p4 branch - thanks Julian!

KSE work is focusing on getting the main API changes into the base tree
well before 5.0.

SMPng mbuf allocator

Contact: Bosko Milekic <bmilekic@FreeBSD.org>

mb_alloc is a specialized allocator for mbufs and mbuf clusters. It
offers various important advantages over the old mbuf allocator,
particularly for MP machines. Additionally, it is designed with the
possibility of important future enhancements in mind.

The mb_alloc code has been committed to -CURRENT a month ago and appears
to be holding up well. Prior to committing it, preliminary performance
measurements were done merely to ensure that it is not significantly
worse than the old allocator, even with Giant still in place. Results
were promising
[http://people.FreeBSD.org/~bmilekic/code/mb_alloc/results.html] - also
see jlemon's results (link at the bottom of accompanying text). Since
the commit, Matt Jacob has provided useful feedback and bugfixes. Work
is now being done to re-enable mbtypes statistics and make appropriate
changes to netstat(1) and systat(1).

sparc64 port

Contact: Jake Burkholder <jake@FreeBSD.org>

The sparc64 port has been committed to the FreeBSD repository. As such
further development will occur in cvs, rather than as a separately
maintained patch set. Significant progress has been made since the last
status report, including; support for kernel debugging with ddb, much
more complete pmap support, support for context switching and process
creation, and filling out of important machine dependent data
structures. Thomas Moestl has shown a strong interest in working on the
port and is in the process of implementing support for saving and
restoring a process's floating point context. I look forward to working
with him and any other developers that happen to fall out of the wood
works.

SYN cache implementation for FreeBSD

Contact: Jonathan Lemon <jlemon@FreeBSD.org>

This project brings a SYN cache implementation to FreeBSD, in order to
make it more robust to DoS attacks. A SYN cookie approach was
considered, but ultimately rejected because it does not conform to the
TCP protocol. The SYN cache will work with T/TCP, IPV6 and IPSEC, and
the size of each cache element is currently is less than 1/5th the size
of a normal TCP control block.

Contact: Robert Watson <rwatson@FreeBSD.org>

It's been a busy month, with a number of relevant news items. Not least
important is that NAI Labs was awarded a $1.2M contract from the US
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to work on a variety
of components relevant to the TrustedBSD Project, including support for
pluggable security models, and supporting features such as improving the
extended attributes implementation, simple crypto support for swap and
filesystems, documentation, and much more.

On the features side, progress continues on Mandatory Access Control,
object labeling, and improving the consistency of kernel access control
mechanisms--in particular, with regard to inter-process authorization
and credential management. Work has begun on porting LOMAC, NAI Labs'
Low-Watermark Mandatory Access Control scheme, from Linux to FreeBSD,
and it has been re-licensed under a BSD license. We hope to have an
initial port complete in time for 5.0-RELEASE later this year.
