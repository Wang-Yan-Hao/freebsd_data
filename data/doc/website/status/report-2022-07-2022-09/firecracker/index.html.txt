FreeBSD/Firecracker

Links:
Firecracker VM

Contact: Colin Percival <cperciva@FreeBSD.org>

Firecracker is an open source "microVM" developed by Amazon Web
Services; it is designed for the needs of "serverless" compute
environments and has a particular focus on security and minimalism.

Starting in June 2022, Colin Percival has been working to port FreeBSD
to run in the Firecracker environment, with significant assistance from
other FreeBSD developers. As of this quarterly report, a set of patches
are pending review which collectively add the needed support to make
FreeBSD functional in a patched version of Firecracker.

In Q4 Colin intends to finish committing the relevant patches to
FreeBSD, release a kernel and disk image so other FreeBSD users can
experiment with Firecracker, and update and merge Firecracker patches
which add PVH boot support (used by FreeBSD).

This work has already produced "spinoff" benefits in revealing ways to
speed up the FreeBSD boot process; due to its low overhead and minimal
environment, Firecracker is an excellent context to work on this.

This work is supported by Colin’s FreeBSD/EC2 Patreon.
