-   salvadore@ adopted all existing ports corresponding to supported
    versions of gcc, namely: lang/gcc10, lang/gcc11, lang/gcc11-devel,
    lang/gcc12, lang/gcc12-devel and lang/gcc13-devel. At the moment
    -devel ports are updated weekly, unless a build failure makes it
    impossible. Of course, in the latter case, the build failure is
    fixed and/or reported upstream as soon as possible.

-   GCC 12.2 has been released. Traditionally, FreeBSD waits for the
    release of the second minor version of GCC to use it as default GCC
    version, so that most of the software needing to be compiled with
    GCC has already been ported to the latest major version. Thus, work
    has started to update the default GCC version to version 12. Thank
    you very much to antoine@ who has already run the first exp-run and
    to all the contributors, maintainers and committers involved in the
    process. https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2659548

-   Discussion about LTO keeps going with many different points of view.
    If interested, you can read the latest contributions to the topic:
    lang/gcc11: Needs build time warning for /tmp consumption and
    lang/gcc11: build gets stuck. Reminder: LTO_BOOTSTRAP is an option
    enabled by default. If you build the port on your machine and its
    resources consumption is not acceptable, disabling this option will
    get you a lighter compilation.

-   jbeich@ submitted a patch to expose non-default -stdlib=libc++
    support, which has been successfully committed to all relevant ports
    (gcc >= 11). link:
    https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=265962

-   diizzy@ refreshed the mirrors list in the MASTER_SITE_GCC variables,
    also removing ftp mirrors. The main GCC site is used as fallback.

-   Help is still needed with these three changes to work through with
    upstream GCC (requires expertise with the GCC sources and upstream,
    not with the ports framework):

    -   upstreaming lang/gcc11/patch-gets-no-more

    -   upstreaming lang/gcc11/patch-arm-unwind-cxx-support
