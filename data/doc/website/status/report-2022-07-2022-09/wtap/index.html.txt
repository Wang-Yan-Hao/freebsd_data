wtap(4) is a net80211(4) Wi-Fi simulator introduced by Monthadar Al
Jaberi <monthadar@gmail.com> and Adrian Chadd <adrian@FreeBSD.org> in
2012. It originally supported 802.11s mesh mode and was used for
verification. During the 2022 Google Summer of Code, En-Wei had been
working on bringing sta, hostap, adhoc and monitor modes to it. The work
also covers adding basic tests for net80211(4) with wtap(4), written in
atf(7).

For more details, please check the project wiki page.
