Calendar-data: License added

The port deskutils/calendar-data contains calendar files for the BSD
calendar program and is maintained by se@. The data for this port lives
in a GitHub repository, which at the moment is maintained mainly by
salvadore@.

About two years ago, the calendar files in the base repository were
removed from there and a new repository was created on GitHub; see also
this Phabricator review about the creation of the associated port. This
improvement allows calendar files to be updated independently from the
base system.

Unfortunately, when the repository was created, it was forgotten to add
a license to it. The issue has been solved this quarter with this pull
request submitted by salvadore@ and merged by imp@. Since the data
originally came from the src repository, the same licence applies. If in
the past you have contributed to the calendar files with different
licensing assumptions, please inform us so that we can license your
contributions accordingly or remove them.
