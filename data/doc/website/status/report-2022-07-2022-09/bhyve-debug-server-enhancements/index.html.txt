bhyve debug server enhancements

Contact: Bojan Novković <bojan.novkovic@kset.org>

The goal of this project was to enhance the functionality of bhyve’s
debug server. Several existing features related to single-stepping are
tied to Intel-specific VM mechanisms, which severely impairs bhyve’s
debugging functionality on other x86 platforms. The first goal dealt
with extending single-stepping support to AMD hosts. The second goal was
to add support for hardware watchpoints using the guest OS’s hardware
debugging registers.

The project was carried out under Google’s Summer of Code program and
was finished around the end of July. The project’s wiki also contains
detailed documentation regarding several implemented mechanisms.

The changes can be summarized as follows:

-   Support for placing software breakpoints inside virtual machines on
    AMD platforms,

-   Support for single-stepping virtual machines on AMD platforms,

-   Support for placing hardware watchpoints inside virtual machines on
    Intel and AMD platforms.

Any feedback, comments and discussions are welcome and would be greatly
appreciated.
