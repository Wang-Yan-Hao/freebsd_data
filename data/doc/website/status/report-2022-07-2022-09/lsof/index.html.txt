sysutils/lsof major upgrade

Link:
lsof project repo URL: https://github.com/lsof-org/lsof

Contact:
Larry Rosenman <ler@FreeBSD.org>

sysutils/lsof had a major upgrade to no longer look in /dev/kmem for
data, and to use the userland API. This took a long time to hit the
tree, but is finally done. It fixes lsof(8) to work with ZFS again for
the first time since 13.0-RELEASE.

This will make maintenance much easier going forward.

To the kernel folks: if you make changes that break lsof, please submit
a GitHub pull request to https://github.com/lsof-org/lsof. Please test
any changes to the interfaces that lsof uses and make sure they still
work. These all should be userland interfaces now, but please test.

My thanks to Warner Losh <imp@FreeBSD.org>, Mateusz Guzik
<mjg@FreeBSD.org>, and Ed Maste <emaste@FreeBSD.org> for help getting
this major change landed.
