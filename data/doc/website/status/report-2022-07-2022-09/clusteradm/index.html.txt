Contact: Cluster Administration Team <clusteradm@FreeBSD.org>

FreeBSD Cluster Administration Team members are responsible for managing
the machines the Project relies on to synchronise its distributed work
and communications. In this quarter, the team has worked on the
following:

-   Added additional storage to the CI system. It will help store more
    artifacts.

-   VuXML deployed in all official mirrors. It speeds up the pkg audit
    functionality.

-   A new (and additional) monitoring system is in place.

-   A few old and faulty machines were decommissioned.

-   Moved several services to newer hardware.

-   Regular cluster-wide software upgrades

-   Regular support for FreeBSD.org user accounts

-   Regular disk and parts support (and replacement) for all physical
    hosts and mirrors.

Work in progress:

-   git infra: Add --filter support.

-   Work with the PowerPC team to improve the package builders,
    universal, and reference machines.

-   Site audit at our primary site: inventory of spares and other
    miscellanea occupying space in our cabinets.

-   Discussions with Juniper about a donation of new switches for our
    primary site.

-   Plan for a large scale network upgrade at our primary site.

-   Cluster refresh (more extended project). Most cluster machines are
    running FreeBSD 13-STABLE or 14-CURRENT as of 2022-09-30. Only a
    handful of machines are still on FreeBSD 12-STABLE.

We are looking for an additional full mirror site (five servers) in
Europe. See generic mirrored layout for our needs. Offers of additional
single-server mirrors are always welcome too, especially in Europe.
