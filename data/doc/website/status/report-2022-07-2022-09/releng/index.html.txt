The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is responsible for setting and
publishing release schedules for official project releases of FreeBSD,
announcing code freezes and maintaining the respective branches, among
other things.

During the third quarter of 2022, the Release Engineering Team continued
providing weekly development snapshot builds for the main, stable/13,
and stable/12 branches.

Additionally, the schedules for the upcoming 12.4, 13.2, and 14.0
release cycles were published on the Project website.
