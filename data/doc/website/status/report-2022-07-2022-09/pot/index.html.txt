Containers and FreeBSD: Pot, Potluck and Potman

Pot organization on github URL: https://github.com/bsdpot

Pot is a jail management tool that also supports orchestration through
Nomad.

During the last quarter, pot 0.15.3 was released. It contains a number
of improvements like mount-out to remove or unmount a previously
mount-in folder or filesystem, signal and exec commands, better jail
lifecycle handling, and many bug fixes.

A new version of the Nomad driver, nomad-pot-driver 0.9.0, was also
released with signal and exec support and stability fixes.

Potluck aims to be to FreeBSD and pot what Dockerhub is to Linux and
Docker: a repository of pot flavours and complete container images for
usage with pot and in many cases Nomad.

Since the last status report, many changes were committed, including
many fixes and improvements to core images like grafana,
postgresql-patroni or loki. Additionally, all images have been rebuilt
for FreeBSD 13.1 and 12.3 and to include the current quarterly versions
of the packages being used.

Last not least, Luca held the pot implementation and ecosystem talk How
far a naive FreeBSD container implementation can go at EuroBSDCon 2022.

As always, feedback and patches are welcome.
