Rewrite of pjdfstest

Contact: Alan Somers <asomers@FreeBSD.org>

Back in 2007, Pawel Jakub Dawidek <pjd@FreeBSD.org> wrote pjdfstest, a
POSIX file system conformance test tool. He originally wrote it to
validate the port of ZFS to FreeBSD, but it has subsequently been used
for other file systems and other operating systems.

This year, Sayafdine Said <musikid@outlook.com> rewrote it under
Google’s sponsorship. The new version has several improvements:

-   More configurable, for better use with other file systems.

-   Much faster, largely thanks to said configurability.

-   Better test case isolation, making failure easy to debug.

-   No longer requires root privileges for all test cases.

-   Test cases can be run in a debugger.

-   More maintainable, less duplication.

There are still a couple of lingering PRs to complete, but we expect to
wrap those up and add pjdfstest to the ports collection soon. From
there, it will be used both by /usr/tests for ZFS and UFS, and by
external developers for other file systems.
