OpenStack on FreeBSD

OpenStack is an open-source cloud operating system for different types
of resources like virtual and bare-metal machines. Users can spawn
FreeBSD instances on the open cloud platform, but it is not currently
possible to run OpenStack control plane on FreeBSD hosts. The goal of
this project is to port key OpenStack components so that FreeBSD can
function as an OpenStack host.

Academic and industrial research groups have been evaluating
CHERI-enabled Morello boards since mid-2022. A resource orchestration
platform like OpenStack can improve the speed and cost of provisioning,
managing, and recycling those boards.

Starting in January 2022, Chih-Hsin Chang has been working to port
several OpenStack components to run on FreeBSD, including:

-   Keystone (identity service)

-   Glance (image service)

-   Placement (resource tracking and inventory service)

-   Neutron (networking service)

-   Nova (compute service)

Some of the items are still under heavy development. For instance, due
to the design of Neutron, the DHCP servers are placed inside Linux
network namespaces. It is necessary to find an alternative, e.g. vnet,
on FreeBSD and adapt it. Most of the time the porting strategy is to
make as small of an impact as possible by working around obstacles. But
something like oslo.privsep deserves a true porting. oslo.privsep is
rooted in Linux capabilities to do the privilege separation work. Right
now we just bypassed any Linux capabilities-related operation inside
oslo.privsep. So there is plenty of hackish spots in the source code and
configurations currently. All of these along with the building and
installation steps will be collected in the project repositories.

In Q4 Chih-Hsin plans to focus on porting Neutron and Nova in order to
complete the VM lifecycle operations. The highlights include:

-   DHCP integration

-   FreeBSD bridge driver/agent

-   Bhyve + Libvirt integration
