Wine on FreeBSD

Links Wine home page

Contact: Gerald Pfeifer <gerald@FreeBSD.org> Contact: Damjan Jovanovic
<damjan.jov@gmail.com>

Wine allows running Windows programs on FreeBSD.

This quarter we focused on the wine-devel port that tracks mainline
development, followed half a dozen of version updates, simplified the
port, removed three options (SDL, VKD3D, VULKAN) which are
unconditionally active now, and fixed a number of portability issues.

These changes will make their way into the primary Wine port over the
coming weeks.

After working on our Wine ports for more than 21 years, maintaining for
more than 19 years, time has come to hand over the baton.

Luckily Damjan has stepped up and is going to look after wine-devel and
associated ports - thanks! Help with the following is still very
welcome:

-   WineHQ bug 50257

-   FreeBSD Bugzilla 257533

-   Maintain daily (or at least regular) test builds of upstream Wine.
    This quarter this triggered two dozen fixes in support of FreeBSD
    upstream, though usually it’s quite less effort.
