The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is responsible for setting and
publishing release schedules for official project releases of FreeBSD,
announcing code freezes and maintaining the respective branches, among
other things.

Throughout the third quarter, several development snapshots builds were
released for the main, stable/13, and stable/12 branches. More work had
been done on various release-related tooling following the conversion
from Subversion to Git. Additionally, the team had drafted the proposed
schedule for the upcoming 12.3-RELEASE.
