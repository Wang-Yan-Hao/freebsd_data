RFC1191 support in IPSEC tunnels

Contact: Wojciech Macek <wma@semihalf.com>

The Semihalf team has been working on providing support for RFC1191 in
IPSEC tunnels. This allows the PMTUD algorithm to dynamically discover
the maximum path MTU the tunnel can handle and update tunnel parameters
accordingly. As a result, a better performance can be observed as there
is no need for packet fragmentation.

The newly introduced rework includes:

-   NEEDFRAG support for IPSEC commit d9d59bb1af1

-   PMTUD for IPv4 IPSEC over IPv6 link commit 4f3376951d70

-   Security fix as per RFC1191 specs commit b4220bf387e6

-   PMTUD support for IPv6 tunnel commit 9dfc8606eb80
