Pot is a jail management tool that also supports orchestration through
Nomad.

In the last quarter, a new release 0.13.0 with a number of major new
features was made available.
Layered images allow a split into a foundation image component that only
changes seldom and that e.g. contains the basic jail and packages and a
"leaf" image component on top with potentially small additions that
might change more frequently, like software built in a CI pipeline.
Since it is not the complete image that has to be rebuilt each time,
image creation and distribution can be sped up immensely.
Also a copy-out command has been included where the container state that
was initialised from within the container can be made persistent and
reinjected into additional containers afterwards.

Potluck aims to be to FreeBSD and Pot what Dockerhub is to Linux and
Docker: a repository of Pot flavours and complete container images for
usage with Pot and in many cases Nomad.

Here we had a busy quarter. Not only did we commit a number of new
images like Nextcloud which can be deployed via Nomad, but the images
used to build the foundation of a virtual data center (Nomad, Consul and
Vault) themselves have received major updates.

For these images, further improvements for even better security and
reliability will likely be finished in the coming quarter.

Also, we are aware that right now the advantages of the container
approach as it is described in Virtual DC Part I/Part II/Part III are
not yet obvious and transparent enough and also no longer completely up
to date, so we plan to provide additional documentation as soon as we
find the time to do so.

Potman aims to simplify building Pot images with Vagrant and VirtualBox
based on the Potluck approach, e.g. as part of a DevOps workflow for
software development including testing and publishing them to a
repository.

Here, not too much has happened over the last quarter but the current
idea is to incorporate additional features in the medium to longer term
to modularise and simplify the image build definitions and then utilise
Potman in the Potluck library build process.

As always, feedback and patches are welcome.
