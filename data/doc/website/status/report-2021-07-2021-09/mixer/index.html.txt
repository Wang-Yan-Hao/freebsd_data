Sound mixer improvements

Contact: Christos Margiolis <christos@FreeBSD.org>

This project is an attempt to improve the capabilities of the OSS sound
mixer on FreeBSD. This means a new mixer(3) library, a complete rewrite
of mixer(8), and updates to sound(4).

Development started during Google Summer of Code 2021, but will likely
continue independently.

Applied changes:

-   Implement OSS mixer (un)muting ioctls in sound(4) (commit
    0f8dafb45859).

-   Implement playback/recording mode sysctl (commit ed2196e5df0c).

-   Implement mixer(3) and new version of mixer(8) (commit
    903873ce1560).

Patches, comments and discussion are all welcome.
