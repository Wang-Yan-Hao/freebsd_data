The 13.0-RELEASE image on Azure Marketplace has been published.

The changes for building official images on Azure Marketplace, which
fulfill the requirements of Azure and FreeBSD cloud images like disk
layout and UEFI for Gen2 VM, along with some minor improvements like
configurations to speed up booting, have been imported.

Above tasks are sponsored by The FreeBSD Foundation, with resources
provided by Microsoft.

Microsoft Azure Network Adapter (MANA) is the new network adapter from
Microsoft which will be available in the Azure public cloud. It provides
SR-IOV NIC as a Virtual Function (VF) to guest OS running on Hyper-V.
Wei has been working on its driver for a while and committed in this
quarter.

This task is sponsored by Microsoft.

Work in progress tasks:

-   Build and publish gen2 vm image to Azure Marketplace

-   Build and publish ZFS-based image to Azure Marketplace

-   Upstream local modifications of Azure agent

-   Update Azure agent port to the latest version

Open tasks:

-   Update FreeBSD related doc at https://docs.microsoft.com

-   Support FreeBSD in Azure Pipelines
