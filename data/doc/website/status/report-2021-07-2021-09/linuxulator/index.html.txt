Linux compatibility layer update

Contact: Dmitry Chagin, <dchagin@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Edward Tomasz Napierala, <trasz@FreeBSD.org>

The goal of this project is to improve FreeBSD’s ability to execute
unmodified Linux binaries. The current support status of specific Linux
applications is being tracked on the Linux app status Wiki page.

The vdso(7) implementation was reworked. The futex(2) support was
overhauled to make use of FreeBSD’s native umtx mechanism. It now
supports priority-inheritance futexes, in addition to fixing several
bugs.

The rt_sigsuspend(2) and sigaltstack(2) syscalls are now supported on
ARM64.

The faccessat2(2), clone3(2) system calls are now implemented. The
CLONE_CLEAR_RESETHAND option is now supported.

The prctl(2) syscall now supports PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS.

The ptrace(2) syscall now supports PTRACE_GET_SYSCALL_INFO, which is a
prerequisite to support newer strace(1) versions.

There is ongoing work to make Linuxulator on arm64 on par with the amd64
one; right now it’s good enough for development work.

Sponsor: EPSRC (Edward’s work)
