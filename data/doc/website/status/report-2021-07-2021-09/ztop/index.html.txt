Ztop

Contact: Alan Somers <asomers@FreeBSD.org>

ztop is a new utility that displays ZFS datasets' I/O in real time, like
top, but for ZFS. Unlike the existing zpool iostat, which only displays
traffic at the level of a pool, ztop displays it at the level of
individual datasets.

Previously, there was no tool that could display this information. The
Prometheus Node Exporter can export it into Prometheus, from which it
can be viewed after the fact with various other tools, but that requires
a large stack of software, and isn’t real-time.

I started ztop this quarter, and it is now fully functional. However, it
has revealed a performance problem within the kernel. In the presence of
more than a few thousand datasets, the sysctl interface is too slow and
ztop becomes sluggish. Future work, if I have the time, will address
that problem.
