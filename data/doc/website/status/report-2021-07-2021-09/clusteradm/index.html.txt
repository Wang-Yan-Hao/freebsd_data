Contact: Cluster Administration Team <clusteradm@FreeBSD.org>

FreeBSD Cluster Administration Team members are responsible for managing
the machines the Project relies on to synchronise its distributed work
and communications. In this quarter, the team has worked on the
following:

-   Fixed www.FreeBSD.org mirror sync source

-   Improvements to GeoDNS for {download,ftp,pkg}.FreeBSD.org

-   Added IPv6 support

-   More optimal mirror selection in Asia

-   Finished installing a new mirror site in Japan, sponsored by
    Broadband Tower, Inc.

-   Full mirror site (ftp, pkg, git, doc, dns,…​)

-   The network and machine resources for this mirror are generously
    sponsored by the Cloud and SDN Laboratory at BroadBand Tower, Inc.,
    one of the Internet data center service providers in Tokyo, Japan,
    with 300+ Gbps international IP transit bandwidth

-   Improved the retention script used for the artifact server of CI
    cluster to offer a mix of the latest artifacts but also a selection
    of older artifacts for comparison, space permitting

-   Ongoing day to day cluster administration

-   Replacing failed disks

-   Babysitting pkgsync

Work in progress:

-   Move pkg-master.nyi to new hardware

-   Improve the package building infrastructure

-   Review the service jails and service administrators operation

-   Setup powerpc pkgbuilder/ref/universal machines

-   Search for more providers that can fit the requirements for a
    generic mirrored layout or a tiny mirror

-   Upgrading public-facing cluster services from 12.2-STABLE to
    13.0-STABLE

-   Working with doceng@ to improve https://www.freebsd.org and
    https://docs.freebsd.org

-   Improve the web service architecture

-   Improve the cluster backup plan
