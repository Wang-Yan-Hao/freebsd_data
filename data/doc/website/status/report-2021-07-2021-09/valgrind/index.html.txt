Valgrind is an instrumentation framework for building dynamic analysis
tools. There are Valgrind tools that can automatically detect many
memory management and threading bugs, and profile your programs in
detail. You can also use Valgrind to build new tools.

With the release of version 3.18.0 of Valgrind, official FreeBSD support
has landed upstream. The two supported architectures are amd64 and i386
(x86).

The next step will be to update the FreeBSD port. This will involve
switching from code that was maintained out-of-tree for over 15 years to
using the official upstream tarball.

As Valgrind is closely tied to operating system details, obtaining
official FreeBSD support was the result of significant effort from
dozens of developers.
