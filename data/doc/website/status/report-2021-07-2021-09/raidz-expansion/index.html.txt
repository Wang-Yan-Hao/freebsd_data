Project

This feature allows disks to be added one at a time to a RAID-Z group,
expanding its capacity incrementally. This feature is especially useful
for small pools (typically with only one RAID-Z group), where there
isn’t sufficient hardware to add capacity by adding a whole new RAID-Z
group (typically doubling the number of disks).

FreeBSD’s ZFS implementation comes from the OpenZFS project. This work
will be integrated into the OpenZFS repo, with support for FreeBSD and
Linux.

Status

The work is functionally complete, and a pull request has been opened.

Remaining Work

Remaining work includes some code cleanup, design documentation,
addressing test failures.

We also need to solicit code reviewers and respond to code review
feedback.
