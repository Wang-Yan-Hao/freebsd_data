Boot Performance Improvements

Contact: Colin Percival <cperciva@FreeBSD.org>

Colin Percival is coordinating an effort to speed up the FreeBSD boot
process. For benchmarking purposes, he is using an EC2 c5.xlarge
instance as a reference platform and is measuring the time between when
the virtual machine enters the EC2 "running" state and when it is
possible to SSH into the instance.

This work started in 2017, leading to a conference presentation,
"Profiling the FreeBSD kernel boot", and quickly yielded roughly 4850 ms
of improvements (starting from a baseline of about 30 seconds).

Since June, another roughly 9790 ms of time has been shaved off the boot
process, taking it down to approximately 15 seconds. There is still more
work to be done; in particular, while the loader and kernel have been
profiled, the TSLOG system Colin is using does not currently support
userland profiling.

Issues are listed on the wiki page as they are identified; the wiki page
also has instructions for performing profiling. Users are encouraged to
profile the boot process on their own systems, in case they experience
delays which don’t show up on the system Colin is using for testing.

This work is supported by Colin’s FreeBSD/EC2 Patreon.
