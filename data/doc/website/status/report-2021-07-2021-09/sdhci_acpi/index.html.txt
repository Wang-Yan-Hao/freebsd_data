Marvell SDHCI improvements and ACPI support

Contact: Bartlomiej Grzesik <bag@semihalf.com>
Contact: Marcin Wojtas <mw@semihalf.com>

The Semihalf team was working on the ACPI support for the Marvell Octeon
TX2 CN913x and Armada 7k/8k SoCs' SD/MMC controller, as well as
extending and improving the related generic parts of the FreeBSD OS.

Applied changes:

-   Add ACPI_GET_PROPERTY to access Device Specific Data (DSD) commit
    b91fc6c43a81

-   Introduce generic device_get_property/device_has_property, which
    allow to obtain DT/ACPI properties with the same generic code commit
    3f9a00e3b577

-   Switch mmc_helper to device_* API, to access the controller
    description from DT/ACPI in a unified way commit 8a8166e5bcfb

-   Add ACPI support for the sdhci_xenon driver commit d78e464d2330 and
    commit adbce5ff747b

-   Apply other minor improvements and fixes related to properties
    parsing in core mmc code and sdhci_xenon driver.
