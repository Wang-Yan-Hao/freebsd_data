With the end of the third quarter of 2021, we are approaching the
one-year anniversary of the transition of the doc and src repositories
from Subversion to Git. The 2021Q4 branch of the ports tree has been
created, the third quarterly branch created using Git.

During 2021Q3, repository hooks have been refined as problems were
discovered and a few lingering references to Subversion were updated in
the Committer’s Guide. The Working Group continues to track progress on
two permissively-licensed Git-compatible tools: Gitup and Game of Trees.
Gitup is a small, dependency-free tool to clone and update git
repositories. It is used only to keep a local tree up-to-date, and has
no support for local commits. Game of Trees is a version control client
that is compatible with Git repositories. It provides a user interface
and workflow that is distinct from that of Git. It is in no way intended
to be a drop-in replacement for Git, but can be used to develop software
maintained in a Git repository.

Gitup and Game of Trees are currently available as ports and packages.
Future work will evaluate them as candidates for the base system.

Remaining work includes continuing with refinements to Git documentation
in the Handbook, committing new and updated repository hooks for
managing branch content and commit mail, and surveying pre-commit hooks
to use the CI cluster to build release artifacts. Priorities have been
set for the next working group tasked with refining our Git workflow.
The first meeting will be in mid-October.
