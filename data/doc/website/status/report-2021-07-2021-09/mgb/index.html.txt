Microchip’s LAN7430 and LAN7431 are PCIe Gigabit Ethernet interface ICs,
with an integrated PHY (LAN7430) or RGMII interface (LAN7431).

In 2019 Gerald ND Aryeetey, a FreeBSD Foundation intern, developed the
mgb(4) driver for these devices. It was added to the tree but not yet
connected to the build. Since it was committed a number of sweeping
iflib changes were made, which included updates to mgb(4).

I have addressed some outstanding issues in the driver, and have now
added the module to the build. It is available in -CURRENT snapshot
images. The driver is functional, although some additional work is still
needed. In particular, configuration of the Receive Filtering Engine,
and VLAN and RX/TX checksum offload are required. Caveats and notes are
described in the man page.

I am very interested in feedback and test results.
