The FreeBSD CI team maintains the continuous integration system of the
FreeBSD project. The CI system checks the committed changes can be
successfully built, then performs various tests and analysis over the
newly built results. The artifacts from those builds are archived in the
artifact server for further testing and debugging needs. The CI team
members examine the failing builds and unstable tests and work with the
experts in that area to fix the code or adjust test infrastructure.

During the third quarter of 2021, we continued working with the
contributors and developers in the project to fulfil their testing needs
and also keep collaborating with external projects and companies to
improve their products and FreeBSD.

Important changes:

-   The results of FreeBSD-main-amd64-build and FreeBSD-main-amd64-test
    jobs are sent to the dev-ci mailing list

New jobs:

-   Run tests with KASAN enabled for main on amd64

-   Run tests with KMSAN enabled for main on amd64

Retired jobs:

-   The jobs for stable/11 branch were removed after September 30th per
    FreeBSD 11.4 end-of-life

Work in progress and open tasks:

-   Designing and implementing pre-commit CI building and testing (to
    support the workflow working group)

-   Designing and implementing use of CI cluster to build release
    artifacts as release engineering does

-   Collecting and sorting CI tasks and ideas here

-   Testing and merging pull requests in the FreeBSD-ci repo

-   Reducing the procedures of CI/test environment setting up for
    contributors and developers

-   Setting up the CI stage environment and putting the experimental
    jobs on it

-   Setting up public network access for the VM guest running tests

-   Implementing using bare metal hardware to run test suites

-   Adding drm ports building tests against -CURRENT

-   Planning to run ztest tests

-   Adding more external toolchain related jobs

-   Improving maturity of the hardware lab and adding more hardware
    under test

-   Helping more software get FreeBSD support in its CI pipeline (Wiki
    pages: 3rdPartySoftwareCI, HostedCI)

-   Working with hosted CI providers to have better FreeBSD support

Please see freebsd-testing@ related tickets for more WIP information,
and don’t hesitate to join the effort!
