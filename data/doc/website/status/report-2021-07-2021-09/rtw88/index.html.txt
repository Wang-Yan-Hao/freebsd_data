Realtek rtw88 support

Links:
Rtw88 status FreeBSD wiki page URL: https://wiki.freebsd.org/WiFi/Rtw88

Contact: Bjoern A. Zeeb <bz@FreeBSD.ORG>

This project aims to bring in support for Realtek’s rtw88 chips.

With the growing LinuxKPI compatibility code an initial port of the
Realtek rtw88 driver was done. This gives us support for a second driver
after Intel and helps to validate and grow the LinuxKPI code base.
Changes and overall time needed to get the driver compiling were very
little. At the moment we are seeing DMA issues which prevent most people
from loading firmware or using the driver later on.

Thanks to everyone who was brave enough to give this initial code drop a
try.

While this is a leasure time project we would love to better support
Realtek wireless devices and will keep working on this.

For the latest state of the development or code, please follow the
referenced wiki page or the freebsd-wireless mailing list.
