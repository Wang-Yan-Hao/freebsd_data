Base System OpenSSH Update

OpenSSH, a suite of remote login and file transfer tools, was updated
from version 7.9p1 to 8.7p1 in the FreeBSD base system.

FreeBSD base OpenSSH includes a number of local bug fixes, configuration
changes, and small features. As part of the work for this update, I
submitted some of these upstream and am preparing to do the same with
the remaining changes.

OpenSSH now supports FIDO/U2F devices, although additional work is
required to enable this in the FreeBSD base system. This includes
importing a pair of dependencies: libcbor, and libfido2. Within the next
couple of months I expect to import these, enable FIDO/U2F support, and
update to OpenSSH version 8.8p1.

NOTE: OpenSSH 8.8p1 will disable the ssh-rsa signature scheme by
default, so some additional work is required for this next update. For
more information please see the Important note for future FreeBSD base
system OpenSSH update mailing list post.
