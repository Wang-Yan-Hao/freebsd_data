Introduction:

The FreeBSD status reports are back again with the 2003 year-end
edition. Many new projects are starting up and gaining momentum,
including XFS, MIPS, PowerPC, and networking locking and multithreading.
The end of 2003 also saw the release of FreeBSD 4.9, the first stable
release to have greater than 4GB support for the ia32 platform. Work on
FreeBSD 5.2 also finished up and was released early in January of 2004.
Many thanks to all of the people who worked so hard on these releases
and made them happen.

This is the largest status report ever, so read and enjoy!

Scott Long, Robert Watson

Bluetooth stack for FreeBSD (Netgraph implementation)

Contact: Maksim Yevmenkin <m_evmenkin@yahoo.com>

Not much to report. Bluetooth code was integrated into the FreeBSD
source tree. Bluetooth kernel modules appear to be stable. I have
received few success stories from the users.

During last few months the efforts were to make Bluetooth code more user
friendly. Bluetooth Service Discovery Procotol daemon sdpd was
reimplemented under BSD-style license and committed. The next step is to
integrate existing Bluetooth utilities with SDP.

Thanks to Matt Peterson <matt at peterson dot org> I now have Bluetooth
keyboard and mouse for development. I'm currently working on Bluetooth
HID profile implementation.

Dave Sainty <dave at dtsp dot co dot nz> from NetBSD project offered his
help in porting Bluetooth stack to NetBSD.

ACPI

The updated acpi_cpu driver was committed in November. Work is ongoing
to finish support for _CST re-evaluation, which makes it possible for
laptops based on processors like the Centrino to use varying CPU idle
states when on or off AC power. 5.2-RELEASE also went out with support
for _CID packages, which fixed mouse probing for Compaq users. Control
of CPU idle states and throttling can now be done through rc.conf(5)
settings for the /etc/power_profile script, which switches between
performance/economy levels when the AC status changes.

One huge task underway is the cpufreq project, a framework for detecting
and controlling various frequency/voltage technologies (SpeedStep,
LongRun, ACPI Performance states, etc.) The ACPI performance states
driver is working and the framework is being implemented. It requires
newbus attachments for CPUs so some ground work needs to go in before
the driver can be committed.

ACPI-CA was updated to 20031203 in early December and with a few patches
is reasonably stable. An ACPI debugging how-to has been written and is
being DocBooked by trhodes@. Ongoing work on fixing interrupt storms due
to various ways of setting up the SCI is being done by jhb@.

I'd like to welcome Philip Paeps (philip@) to the FreeBSD team. Philip
has written an ACPI ASUS driver that will be committed soon and has been
very helpful on the mailing lists. We've also had a lot of help from
jhb@, marcel@, imp@, and peter@. We're hoping to see the return of
takawata@ and iwasaki@, who have been very helpful in the past. If any
developers are interested in assisting with ACPI, please see the ACPI
TODO and send us an email.

AGP 3.0 Support

Contact: John Baldwin <jhb@FreeBSD.org>

Simple support AGP 3.0 including support for AGP 8x mode was added. The
support is simple in that it still assumes only one master and one
target. The main gain is the ability to use AGP 8x with drm modules that
support it.

Binary security updates for FreeBSD

  ------- -------------------------------------------------

          URL: http://www.daemonology.net/freebsd-update/
  ------- -------------------------------------------------

Contact: Colin Percival <cperciva@daemonology.net>

Thanks to recent donations, I am now building binary security updates
for FreeBSD {4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 5.0, 5.1, 5.2}-RELEASE. (Note that FreeBSD
4.7 and 5.0 are no longer officially supported; any advisories which are
not reflected in the CVS tree will likewise not result in binary
updates.)

The current version (1.5) of FreeBSD Update will warn about locally
modified files and will, by default, leave them untouched; if a
"distribution branch", (i.e. crypto, nocrypto, krb4, or krb5) is
specified, FreeBSD Update can be forced to "update" files which have
been compiled locally.

The only major issue remaining with FreeBSD Update is the
single-point-of-failure of the update building process; I would like to
resolve this in the future by having several machines cross-verify and
cross-sign, but this will require a significant investment of time, and
will probably have to wait until I've finished writing my DPhil thesis.

Compile FreeBSD with Intels C compiler (icc)

  Some patches   URL: http://www.Leidinger.net/FreeBSD/
  -------------- ----------------------------------------

Contact: Alexander Leidinger <netchild@FreeBSD.org>

The FreeBSD kernel now builds and runs fine with icc v7 (only GENERIC
and a custom kernel tested so far). A review on arch@ revealed no major
concerns and some src committers are willing to commit the patches. As
icc v8 is out and defines __GNUC__ I want to rework the patches before
they get committed so an icc v8 compiled kernel DTRT too.

A complete build of the ports collection (as of start of December)
finished and is under review to determine the reason of build failures.
Current icc stats:

-   1108 failed builds (excluding build failures because of failed
    dependencies)
-   3535 successfully build packages (~ 1.7 GB)

A parallel build with gcc on the same snapshot of the ports collection
has:

-   520 failed builds (excluding build failures because of failed
    dependencies)
-   7261 successfully build packages (~ 4.8 GB)

The above mentioned build of the ports collection was run on a P4 with a
icc compiled kernel (optimized for a P4). No kernel panics or other
strange behavior was noticed. The ports collection was build with a
CPUTYPE of p4 and CFLAGS set to "-Os -pipe -mfpmath=sse -msse2" in the
gcc and "-O2" in the icc case. No package is tested for correct run-time
behavior so far.

2003 was quite successful for the Donations team. We shepherded over 200
items from donors into the hands of developers. Some high points
include: a small cluster for the security team, assorted laptop hardware
for our cardbus work, and documentation for our standards group. In the
main FreeBSD.org cluster we were able to replace 8 DEC Miata machines
with 6 Alpha DS10s (21264). Every committer doing SMP work now has
multi-processor testing hardware.

We have smoothed out the tax deduction process with the FreeBSD
Foundation, and can ship donated items directly to the recipients
instead of tying up Foundation time handling shipping.

Current team membership is: Michael Lucas, David O'Brien, and Tom
Rhodes. Wilko Bulte has replaced Robert Watson as the Core Team
representative.

DVB-ASI Support

Contact: Vincent Jardin <Vincent.Jardin@6wind.com>

DVB ASI stands for Digital Video Broadcast - Asynchronous Serial
Interface. It is the standard defined to send and receive DVB stream
from Satellite (DVB-S), Terrestrial link (DVB-T), and TV Cable (DVB-C).
This standard was developed in Europe to transport 188-byte MPEG cells
and 204-byte MPEG cells. However it can be used to carry IP over DVB
too.

The FreeBSD driver uses the newbus amd the bus-dma API. It means that it
could be easily ported to all the BSD flavors (NetBSD, OpenBSD).

It uses the same API than the Linux DVB ASI support from ComputerModules
that is based on the following devices:

-   /dev/asitxN for the transmit stream (only open, write, select, close
    and ioctl are supported)
-   /dev/asirxN for the receive stream (only open, read, select, close
    and ioctl are supported)

It means that software such as Videolan that support DVB-ASI
broadcasting could be supported by this driver.

Special thanks to Tom Thorsteinson from Computer Modules who helped
6WIND to port their driver. It is used by 6WIND in order to provide
IPv4, IPv6, Ethernet and our network services over DVB.

  --------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------

Contact: Mark Linimon <linimon_at_lonesome_dot_com>

Enhancements continue to be made to the system. Several, including
improvements to the PR classification algorithm, the ability to more
correctly guess when a PR has been updated, and better handling of
errors in both port Makefiles and the bento builds, are invisible to
end-users. However, the addition of a "repocopy" classification is
notable, as is the allowing the wildcard search in "overview of one
port" (thanks to edwin@ for the shove in that direction.) Additionally,
logic has been added to identify the proposed category/portname of new
ports, with the goal being to quickly identify possible duplications of
effort. (Some SQL performance was sacrificed to this goal, leading to
some pages to load more slowly; this needs to be fixed.)

The other work has been on an email back-end to allow the occasional
sending of email to maintainers. Two functions are currently available:
"remind maintainers of their ports that are marked BROKEN", and "remind
maintainers of PRs that they may not have seen." A recent run of the
former got generally good response, especially as changing some cases of
BROKEN to IGNORE (PR ports/61090) had removed almost all the annoying
false positives. However, work remains to try to find out why a few
allegedly broken ports only fail in certain environments (including the
bento cluster).

The next plan is to use the proposed DEPRECATED Makevar (see
ports/59362) to create a new report to allow querying of "ports
currently slated to be removed". This report could also be posted to
ports@ periodically with minimal work. The author believes that doing
this would allow the port deprecation process to be much more visible to
the general FreeBSD user community.

TLB support code and PMAP have come along nicely. GCC and related have
been kept up to date with the main tree. An evaluation board from
Broadcom was donated and initial work on that platform has been
occurring. Much old and obsolete code brought from NetBSD for
bootstrapping the effort has been cleaned up. The system has been seen
to get to the point of trying to initialize filesystems, but there are
still bugs even before that milestone.

FreeBSD/powerpc on PPCBug-based embedded boards

Contact: Rafal Jaworowski <rafal.jaworowski@motorola.com>

The direct objective is to make FreeBSD/powerpc work on Motorola MCP750
and similar (single board computer that is compliant with Compact PCI
standard) Based on this work it would be easy to bring it to other
embedded systems.

1. loader(8): it is based on the existing loader for FreeBSD/powerpc
port but binding to OpenFirmware was removed and replaced with PPCBug
firmware binding. It only supports netbooting for the moment, so disk
(compact flash) support needs to be done one day. The loader is the only
piece that relies onPPCBug system calls - once the kernel starts it
doesn't need firmware support any longer.

2. kernel: it is now divorced from OpenFirmware dependencies; most of
the groundwork finished includes: nexus stuff is sorted out (resources
management is ok except interrupts assignment); host to PCI bridge low
level routines are finished so configuration of and access to PCI
devices works; the only important thing missing is the IRQ management
(Raven MPIC part is done, but the board has the second PIC,
8259-compatible that needs to be set up, but here the existing code from
x86 arch will be adopted).

Once the IRQ management is cleared out, most of the devices on board
would work straight away since they are pretty standard chips with
drivers already implemented in the tree (e.g. if_de).

At the moment work is on hold (don't have physical access to the device)
but will resume when I'm back home (late Feb).

FreeBSD has well over a few hundred tunables without documentation. This
project aims at designing an automated process to rip all available
tunables and generate a manual page based on the selected kernel
options. The ideal implementation, however; would gather tunables from
the LINT kernels as well. This would provide a default manual page for
all supported architectures. A simple tool has been forged from the
various off-list and on-list discussions and is waiting review from the
-doc team. Anyone interesting in reviewing my current work is requested
to get in contact with me.

with 8bit rendering and perfect integration of true graphic drivers in
the kernel.

Now it is time to bring it to end user and a precompiled R5.2 GENERIC
kernel is available for this (see the site news). In parallel, after
providing a last tarball/patch for R5.2, everything will move to
Perforce.

As always, volunteers are welcome. The task is huge but very exciting.

The libkse library will shortly be renamed to libpthread and be made the
default thread library. This includes making the GCC -pthread option
link to -lpthread instead of libc_r and changing PTHREAD_LIBS to
-lpthread. David Xu has been working on GDB support and has it working
with the GDB currently in our tree. The next step is to make a
libpthread_db and get it working with GDB 6.0 which marcel has imported

The libarchive library, which reads and writes tar and cpio archives, is
about ready to commit to the tree. The bsdtar program, built on
libarchive, is also nearing completion and should soon be a worthwhile
successor to our aging GNU tar. I plan a gradual transition during which
"bsdtar" and "gtar" will coexist in the tree.

Oddly enough, libarchive and bsdtar are the first fruits of a project to
completely rewrite the pkg tools. I've started architecting a libpkg
library for handling routine package management and have a prototype
pkg_add that is three times faster than the current version.

Network interface naming changes

Contact: Brooks Davis <brooks@FreeBSD.org>

At the end of October, the if_name and if_unit members of struct ifnet
were replaced with if_xname from NetBSD and if_dname and if_dunit. These
represent the name of the interface and the driver name and instance of
the interface respectively. Other then breaking IPFilter for a few weeks
due to the userland being on the vendor branch, this change went quite
well. A few ports needed minor changes, but otherwise nothing changed
from the user perspective.

The purpose of this change was the lay the groundwork for support for
network interface renaming and to allow the implementation of more
interesting pseudo interface cloning support. An example of interesting
cloning support would be using "ifconfig fxp0.20 create" to create and
configure a vlan interface on fxp0 that handled frames marked with the
tag 20. Interface renaming is being worked on in Perforce at the moment
with a working version expected for review soon. Support for enhanced
device cloning is still in the planing stage.

Network Subsystem Locking and Performance

Contact: Sam Leffler <sam@FreeBSD.org>

The purpose of this project is to improve performance of the network
subsystem. A major part of this work is to complete the locking of the
networking subsystem so that it no longer depends on the "Giant lock"
for proper operation. Removing the use of Giant will improve performance
and permit multiple instances of the network stack to operate
concurrently on multiprocessor systems.

Locking of the network subsystem is largely complete. Network drivers,
middleware layers (e.g. ipfw, dummynet, bridge, etc.), the routing
tables, IPv4, NFS, and sockets are locked and operating without the use
of Giant. Much of this work was included in the 5.2 release, but not
enabled by default. The remaining work (mostly locking of the socket
layer) will be committed to CVS as soon as we can resolve how to handle
"legacy protocols" (i.e. those protocols that are not locked). The code
can be obtained now from the Perforce database. A variety of test and
production systems have been running this code for several months
without any obvious issues.

Performance analysis and tuning is ongoing. Initial results indicate SMP
performance is already better than 4.x systems but UP performance is
still lagging (though improved over -current). The removal of Giant from
the network subsystem has reduced contention on Giant and highlighted
performance bottlenecks in other parts of the system.

This work was supported by the FreeBSD Foundation.

Much work has been invested into getting release 2.00 stable. It
provides the complete OpenBSD 3.4 function set, as well as fine grained
locking to work with a giant free network stack.

pf provides: IPv6 filtering and normalization, "syn-proxy" to protect
(web)server against SYN-floods, passive OS detection, fast and modular
address tables, source/policy routing, stateful filter and normalization
engine, structured rulesets via anchors and many many more. Especially
in connection with ALTQ, pf can help to harden against various flood
attacks and improve user experience.

New features from OpenBSD-Current like: state synchronization over wire
and enhanced support for cloned interfaces require patches to the
kernel. We are trying to resolve this issue and start OpenBSD-Current
tracking again as soon as possible.

SGI XFS port for FreeBSD

Contact: Alexander Kabaev <kan@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Russell Cattelan <cattelan@thebarn.com>

A project was started to revive a stalled effort to port SGI XFS
journaling filesystem to FreeBSD. The project is based on Linux
development sources from SGI and is currently being kept in a private
Perforce repository. The work is progressing slowly due to lack of free
time. At the moment we have XFS kernel module which is capable of
mounting XFS filesystems read-only, with a panic or two happening
infrequently, that need to be isolated and fixed. Semi-working metadata
updates with full transaction support are there too, but will probably
have to be rewritten to minimize the amount of custom kernel changes
required.

We seek volunteers to help with userland part of the port. Namely,
existing xfsprogs port needs to be cleaned up, incompletely ported
utilities brought into a working shape. xfs_dump/xfs_restore and as much
from xfstests suite as possible need to be ported too. We do not need
testers for now, so please to not ask for module sources just yet.

SMPng Status Report

  -------
  Links
  -------

Contact: John Baldwin <jhb@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: <smp@FreeBSD.org>

Work is progressing on SMPng on several different fronts. Sam Leffler
and several other folks have been working on locking the network stack
as mentioned elsewhere in this update. Several infrastructure
improvements have been made in the past few months as well.

The low-level interrupt code for the i386 architecture has been
redesigned to allow for a runtime selection between different types of
interrupt controllers. This work allows the Advanced Programmable
Interrupt Controllers (APICs) to be used instead of the AT 8259A PIC
without having to compile a separate kernel to do so. It also allows the
APIC to be used in a UP kernel as well as on a UP box. Together, all
these changes allow an SMP kernel to work on a UP box and thus allowed
SMP to be enabled in GENERIC as it already is on all of the other
supported architectures. This work also reworked the APIC support to
correctly route PCI interrupts when using an APIC to service device
interrupts. This work was also used to add SMP support to the amd64
port.

A turnstile implementation was committed that implemented a queue of
threads blocked on a resource along with priority inheritance of blocked
threads to the owner of the resource. Turnstiles were then used to
replace the thread queue built into each mutex object which shrunk the
size of each mutex as well as reduced the use of the sched_lock spin
mutex.

TrustedBSD "Security-Enhanced BSD" (SEBSD) is a port of NSA's SELinux
FLASK security architecture, Type Enforcement (TE) policy engine and
language, and sample policy to FreeBSD using the TrustedBSD MAC
Framework. SEBSD is available as a loadable policy module for the MAC
Framework, along with a set of userspace extensions support
security-extended labeling calls. In most cases, existing MAC Framework
functions provide the necessary abstractions for SEBSD to plug in
without SEBSD-specific changes, but some extensions to the MAC Framework
have been required; these changes are developed in the SEBSD development
branch, then merged to the MAC branch as they mature, and then to the
FreeBSD development tree.

Unlike other MAC Framework policy modules, the SEBSD module falls under
the GPL, as it is derived from NSA's implementation. However, the
eventual goal is to support plugging SEBSD into a base FreeBSD install
without any modifications to FreeBSD itself.

TrustedBSD SEBSD development branch in Perforce integrated to
5.2-RELEASE. Other changes in the MAC branch, including restructuring of
MAC Framework files also integrated, and a move to zone allocation for
labels. See the TrustedBSD MAC Framework report for more detail on these
and other MAC changes that also affect the SEBSD work.

FreeBSD PTY code modified so that the MAC Framework and SEBSD module can
create pty's with the label of the process trying to access them.
Improves compatibility with the SELinux sample policy. (Not yet merged)

SEBSD now loads its initial policy in the boot loader rather than using
a dummy policy until the root file system is mounted, and then loading
it using VFS operations. This avoids initial labeling and access control
conditions during the boot.

security_load_policy() now passes a memory buffer and length to the
kernel, permitting the policy reload mechanisms to be shared between the
early boot load and late reloads. The kernel SEBSD code now no longer
needs to perform direct file I/O relating to reading the policy.
checkpolicy now mmap's the policy before making the system call.

SEBSD now enforces protections on System V IPC objects and methods.
Shared memory, semaphores, and message queues are labeled, and most
operations are controlled. The sample policy has been updated.

The TrustedBSD MAC Framework now controls mount, umount, and remount
operations. A new MAC system call, mac_get_fs() can be used to query the
mountpoint label. lmount() system call allows a mount label to be
explicitly specified at mount time. The SEBSD policy module has been
updated to reflect this functionality, and sample TE policy has been
updated. (Not yet merged)

SEBSD now enforces protections on POSIX semaphores; the sample policy
has been updated to demonstrate how to label and control sempahores.
This includes sample rules for PostgreSQL.

The SEBSD sample policy, policy syntax, and policy tools have been
updated to the SELinux code drop from August. Bmake these pieces so we
don't need gmake.

Provide file ioctl() MAC Framework entry point and SEBSD implementation.

A large number of sample policy tweaks and fixes. The policy has been
updated to permit cron to operate properly. It has been updated for
FreeBSD 5.2 changes, including dynamically linked root. Teach the sample
policy about FreeBSD's sendmail wrapper.

Adapt sysinstall and install process for SEBSD pieces. Teach sysinstall,
newfs, et al, about multilabel file systems, install SEBSD sample policy
pieces, build policy. Automatically load the SEBSD module on first boot
after install.

Allow "ls -Z" to print out labels without long format.

TrustedBSD Access Control Lists (ACLs) provide extended discretionary
access control support for the UFS and UFS2 file systems on FreeBSD.
They implement POSIX.1e ACLs with some extensions, and meet the Common
Criteria CAPP requirements. Most ACL-related work is complete, with
remaining tasks associated with userspace integration, third party
applications, and compatibility

Prototyped Solaris/Linux semantics for combining ACLs and the umask: if
an default ACL mask is defined, substitute that mask for the umask,
permitting ACLs to override umasks. (Not merged)

The TrustedBSD Project is producing an implementation of CAPP compliant
Audit support for use with FreeBSD. Little progress was made on this
implementation between October and December other than an update to the
existing development tree. However, in January, work began on porting
the Darwin Audit implementation to FreeBSD. Details on this work will
appear in the next report; more information is available on the
TrustedBSD audit discussion list. Perforce messages may be seen on the
trustedbsd-cvs mailing list.

TrustedBSD Mandatory Access Control (MAC)

The TrustedBSD Mandatory Access Control (MAC) Framework permits the
FreeBSD kernel and userspace access control policies to be adapted at
compile-time, boot-time, or run-time. The MAC Framework provides common
infrastructure components, such as policy-agnostic labeling, making it
possible to easily development and distribute new access control policy
modules. Sample modules include Biba, MLS, and Type Enforcement, as well
as a variety of system hardening policies.

TrustedBSD MAC development branch in Perforce integrated to 5.2-RELEASE.

The TrustedBSD MAC Framework now enforces protections on System V IPC
objects and methods. Shared memory, semaphores, and message queues are
labeled, and most operations are controlled. The Biba, MLS, Test, and
Stub policies have been updated for System V IPC. (Not yet merged)

The TrustedBSD MAC Framework now enforces protections on POSIX semaphore
objects and methods. The Biba, MLS, Test, and Stub policies have been
updated. (Not yet merged)

The TrustedBSD MAC Framework's central kernel implementation previously
existed in one large file, src/sys/kern/kern_mac.c. It is now broken out
into a series of by-service files in src/sys/security/mac.
src/sys/security/mac/mac_internal.h specifies APIs, structures, and
variables used internally across the different parts of the framework.
System calls and registration still occur in kern_mac.c. This permits
more easy maintenance of locally added object types. (Merged)

Break out mac_policy_list into two different lists, one to hold "static"
policy modules -- ones loaded prior to kernel initialization, and that
may not be loaded, and one for "dynamic" policy modules -- that are
either loaded later in boot, or may be unloaded. Perform less
synchronization when using static modules only, reducing overhead for
entering the framework when not using dynamic modules. (Merged)

Introduced a kernel option, MAC_STATIC, which permits only statically
registered policy modules to be loaded at boot or compiled into the
kernel. When running with MAC_STATIC, no internal synchronization is
required in the MAC Framework, lowering the cost of MAC Framework entry
points. (Not yet merged)

Make mac.h userland API definition C++-happy. (Merged)

Created mac_support.4, a declaration of what kernel and userspace
features are (and aren't) supported with MAC. (Not yet merged)

Stale SEBSD module deleted from MAC branch; SEBSD module will solely be
developed in the SEBSD branch from now on. See the TrustedBSD SEBSD
report for more detail.

Use only pointers to 'struct label' in various kernel objects outside
the MAC Framework, and use a zone allocator to allocate label storage.
This permits label structures to have their size changed more easily
without changing the normal kernel ABI. This also lowers the non-MAC
memory overhead for base kernel structures. This also simplifies
handling and storage of labels in some of the edge cases where labels
are exposed outside of the Framework, such as in execve(). Include files
outside of the Framework are substantially simplified and now frequently
no longer require _label.h. (Merged)

Giant pushed down into the MAC Framework in a number of MAC related
system calls, as it is not required for almost all of the MAC Framework.
The exceptions are areas where the Framework interacts with pieces of
the kernel still covered by MAC and relies on Giant to protect label
storage in those structures. However, even in those cases, we can push
Giant in quite a bit past label internalization/externalization/ storage
allocation/deallocation. This substantially simplifies file
descriptor-based MAC label system calls. (Merged)

Remove unneeded mpo_destroy methods for Biba, LOMAC, and MLS since they
cannot be unloaded. (Merged)

Biba and MLS now use UMA zones for label allocation, which improves
storage efficiency and enhances performance. (Merged)

Bug fix for mac_prepare_type() to better support arbitrary object label
definitions in /etc/mac.conf. (Merged)

Labels added to 'struct inpcb', which represents TCP and UDP connections
at the network layer. These labels cache socket labels at the
application layer so that the labels may be accessed without application
layer socket locks. When a label is changed on the socket, it is pushed
down to the network layer through additional entry points. Biba, MLS
policies updated to reflect this change. (Merged)

SO_PEERLABEL socket option fixed so that peer socket labels may be
retrieved. (Merged)

mac_get_fd() learns to retrieve local socket labels, providing a simpler
API than SO_LABEL with getsockopt(). mac_set_fd() learns about local
socket labels, providing a simpler API than SO_LABEL with setsockopt().
This also improves the ABI by not embedding a struct label in the socket
option arguments, instead using the copyin/copyout routine for labels
used for other object types. (Merged)

Some function names simplified relating to socket options. (Merged)

Library call mac_get_peer() implemented in terms of getsockopt() with
SO_PEERLABEL to improve API/ABI for networked applications that speak
MAC. (Merged)

mac_create_cred() renamed to mac_cred_copy(), similar to other label
copying methods, allowing policies to implement all the label copying
method with a single function, if desired. This also provides a better
semantic match for the crdup() behavior. (Merged)

Support "id -M", similar to Trusted IRIX. (Not yet merged)

TCP now uses the inpcb label when responding in timed wait, avoiding
reaching up to the socket layer for label information in otherwise
network-centric code.

Numerous bug fixes, including assertion fixes in the MAC test policy
relating to execution and relabeling. (Merged)

Wireless Networking Support

Contact: Sam Leffler <sam@FreeBSD.org>

Work to merge the NetBSD and MADWIFI code bases is almost complete. This
brings in new features and improves sharing which will enable future
development. Support was added for 802.1x client authentication (using
the open1x xsupplicant program) and for shared key authentication (both
client and AP) which improves interopability with systems like OS X. The
awi driver was updated to use the common 802.11 layer and the Atheros
driver received extensive work to support hardware multi-rate retry.
Kismet now works with the device-independent radiotap capture format.
All of this work is still in Perforce but should be committed to CVS
soon.

Work has begun on full 802.1x and WPA support.
