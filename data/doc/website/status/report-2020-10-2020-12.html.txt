Introduction

This report covers FreeBSD related projects for the period between
October and December, and is the fourth of four planned reports for
2020.

This quarter had quite a lot of work done, including but certainly not
limited to, in areas relating to everything from multiple architectures
such as x86, aarch64, riscv, and ppc64 for both base and ports, over
kernel changes such as vectored aio, routing lookups and multipathing,
an alternative random(4) implementation, zstd integration for kernel
dumps, log compression, zfs and preparations for pkg(8), along with wifi
changes, changes to the toolchain like the new elfctl utility, and all
the way to big changes like the git migration and moving the
documentation from DocBook to Hugo/AsciiDoctor, as well as many other
things too numerous to mention in an introduction.

This report with 42 entries, which don't hold the answer to life, the
universe and everything, couldn't have happened without all the people
doing the work also writing an entry for the report, so the quarterly
team would like to thank them, as otherwise, we wouldn't have anything
to do.

Please note that the deadline for submissions covering the period
between January and March is March 31st.

We hope you'll enjoy reading as much as we enjoyed compiling it.
Daniel Ebdrup Jensen, on behalf of the quarterly team.

FreeBSD Team Reports

Entries from the various official and semi-official teams, as found in
the Administration Page.

FreeBSD Foundation

Contact: Deb Goodkin <deb@FreeBSDFoundation.org>

The FreeBSD Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated
to supporting and promoting the FreeBSD Project and community worldwide.
Funding comes from individual and corporate donations and is used to
fund and manage software development projects, conferences and developer
summits, and provide travel grants to FreeBSD contributors. The
Foundation purchases and supports hardware to improve and maintain
FreeBSD infrastructure and provides resources to improve security,
quality assurance, and release engineering efforts; publishes marketing
material to promote, educate, and advocate for the FreeBSD Project;
facilitates collaboration between commercial vendors and FreeBSD
developers; and finally, represents the FreeBSD Project in executing
contracts, license agreements, and other legal arrangements that require
a recognized legal entity.

Here are some highlights of what we did to help FreeBSD last quarter:

COVID-19 Impact to the Foundation

Like most organizations, we transitioned all of our staff to work from
home. We also put a temporary ban on travel for staff members, which
didn't affect our output too much, since most conferences went virtual.
We continued supporting the community and Project, even though some of
our work and responses may have been delayed because of changes in some
of our priorities and the impact of limited childcare for a few of our
staff members.

Partnerships and Commercial User Support

We help facilitate collaboration between commercial users and FreeBSD
developers. We also meet with companies to discuss their needs and bring
that information back to the Project. Not surprisingly, the stay at home
orders, combined with our company ban on travel during Q4 made in-person
meetings non-existent. However, the team was able to continue meeting
with our partners and commercial users virtually. These meetings help us
understand some of the applications where FreeBSD is used.

An event we help plan and organize, that helps with vendor/developer
engagement, is the annual Bay Area Vendor Summit. We weren't going to
let a pandemic stop us from holding this invaluable yearly event, so we
went virtual! From the feedback we received from the vendor community on
how we should run this, so it would be beneficial for them, we decided
to hold this over 3 half days in November. One unexpected result was
that more commercial users from around the world attended. Since a
Vendor/Developer Summit is typically invitation only, we opened this up
to FreeBSD contributors from around the world to watch the livestream.
Because of the success and excitement of this event, we are planning to
hold another one around June or July.

Fundraising Efforts

We want to take a moment to say thank you to all the individuals and
corporations that stepped up to help fund our efforts last year. As of
this writing, we raised $1,235,926, and will have the final tally by
mid-January. The companies that gave generous financial contributions
include Arm, NetApp, Netflix, Juniper Networks, Beckhoff, VMware,
Stormshield, Tarsnap, and Google. We also want to say thank you to the
Koum Family Foundation for awarding us a large grant, and to the
employees of Nginx who also made generous financial contributions.

We truly appreciate these large contributions, which makes the most
impact on how much we can contribute back to the Project. However, it's
the individual donations that have the most meaning to us. Those are the
folks who are giving because they trust we will invest their personal
donations, whether large or small, into improving the operating system
and Project. As stewards of your donations, we want to thank you for
your trust in us and your commitment to making FreeBSD the best platform
for products, education, research, computing, and more.

You'll find out how we used your donations for Q4 in our report, as well
as in individual reports throughout this status report.

Though we know this is a Q4 status report, we are excited about our
plans for 2021, including growing our software development team! We'll
be posting two job descriptions for a Senior Software Developer and
Project Coordinator soon.

Please consider making a donation to help us continue and increase our
support for FreeBSD in 2021: https://www.FreeBSDfoundation.org/donate/.

We also have the Partnership Program, to provide more benefits for our
larger commercial donors. Find out more information at
https://www.FreeBSDfoundation.org/FreeBSD-foundation-partnership-program/
and share with your companies!

OS Improvements

The Foundation provided many project grants over the last quarter, and
you can read about OpenZFS Zstd support, Linuxulator application
compatibility improvements, LLDB target support, test lab
infrastructure, and WiFi projects in other entries in this quarterly
report.

The Foundation hired six co-op students from the University of Waterloo
during the 2020 fall term, as well as one intern. Former co-op student
Tiger returned, and new students Yang and Zac joined us for the first
time.

Tiger worked on improvements to the code-coverage guided kernel fuzzing
tool Syzkaller, adding new system call definitions so that Syzkaller can
expand the code it tests. A number of FreeBSD kernel bug fixes have
already resulted from this work. Tiger also contributed a number of
improvements to the ELF Tool Chain set of binary utilities, and worked
on tooling to run tests from other tool suites against ELF Tool Chain.

Zac worked on an improvement to the pkg package management tool,
investigating and upstreaming patches for FreeBSD support in FreePBX,
and investigating compiler support for addressing the stack clash
vulnerability.

Yang investigated and fixed a compilation bug with the kernel's
Skein-1024 assembly implementation (used by ZFS), and then a number of
projects related to Capsicum: applying Capsicum to sort(1), implementing
a Capsicum service to execute utilities, and finally working with
developers of the Game of Trees (got) version control system to adapt it
for Capsicum support.

Our intern Ka Ho focused on improving the desktop experience of the
FreeBSD. He fixed and improved many items of OBS (Open Broadcaster
Software) on FreeBSD, worked on FreeBSD native audio support on Firefox,
adding a facility that user-space audio programs could make use of to
enumerate a list of audio devices. He also ported the fcitx5 input
method framework.

The five Foundation staff members continued contributions in 2020 in
both ongoing operational tasks (including the Git working group and
security team) and software development for a number of projects.

Staff members responded to reported security vulnerabilities and release
errata, prepared patches, and participated in the security advisory
process. We also worked on proactive security vulnerability mitigations.
Syzkaller also provided many reports of kernel issues that resulted in
Foundation-sponsored bug fixes. We worked on several issues relating to
FreeBSD/arm64 to move it along the path of being a Tier-1 architecture.

We participated in code reviews and supported community members in
integrating changes into FreeBSD, and triaged incoming bug reports.

We contributed enhancements to many kernel and userland subsystems,
including the x86 pmap layer, ELF run-time linker and kernel loader, the
Capsicum sandboxing framework and Casper services, the threading
library, some RISC-V changes, the build system, tool chain and
freebsd-update, network stack stability improvements, machine-dependent
optimizations, new kernel interfaces, DTrace bug fixes, documentation
improvements, and others.

Continuous Integration and Quality Assurance

The Foundation provides a full-time staff member and funds projects on
improving continuous integration, automated testing, and overall quality
assurance efforts for the FreeBSD Project.

During the fourth quarter of 2020, Foundation staff continued improving
and monitoring the Project's CI infrastructure, and working with experts
to fix the failing builds and the regressions found by tests. The work
was focused on pre-commit tests and development of the CI staging
environment. The other main working item is working on the VCS migration
to change the src and doc source from Subversion to Git. There are also
many work-in-progress tasks like analysis and improve the tests of
non-x86 platforms.

See the FreeBSD CI section of this report for completed work items and
detailed information.

Supporting FreeBSD Infrastructure

The Foundation provides hardware and support to improve the FreeBSD
infrastructure. Last quarter, we continued supporting FreeBSD hardware
located around the world. We coordinated efforts between the new NYI
Chicago facility and clusteradm to start working on getting the facility
prepared for some of the new FreeBSD hardware we are planning on
purchasing. NYI generously provides this for free to the Project. We
also worked on connecting with the new owners of the NYI Bridgewater
site, where most of the existing FreeBSD infrastructure is located.

Some of the purchases we made for the Project last quarter to support
infrastructure includes:

-   5 application servers to run tasks like bugzilla, wiki, website,
    cgi, Phabricator, host git, etc.

-   1 server to replace the old pkg server, which will provide a lot
    more IOPS to avoid the slowdowns seen during peak times of the day
    where the disks simply cannot keep up with the request volume.

-   1 server for exp-runs and to make them faster.

-   1 server to build packages more frequently.

FreeBSD Advocacy and Education

A large part of our efforts are dedicated to advocating for the Project.
This includes promoting work being done by others with FreeBSD;
producing advocacy literature to teach people about FreeBSD and help
make the path to starting using FreeBSD or contributing to the Project
easier; and attending and getting other FreeBSD contributors to
volunteer to run FreeBSD events, staff FreeBSD tables, and give FreeBSD
presentations.

The FreeBSD Foundation sponsors many conferences, events, and summits
around the globe. These events can be BSD-related, open source, or
technology events geared towards underrepresented groups. We support the
FreeBSD-focused events to help provide a venue for sharing knowledge, to
work together on projects, and to facilitate collaboration between
developers and commercial users. This all helps provide a healthy
ecosystem. We support the non-FreeBSD events to promote and raise
awareness of FreeBSD, to increase the use of FreeBSD in different
applications, and to recruit more contributors to the Project.

While we were still unable to attend in-person meetings due to COVID-19,
we were able to attend virtual events at new venues and facilitate the
first online FreeBSD Vendor Summit. In addition to attending and
planning virtual events, we are continually working on new training
initiatives and updating our selection of how-to guides to facilitate
getting more folks to try out FreeBSD.

Check out some of the advocacy and education work we did last quarter:

-   Continued our FreeBSD Fridays series of 101 classes. Topics included
    an Introduction to Capsicum, Introduction to Bhyve, Introduction to
    DTrace, and more. Videos of the past sessions can be found here.
    We'll be back with new sessions in early 2021.

-   Gave a FreeBSD talk at the nerdear.la conference on October 20th.

-   Participated in the podcast: What the Dev: A Dive into the FreeBSD
    Foundation on its 20th Anniversary

-   Promoted the Foundation's 20th Anniversary in the FossBytes article:
    20 Years of The FreeBSD Foundation

-   Continued to promote the FreeBSD Office Hours series. Videos from
    the one hour sessions can be found on the Project's YouTube Channel.
    See the Office Hours section of this report for more information.

-   Added two new How-To Guides: Contributing FreeBSD Documentation and
    How to Submit a Bug Report.

-   Worked with the organizing committee to host the November 2020
    Vendor Summit

-   Promoted the use of FreeBSD in regards to CHERI and ARM's Morello
    Processor

-   Authored a Beginners Guide to FreeBSD for Fosslife.

-   Sponsored All Things Open as a Media Sponsor.

-   Sponsored OpenZFS Developers Summit at the Bronze level.

-   Applied for a virtual stand at FOSDEM 2021.

-   Committed to attend the online Apricot 2021.

Contact: FreeBSD Release Engineering Team <re@FreeBSD.org>

The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is responsible for setting and
publishing release schedules for official project releases of FreeBSD,
announcing code freezes and maintaining the respective branches, among
other things.

During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Release Engineering Team
completed work on 12.2-RELEASE, the third release from the stable/12
branch, released on October 27. Thank you to all involved for the hard
work that went into this release.

Additionally throughout the quarter, several development snapshots
builds were released for the head, stable/12, and stable/11 branches.
Development snapshot builds for 13.0-CURRENT have recently been built
from the Git tree within the project, while further snapshot builds for
12.x and 11.x will continue to be built from Subversion. As we approach
the end of 2020, continued preparations are being put in place for the
upcoming 13.0 release, which will be the first release from Git.

Much of this work was sponsored by Rubicon Communications, LLC
(netgate.com) and the FreeBSD Foundation.

  ------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------

Contact: Cluster Administration Team <clusteradm@FreeBSD.org>

The FreeBSD Cluster Administration Team consists of the people
responsible for administering the machines that the Project relies on
for its distributed work and communications to be synchronised. In this
quarter, the team has worked on the following:

-   Finished setting up the Malaysia mirror site, generously hosted by
    the Malaysian Research & Education Network. Traffic from Oceania and
    parts of Asia is now going to this mirror instead of farther away
    sites like Japan and California.

-   Upgraded the package building machines to a version of head from
    mid-October 2020.

-   Upgraded developer machines in the cluster (freefall, ref* and
    universe*) to a version of head from mid-October 2020.

-   Installed eight new x86 servers in our New Jersey site: five
    application servers, two package builders and one mirror server.

    -   The new mirror server is in production (pkg0.nyi.freebsd.org).

    -   The two package builders are in production.

    -   Two of the application servers have been put into production as
        the Git source of truth and the cgit web frontend, respectively.

-   Installed two new aarch64 servers in our New Jersey site. Both are
    now building aarch64 packages.

-   Fixed package mirror synchronisation for powerpc64 packages.

-   Rebuilt the ZFS pool on the UK mirror server (pkg0.bme.freebsd.org)
    for better I/O parallelism. This should improve download performance
    especially at peak times.

-   Ongoing systems administration work:

    -   Accounts management for committers.

    -   Backups of critical infrastructure.

    -   Keeping up with security updates in 3rd party software.

Work in progress:

-   Hardware refreshing for web services, backup version control system
    in NYI

-   Upgrading production machines in the FreeBSD cluster to 12.2

    -   Most machines have been upgraded as of mid-December 2020

    -   Remaining machines will be decommissioned / repurposed after
        services migrate to newer hardware

-   Supporting Git migration and infrastructure setup

-   powerpc pkgbuilder/ref/universal machines

-   Preparations for a new mirror site in Australia, to be hosted by IX
    Australia.

-   Setup Brazil (BRA) mirror.

-   Review the service jails and service administrators operation.

-   Searching for more providers that can fit the requirements for a
    generic mirrored layout or a tiny mirror.

The FreeBSD CI team maintains the continuous integration system of the
FreeBSD project. The CI system firstly checks the committed changes can
be successfully built, then performs various tests and analysis over the
newly built results. The artifacts from those builds are archived in the
artifact server for further testing and debugging needs. The CI team
members examine the failing builds and unstable tests and work with the
experts in that area to fix the code or adjust test infrastructure. The
details of these efforts are available in the weekly CI reports.

During the fourth quarter of 2020, we continued working with the
contributors and developers in the project to fulfil their testing needs
and also keep collaborating with external projects and companies to
improve their products and FreeBSD.

Important changes:

-   doc jobs were changed to use git to follow VCS migration:

  -------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contact: René Ladan <portmgr-secretary@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: FreeBSD Ports Management Team <portmgr@FreeBSD.org>

The Ports Management Team is responsible for overseeing the overall
direction of the Ports Tree, building packages, and personnel matters.
Below is what happened in the last quarter.

For the last quarter the dashboard looks like:

-   41500 ports (including flavors)

-   2516 open PRs of which 625 are unassigned

-   8715 commits to the HEAD branch by 164 committers

-   420 commits to the 2020Q4 branch by 59 committers

Compared to the third quarter, the PR statistics mostly stayed the same.
There

were slightly fewer commits by the same number of people. The number of
ports again grew steadily, this time by almost 4 percent.

During the last quarter, we welcomed Juray Lutter (otis@) as a new ports
committer and said goodbye to cpm, jadawin, knu, araujo, mmokhi and
scottl.

Traditionally merges to the quarterly ports branches, which are more
conservative versions of the HEAD tree, required approval of either the
Ports Security Team (ports-secteam@) or portgmr@. There were already a
number of blanket approvals for tested commits, ranging from fixing
typing mistakes to upgrading web browsers to their latest version. As of
last December, all ports committers are free to merge on their own,
lessening the burden on ports-secteam@.

Patent limitations have been disconnected from the license framework,
given that patents are a complex topic with implications varying from
one jurisdiction to another.

The last quarter saw a number of updates to default versions of ports:

-   librsvg2: "rust" on supported platforms, "legacy" otherwise

-   Mono: 5.10

-   FPC switched to 3.2.0

-   GCC switched to 10 for powerpc64le

-   Lazarus switched to 2.0.10

-   Ruby switched to 2.7.X

-   Samba switched to 4.12

During the last quarter, a new virtual category was added: "education"
for ports

that for instance help the user to learn about a certain topic or help
facilitating examinations.

The @shell and @sample keywords have been rewritten in Lua which makes
root-dir compliant (see pkg -r) and ensures they are Capsicum-sandboxed.

The last quarter also saw updates to several user-facing ports:

-   Firefox 84.0.1

-   Firefox-esr 78.6.0

-   Chromium 87.0.4280.88

-   Ruby 2.7.2

-   Qt5 5.15.2

-   XFce 4.16

As always, antoine@ was busy running exp-runs, 37 this quarter, testing:

-   various ports upgrades

-   changing sys/cdefs.h in base

-   adding "set pipefail" to most framework scripts to catch errors
    earlier

-   changing the default locale to C.UTF-8 in base

-   using bsdgrep as /usr/bin/grep

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Office Hours

Contact: Allan Jude <allanjude@freebsd.org>
Contact: Ed Maste <emaste@freebsd.org>

During the final quarter of 2020 three office hours sessions were held.

The first was hosted by the core team in a time slot conducive to Asia
and Australia, covering topics including the transition to git,
recruiting for project teams, and core's todo list.

The second was hosted by the git transition team, and answered attendee
questions about the transition to git and how it would impact the
project's workflows.

The third session was hosted by bhyve maintainers Peter Grehan and John
Baldwin to present recent development efforts and answer questions about

A long-standing goal of the FreeBSD project is for the base system to
migrate to modern, copyfree or more permissively licensed components. In
this quarter, the following components have been successfully removed or
replaced:

-   gdb (removed in favor of lldb in base or devel/gdb in ports)

-   gnugrep (replaced with bsdgrep)

-   libgnuregex (removed)

The following component(s) have yet to be claimed. Some replacement
prospects

may be listed on the above-linked wiki page. Interested parties are
welcome to evaluate the options to restart the discussion:

-   dialog

-   gcov (kernel)

The following component(s) have a principal investigator to coordinate
work.

Note that partial completion likely means that a component is partially
compatible, but could use evaluation and patches to bring parity with
the component that it is replacing.

The Git working group largely completed the migration of the doc and src
(base system) trees from Subversion to Git in December 2020. We are
currently working on some minor outstanding issues and preparing for the
ports tree migration.

We set up new hosts to serve as the Git repositories and mirrors, and
developed commit hooks for restrictions on commits to various branches,
generation of commit mail, and similar needs.

The doc tree migration occurred on December 8th and 9th. After the
conversion some minor changes to the documentation build infrastructure
were necessary.

The src tree migration occurred between December 20th and 23rd for the
main branch; some additional tasks occurred over the next week or so.
These included enabling the stable branches, vendor (contrib) code
updates, and the git->svn gateway. We are translating stable branch
commits to Subversion for the stable/11 and stable/12 branches and
associated release branches. This allows FreeBSD users who follow stable
branches or releases to continue using existing processes and tooling.

An experimental Git conversion of the ports tree is available at the
link above. There are some unique challenges in the ports tree (that do
not impact the doc or src repos in the same way), so additional work is
ongoing. The window for migrating the ports tree is immediately prior to
a quarterly branch, so we anticipate a migration at the end of March
2021. Over the next few months testing of the experimental ports repo is
very welcome.

Process documentation for developer and user interaction with FreeBSD's
repositories is currently available in Warner's GitHub repository at the
link above. It will be moved to the FreeBSD developer's handbook and/or
other suitable locations following the documentation project's asciidoc
conversion.

The working group is experimenting with two permissively-licensed tools
that are compatible with Git servers or repositories. Game of Trees is a
version control system that is compatible with Git repositories. It is
being developed by Stefan Sperling along with some OpenBSD developers
and other contributions.

John Mehr's gitup is a minimal, dependency-free program that clones and
synchronizes a local tree with a remote repository. It is intended for
use cases that would otherwise be served by tools like portsnap.

Linux compatibility layer update

Contact: Edward Tomasz Napierala <trasz@FreeBSD.org>

Linuxulator improvements have been ongoing for the last two years, with
support from the FreeBSD foundation over a few distinct project grants
as well as contributions from the community. The goal of this project is
to improve FreeBSD's ability to execute unmodified Linux binaries.
Current status is being tracked at Linux app status Wiki page. The work
has now shifted from command-line apps to desktop applications.

There wasn't much Foundation-sponsored work done during this quarter,
apart from extending fuse(4) to make it possible to run Linux FUSE
servers, which is one of the things required to run AppImages. The
Foundation-sponsored effort will continue into the first quarter of 2021
in order to make sure the 13.0-RELEASE ships with Linuxulator in a good
shape.

There was a very significant contribution from Conrad Meyer in the form
of SO_PASSCRED setsockopt(2) support, PR_SETDUMPABLE and PR_GETDUMPABLE
prctl(2) flags, and also CLONE_FS and CLONE_FILES handling. This, along
with some more cleanups and improvements, leads to working Linux
Chromium; it has been tested with Netflix and Spotify clients. It still
requires three flags (--no-sandbox --no-zygote --in-process-gpu) to be
passed on the command line to work around missing functionality, though.
Also, the name_to_handle_at(2) and open_by_handle_at(2) syscalls are now
supported. There are also much better debug messages for unrecognized
socket options.

The LLDB project builds on libraries provided by LLVM and Clang to
provide a great modern debugger. It uses the Clang ASTs and the
expression parser, LLVM JIT, LLVM disassembler, etc so that it provides
an experience that “just works”. It is also blazing fast and more
permissively licensed than GDB, the GNU Debugger.

LLDB is the default debugger in Xcode on macOS and supports debugging C,
Objective-C, and C++ on the desktop and iOS devices and the simulator.

FreeBSD includes LLDB in the base system. At present, it has some
limitations in comparison with the GNU GDB debugger, and does not yet
provide a complete replacement. It used to rely on an obsolete plugin
model in LLDB that was a growing technical debt. This project aimed to
bring LLDB closer to a fully featured replacement for GDB, and therefore
for FreeBSD to feature a modern debugger for software developers.

The legacy monolithic target support executed the application being
debugged in the same process space as the debugger. The modern LLDB
plugin approach, used on other supported targets, executes the target
process under a separate lldb-server process. This improves reliability
and simplifies the process / thread model in LLDB itself. In addition,
remote and local debugging is now performed using the same approach.

After the migration to the new process model on 32 and 64-bit x86 CPUs,
the project focused on reviewing the results of LLDB’s test suite and
fixing tests as time permits.

During the Moritz Systems work, the FreeBSD Project gained numerous
important improvements: in the kernel, userland base libraries (the
dynamic loader) and the LLVM toolchain FreeBSD support.

The introduced changes are expected to be shipped with LLDB 12.0, and
where applicable in FreeBSD 13.0.

The overall experience of FreeBSD/LLDB developers and advanced users on
this rock solid Operating System reached the state known from other
environments. Furthermore, the FreeBSD-focused work also resulted in
generic improvements, enhancing the LLDB support for Linux and NetBSD.

NetApp has started an effort to upstream bug fixes and other
improvements from the ONTAP code line into FreeBSD. These changes
benefit the FreeBSD community by providing many fixes that NetApp has
made over the past few years, while allowing NetApp to reduce the number
of customizations needed when bringing in the latest FreeBSD changes
back into the ONTAP tree.

NetApp has partnered with Klara to facilitate this project, to help
identify interesting and useful changes to send upstream, to rework and
generalize those changes as required to make them suitable for
upstreaming, and to shepherd them through the FreeBSD code review
process.

During the fourth quarter, Klara has made 40 upstream fixes in the
FreeBSD kernel in various subsystems including geom, dev, amd64, net,
kern, netinet, and several other areas of the tree on behalf of NetApp.

NetApp intends to continue to sponsor this effort throughout 2021.

NFS over TLS implementation

Contact: Rick Macklem <rmacklem@freebsd.org>

In an effort to improve NFS security, an Internet Draft titled "Towards
Remote Procedure Call Encryption By Default" specifies use of TLS 1.3 to
encrypt all data traffic on a Sun RPC connection used for NFS.

Although NFS has been able to use sec=krb5p to encrypt data on the wire,
this requires a Kerberos environment and, as such, has not been widely
adopted. It also required that encryption/decryption be done in
software, since only the RPC message NFS arguments are encrypted. Since
Kernel TLS is capable of using hardware assist to improve performance
and does not require Kerberos, NFS over TLS may be more widely adopted,
once implementations are available.

The coding for this project has now been completed. All required changes
to the NFS and kernel RPC code have been committed to the head/current
kernel and will be in FreeBSD13. The daemons can now be built from a
port that depends upon the security/openssl-devel port of Openssl3 that
includes patches for support of ktls. The port for the daemons is called
sysutils/nfs-over-tls and should be committed to the ports framework
soon. In the meantime, the port can easily be fetched, as described in
https://people.freebsd.org/~rmacklem/nfs-over-tls-setup.txt.

To support clients such as laptops, the daemons that perform the TLS
handshake may optionally handle client X.509 certificates from a site
local CA. There are now exports(5) options to require client(s) to
provide a valid X.509 certificate. The case where a "user" name is
stored in the certificate and is used to map all RPC credentials to that
user is probably in violation of the Internet Draft. This is only
enabled when the "-u" command line option is provided to
rpc.tlsservd(8).

The code is now available for testing. See:
https://people.freebsd.org/~rmacklem/nfs-over-tls-setup.txt

Setting up system(s) for testing still requires building a custom kernel
with "options KERN_TLS" from recent head/FreeBSD13 sources plus
installing the port for the daemons, as explained by the above document.

The main limitation in the current implementation is that it uses TLS1.2
and not TLS1.3, as required by the Internet Draft. This should change
once the KERN_TLS rx patch includes TLS1.3 support.

Third party testing would be appreciated.

OpenBSM is a crucial part of FreeBSD, which provides auditing features
for the operating system. OpenBSM is incorporated into FreeBSD and
macOS. Both Apple and FreeBSD have currently made changes to the OpenBSM
framework, which weren't upstreamed. This small project aims to
consolidate these changes and upstream them to the OpenBSM github
repository, so that both development efforts can be merged to FreeBSD
later on. The tricky part of this project is the manual comparison,
since Apple doesn't provide any changelogs.

I am currently working on the macOS Catalina sources and hopefully Apple
will release the sources of macOS Big Sur in time for FreeBSD 13.

In October Clang/LLVM was updated to 11.0.0, followed by a number of bug
fixes from upstream, including improvements for a number of Tier-2
architectures. We also enabled the -fstack-clash-protection flag to
enable compiler mitigation for the "stack clash" vulnerability and are
coordinating with upstream.

Upstream LLDB support for FreeBSD improved substantially over the last
quarter, as detailed elsewhere in this report. These improvements will
make it into the FreeBSD base system early in 2021 when LLVM is next
updated to 12.0. As also mentioned elsewhere, we removed the obsolete
copy of GDB 6.1.1.

The ELF Tool Chain received a number of bug fixes, as well as support
for readelf -z (handling compressed ELF debug sections) and an
improvement to addr2line to report based on labels when other debug
information is not available. We are working to upstream these changes
to the ELF Tool Chain project.

There are a number of open issues and opportunities for improvements in
various ELF Tool Chain components. Contributions in these areas are very

Since FreeBSD 11, the default random(4) implementation is based on the
Fortuna (2003) design by Ferguson and Schneier. At a high level, Fortuna
accumulates entropy into a series of pools, and reseeds a single
generator from some of these pools according to some criteria.

In 2019, Ferguson (at Microsoft) published a whitepaper on the design of
the Windows 10 system random number generator. Fenestras X is a
random(4) implementation based on the published Windows 10 design.

The Fenestras X / Windows 10 design is similar to Fortuna, so it is
probably most interesting to describe their differences:

-   Fenestras X has per-CPU generators seeded from a root generator.
    Fortuna only has the root generator. This change eliminates lock
    contention between random(4) readers running on multiple cores.

-   Generators in Fenestras X form a tree from the root RNG. When read,
    generators efficiently check if their parent generator has been
    seeded with newer entropy. If so, child generators reseed themselves
    before serving the read operation. This is integrated with
    arc4random(9), as well as userspace arc4random(3).

-   Fenestras X generators are buffered. Requests smaller than some
    arbitrary threshold (currently 128 bytes) are served from the
    buffer. Bytes read from the buffer are securely erased when they are
    consumed. The buffer is refreshed if the request consumes more bytes
    than were available in the buffer. This amortizes the cost of
    rekeying and generating output from a cryptographic CTR-mode cipher,
    which is especially slow with AES.

There are other important differences, and readers interested in system
CSPRNGs

should read Ferguson's whitepaper. It is short and accessible. For more
information on the FreeBSD implementation, please see the SVN commit
messages — especially r366620.

The Fenestras X implementation is available in CURRENT, but disabled by
default. (The default remains Fortuna.) At this time, you must set the
RANDOM_FENESTRASX option in your custom kernel configuration and rebuild
your kernel to use the new design. There are no known bugs or weaknesses
relative to the Fortuna implementation.

Future work and call to action:

-   Additional design review, implementation review, and testing is
    welcome.

-   Additional entropy sources: we could use implementations of some of
    the sources described in the whitepaper, in both Fortuna and
    Fenestras X. In particular, we're missing a jitter entropy source.

The performance of pf was not as good as it could be. Some investigation
with the invaluable hwpmc tooling eventually pointed to very poor cache
behaviour. The longest_lat_cache.miss event was very informative.

This turned out to be due to pf doing packet and byte counting in
states, rules and interfaces.

The pf code took the very straightforward approach of having a simple
uint64_t variable and incrementing it for every packet. The downside of
this is that when multiple cores do it simultaneously the CPU ends up
having to write this to memory very often, slowing packet processing
down greatly. Happily the counter(9) framework is designed for this
exact situation.

One additional complication is that pf uses the same structure
definitions for its internal data as it uses for configuration from user
space. To avoid breaking user space these data structures have been
decoupled. That is, where pf_rule used to be used both to set rules via
the ioctl() interface and to evaluate rules while processing packets we
now only use pf_rule for configuration. The new pf_krule structure is
used when evaluating packets. This allows us to change the pf_krule
structure, to change uint64_t to counter_u64_t, without affecting user
space.

Olivier Cochard-Labbé tested the full set of changes, and found
(depending on hardware) substantial improvements in throughput.

IP Routing lookup improvements

  --------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------

  Add modular routing lookup framework.   URL: https://reviews.freebsd.org/D27401
  --------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------

Contact: Alexander Chernikov <melifaro@FreeBSD.org>

This work adds a fib lookup framework, allowing to attach custom IP
lookup algorithms to any routing table on the fly. It allows to use more
performant and efficient lookup algorithms, dynamically selected based
on the number of routes in the routing table. Finally, it provides an
implementation of modified DIR-24-8 for IPv4/IPv6, speeding IP lookups
for the large-fib use case.

This work is a part of a larger effort to modernise the routing
subsystem.

Background

FreeBSD runs diverse workloads on both low-end and high-end devices,
resulting in different networking/memory requirements for each case.
Small boxes with a couple of routes are different from routers with
full-view. IPv4 lookups are different from IPv6 ones. Conditions can
change dynamically: one may easily reconfigure a system to receive full
view instead of a default route.

Currently, FreeBSD uses radix (compressed binary tree) to perform all
unicast route manipulations, including routing lookups. Radix
implementation requires storing key length in each item, allowing to use
sockaddrs, transparently supporting virtually any address family. This
flexibility comes at a cost: radix is relatively slow, cache-unfriendly
and adds locking to the hot path. Finally, radix is closely coupled to
the rest of the system, making it hard to switch to something else.

Implementation overview

Overview

Modular fib IP lookup framework has been designed to address flexibility
and performance requirements.

It keeps system radix as the "control plane" source of truth,
simplifying actual algorithms implementation. It allows dynamic load new
algorithms as the kernel modules and abstracts most OS-specific details,
reducing algorithm "glue" code. It automatically adapts to the current
system state by picking the best matching algorithm for the routing
table on-the-fly.

The following algorithms are provided by default.

IPv4:

-   bsearch4 (lockless binary search in a specially-crafted IP array),
    tailored for small-fib (less than 16 routes)

-   radix4_lockless (lockless immutable radix, re-created on every
    routing table change), tailored for small-fib (less than 1000
    routes)

-   radix4 (base system radix backend)

-   dpdk_lpm4 (DPDK DIR24-8-based lookups), lockless datastructure
    optimised for large-fib ( D27412 )

IPv6:

-   radix6_lockless: lockless immutable radix, re-created on every
    routing table change, tailored for small-fib (less than 1000 routes)

-   radix6: wrapper around existing system radix

-   dpdk_lpm6: DPDK DIR24-8-based lookups, lockless datastructure
    optimised for large-fib ( D27412 )

Performance changes

Micro benchmarks (i7-7660U, single-core lookups, 2048 destinations,
benchmark code in D27604).

IPv4:

-   8 routes: radix4: ~20mpps, radix4_lockless: ~25mpps, bsearch4:
    ~69mpps, dpdk_lpm4: ~67 mpps

-   700k routes: radix4_lockless: 3.3mpps, dpdk_lpm4: 46mpps

IPv6:

-   8 routes: radix6_lockless: ~20mpps, dpdk_lpm6: ~70mpps

-   100k routes: radix6_lockless: ~14mpps, dpdk_lpm6: ~57mpps

Forwarding performance:

-   +10-15% IPv4: small-fib, bsearch4

-   +25% IPv4: full-view, dpdk_lpm4

-   +20% IPv6: full-view, dpdk_lpm6

other modern networking OSes.

This work is a part of on-going efforts to modernize the routing
subsystem.

Background

Initial FreeBSD multipath implementation, RADIX_MPATH, was added back in
2008. It was based on the radix changes and represented multipath routes
as a linked-list of chained paths. It was not fully finished and tested,
resulting in many crash reports.

Implementation overview

Multipath-related change changes are based on the introduction of the
concept of next hops. Nexthops are separate data structures, containing
the necessary information to perform packet forwarding. They are shared
among the routes, providing more pre-computed cache-efficient data while
requiring less memory. Interested readers can find a more detailed
description in D24141. They can find another overview in Nexthop objects
talk describing Linux kernel implementation.

Multipath implementation extends the nexthop concept further by
introducing nexthop groups. Nexthop group is simply an array of
nexthops, compiled according to each nexthop relative weight.

Each route has a pointer to either nexthops or a nexthop group,
decoupling lookup algorithm from the routing stack internals. Both
nexthops and nexthop groups are immutable and use epoch(9)-backed
reclamation.

Thunderbolt3/USB4 stack

Contact: Scott Long <scottl@freebsd.org>

This project implements a driver stack for Thunderbolt3 and USB4. These
technologies differ radically from USB3 and prior, and require
completely new drivers for the host interface adapter and topology as
well as configuration management layers. At their most fundamental
level, a TBT3/USB4 topology appears as PCI bridges and buses, and
attached devices appear as either PCI devices, USB3 devices, or
DisplayPort devices. Early TBT3 controllers don't even appear in the
system topology unless a TBT3 device is plugged in. These early TBT3
systems also implement a security policy meant to protect against
unauthorised or malicious devices, though that scheme has been proven to
not be effective and has been removed from later TBT3 and USB4
implementations. Besides security control, the TBT3/USB4 stack controls
power management and topology hotplug.

The FreeBSD driver currently supports Alpine Ridge and Ice Lake TBT3
controllers, and can perform basic security validation and topology
awareness. USB4 support as well as full connection manager and power
management support is still being worked on. The current driver will be
committed to FreeBSD in early January 2021.

Though this work is not sponsored, it has been done with the
encouragement and support of the FreeBSD Foundation and Netgate.

Vectored AIO

Contact: Alan Somers <asomers@FreeBSD.org>

POSIX AIO is a facility for asynchronous I/O to files and devices.
FreeBSD's implementation is efficient, especially when writing to disk
files. But a long-standing defect in the standard API is a lack of
vectored functions. That is, there is no asynchronous equivalent of
pwritev(2) and preadv(2). A common workaround is to use lio_listio(2)
instead. However, that has several drawbacks. It's more effort for the
programmer, it might return early with only a subset of the operations
completed, it requires more total syscalls, and there is no guarantee
that the operations will complete in-order.

This quarter I added two new syscalls: aio_writev(2) and aio_readv(2).
They work just like their non-vectored counterparts, but they take an
array of iovec elements, just like pwritev and preadv. You can't use
them in combination with lio_listio, but that could be added in the
future.

ZSTD Compression in ZFS

Contact: Allan Jude <allanjude@freebsd.org>

Zstandard (ZSTD) is a modern high-performance compression algorithm
designed to provide the compression ratios of gzip while offering much
better performance. ZSTD has been adopted in FreeBSD for a number of
other uses, including compressing kernel crash dumps, as a replacement
for gzip or bzip for compressing log files, and for future versions of
pkg(8).

This effort to complete the integration of ZSTD into ZFS is funded by
the FreeBSD Foundation.

During the four quarter the final tasks in the project to integrate ZSTD
into OpenZFS were completed.

Completed milestones in this project:

-   Integrated ZSTD in the FreeBSD boot loader (Warner Losh
    imp@freebsd.org)

-   Added a section to the FreeBSD Handbook ZFS chapter explaining ZSTD

-   Wrote a FreeBSD Journal Article explaining considerations when
    selecting a suitable compression level

-   Monitored for bug reports after the changes were integrated into
    -CURRENT

With all of these changes in place, it is now possible to boot from
pools

compressed with zstd or zstd-fast. For comparison, a standard
installation of FreeBSD 13 (without debug symbols) uncompressed is 1175
MB, and when compressed with LZ4, is only 570 MB (2.15x) but when
compressed with ZSTD's default level of 3 is only 417 MB (3.00x), and
with the maximum level, 19, only 374 MB (3.36x).

Architectures

Updating platform-specific features and bringing in support for new
hardware platforms.

arm64 platform updates

Contact: Mitchell Horne <mhorne@FreeBSD.org>

In the interest of seeing the arm64 architecture promoted to Tier-1
status, an effort was undertaken to test building and serving of release
and patch-level updates via freebsd-update(1). The conclusion of this
investigation is that the process works with very few changes required;
a small tweak is needed for the update build scripts, and a minor bugfix
in the bsdiff(1) utility was committed. The hope is that the project can
begin providing security updates for the platform with the release of
FreeBSD 13.0, removing the requirement that users compile these updates
from source.

Added this quarter was arm64 support for the new ossl(4) crypto driver.
This driver provides acceleration of SHA-1 and SHA-2 cryptographic
operations by leveraging OpenSSL's assembly routines. These routines
will detect and use optimized instructions, as supported by the CPU.
This support benefits userland applications via the cryptodev(4) device,
and in-kernel consumers of the crypto(9) interface, such as the IPSec
Authentication Header protocol and kernel TLS.

Finally, work was done to add the necessary machine-dependent bits for
the kernel's gdb(4) interface. This enables remote debugging of the
kernel with gdb(1) over a serial line.

Contact: IRC #freebsd-riscv on freenode

The FreeBSD/RISC-V project is providing support for running FreeBSD on
the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture.

This quarter saw a number of improvements and bugfixes from committers
and contributors alike. A few small items from this quarter:

-   Added riscv64 LINT kernel config plus CI job
    (FreeBSD-head-riscv64-LINT)

-   Switched emulators/riscv-isa-sim to official upstream and updated to
    2020-11-02 snapshot

-   Created sysutils/u-boot-sifive-fu540, a u-boot port for the HiFive
    Unleashed

-   Improved SBI extension support

Further progress was made this quarter in building ports for RISC-V.
Build and

runtime issues with large dependencies devel/python-setuptools and
devel/glib20 were fixed, enabling several thousand skipped ports. There
is some in-progress work to address failures in other significant ports,
such as devel/nspr and databases/sqlite3. By addressing some of these
small-effort issues, some 15000+ ports can now be built for the platform
with qemu-user-static.

Finally, December saw the arrival of the first riscv64 weekly
development snapshots. This includes the usual memstick installer, a
virtual machine image, and a generic SD card image. There are still some
minor tweaks to be made, but this marks a significant step forward for
the platform, and lowers the barrier of entry for running a
FreeBSD/RISC-V system. This also means that FreeBSD 13 will likely be
the first downloadable release for the architecture. For those
interested in trying out the VM image for themselves, see the Quick
Start instructions on the wiki.

Userland Programs

Changes affecting the base system and programs in it.

Dual-stack ping command

Contact: Alan Somers <asomers@FreeBSD.org>

The venerable ping command has until now only supported IPv4. A separate
utility, ping6, was originally written by WIDE as a research tool to
develop IPv6. As a research tool, it didn't need IPv4 support, but since
then, it's been put to practical use by countless developers and
sysadmins everywhere.

The ping/ping6 split has been a perennial complaint. It's annoying that
two separate commands are needed, even though they do almost exactly the
same thing. This quarter, I merged Ján Sučan's GSoC work, which merged
the two commands. Now ping can handle either protocol, based on the -4
and -6 switches, or based on the format of the target. A ping6 hard link
is provided for backwards compatibility.

The KDE on FreeBSD project aims to package all of the software produced
by the KDE Community for the FreeBSD ports tree. The software includes a
full desktop environment called KDE Plasma, graphics applications,
instant-messengers, a video-editing suite, as well as a tea timer and
hundreds of other applications that can be used on any FreeBSD machine.

The KDE team (kde@) is part of desktop@ and x11@ as well, building the
software stack to make FreeBSD beautiful and usable as a daily-driver
graphics-based desktop machine.

This quarter the kde@ team:

-   Landed the October, November and December updates to KDE
    Applications and to KDE Plasma

-   Landed all of the bi-weekly KDE Frameworks releases

-   Updated Qt to 5.12.2, including Qt5 WebEngine

-   Followed up with two cmake patch releases

-   Followed up one ninja patch release

There was lots of infrastructural work and individual application

updates and a new Matrix client from the KDE community as well, which we
typically fail to administer and write about so this report is fairly
short with mostly big-ticket items. We had fun, we chased the things
that are most useful to us, and got through the year. Here's to next
year with actually seeing FreeBSD people again.

I (adridg@) would like to especially thank Kai Knoblich (kai@) for
chasing WebEngine: that's a huge and painful codebase to deal with, and
here we are, all up-to-date.

Work during this quarter focused on providing the latest stable release
of LibreOffice suite and companion apps to all FreeBSD users.

Latest and quarterly ports branches got a series of updates of the
LibreOffice suite from 7.0.1 thru 7.0.4 releases, compilation patches
for all Tier 1 architectures, and updates of all companion libraries.
Some of our local and critical to build patches were sent to and
accepted by upstream.

Meanwhile, our WIP repository was moved to new home under official
github.org/freebsd resources.

The WIP repository also has a major update with development versions of
the LibreOffice suite, version 7.1.0.0.beta1 for now. Release will be
planned in March, 2021.

We are looking for people to help the project. All unstable work with
LibreOffice snapshots is staged in our WIP repository.

Ports On Non-x86 Architectures

Contact: Mark Linimon <linimon@FreeBSD.org>

It has been some time since the last report on the status of FreeBSD
ports on non-x86 architectures.

Traditionally, we have referred to these as "tier-2 architectures".
However, aarch64 and powerpc64 have aspirations for tier-1. Also,
although riscv64 is currently tier-3, it has aspirations for tier-2.

-   The big news is that, thanks to the FreeBSD Foundation (and the
    assistance of Philip Paeps), FreeBSD now has two new aarch64 boxes,
    which have replaced the previous, badly-aging, alternatives. For the
    first time since August, we once again have up-to-date aarch64
    packages.

-   Thanks to the above, and the work of Emmanuel Vadot and others, some
    bitrot in aarch64 ports has been reversed.

-   Piotr Kubaj (pkubaj@) continues QA on powerpc64 (big-endian) ports.
    Almost everything that is buildable now does so. The Linux ports and
    some of the graphics drivers are excluded. Otherwise, powerpc64 is
    up to parity with amd64.

-   Piotr has also begun the task of bringing powerpc64le
    (little-endian) up to parity with powerpc64. Although several of the
    powerpc64 src committers (and your author) have a fondness for
    big-endian, the fact is that our most feasible path to getting
    graphics capability anywhere near parity with x86 is via the
    little-endian choice.

-   Mark Linimon (linimon@) has begun his own test-builds of ports on
    riscv64 just to ascertain overall buildability. Surprisingly, many
    ports do indeed build. Thanks to contributions from several people
    already working on riscv64, including John Baldwin (jhb@) with an
    LLVM fix, we are now able to build around 20,000 packages. NB: these
    packages are unofficial and not guaranteed.

-   The work of Kyle Evans (kevans@) on chasing bitrot in qemu has been
    key to work on both aarch64 and riscv64. All users are encouraged to
    update to the latest version.

-   Unfortunately mips/mips64 are badly in need of work. The fact that
    devel/libffi does not build on mips64 blocks nearly half the ports
    tree.

Tasklist:

-   We need users of riscv64 to actually test the packages that have
    been built (so far, they have only been tested for buildability).
    Contact linimon@ if you are interested.

-   If anyone is still using mips/mips64 for other than the most trivial
    tasks, we would welcome patches.

Python 2.7 removal from Ports

As of January 2020, Python 2.7 reached its end-of-life after several
years of extensions. Portmgr subsequently started the project of phasing
Python 2.7 out of the Ports Tree by tagging lang/python27 for expiration
on 2020-12-31. Last year, some 740 ports were removed from the Ports
Tree as they were incompatible with Python 3, mostly because these ports
were either unmaintained or abandoned upstream.

During this process, there were several instances of an upstream still
being active but where the upstream have not had the resources yet to
upgrade their software to Python 3. A noticeable example of this is
www/chromium and derived software, such as devel/electron7 and
www/qt5-webengine. Portmgr is currently looking into ideas on how to
minimize the impact of Python 2.7 on the Ports Tree while keeping
Chromium and KDE 5 functional. As various software packages on the
FreeBSD cluster itself also use Python 2.7, portmgr started coordinating
with affected parties on upgrade plans. Currently there are 40 ports
left that directly depend on Python 2.7 to build or run, and an unknown
number of indirect ports. All those ports should eventually be upgraded
to Python 3 or be removed too, ideally some time this year.

Portmgr is currently cleaning up (unused) Python 2.7 code from ports
which do not need Python 2.7. New ports should not be using Python 2.7
anymore, i.e. they should not have USES=python but instead something
like USES=python:3.6+.

So while this all looks rather invasive, it is not feasible to keep
Python 2.7 around for much longer. Over time security vulnerabilities
might show up which will likely no longer be fixed, because the Python
Software Foundation no longer supports Python 2.7. Other problems are
that the software gets outdated over time and thereby loses its
usefulness as part of a development kit.

    mail/mailman

The FreeBSD Xfce team (xfce@) work to ensure the Xfce desktop
environment is maintained and fully functional on FreeBSD.

This quarter the Xfce team are pleased to welcome Xfce 4.16 to the
FreeBSD ports tree!

Some of the highlights of this Xfce 4.16 release:

-   The panel now supports dark mode (enabled by default) and an
    animated autohide transition

-   A new panel plugin dubbed "statustray" which combines both
    StatusNotifier and legacy Systray items

-   Fractional scaling support was added to the display dialog (helpful
    on HiDPI displays)

-   A new tab in the "About Xfce" dialog shows basic system information
    like CPU or GPU type

-   The settings manager has improved search and filter capabilities

-   All settings dialogs now use window decorations drawn by Gtk (client
    side decorations)

-   The "Mime Settings" and "Preferred Applications" dialogs were merged
    into the "Default Applications" dialog

-   The Thunar file manager now supports pause for copy/move operations,
    and queued file transfer

-   Generating thumbnails for .epub (e-book format) was added to tumbler

-   A new default wallpaper and icon theme

-   The application finder now allows for sorting applications by
    "frecency" - a combination of frequency and recency

-   Dropped GTK2 support from all components and plugins

For further details, refer to the Xfce 4.16 upstream release
announcement.

Due to GTK2 and libxfce4gui support being removed, some panel plugins
and libraries will be removed since they no longer work with Xfce 4.16:

-   deskutils/orage

-   deskutils/xfce4-volumed

-   print/xfce4-print

-   science/xfce4-equake-plugin

-   x11/xfce4-embed-plugin

-   x11/xfce4-quicklauncher-plugin

-   x11/xfce4-wmdock-plugin

-   x11-toolkits/libxfce4gui

WARNING: Unfortunately this update can reveal a bug in pkg which can
cause files from the libexo package to be absent after upgrade. To avoid
the issue, upgrade the libexo package by itself before the rest of the
packages, as described in UPDATING entry 20210102.

FreeBSD's nfsstat(8) utility provides a wealth of statistics, but I
wanted to monitor them with Prometheus. Screen-scraping the --libxo
output would've been possible, but some of the stats are preprocessed in
a way that interferes with my Prometheus processing. So I wrote a
separate utility that publishes the raw stats provided by the kernel.
Along the way I found and fixed a few bugs in nfsstat, too. If anybody
is interested, I can add a port for it.

VMWare is a company that produces a commercial hypervisor known as
vSphere ESXi for AMD64 and i386. In early October, they released a tech
demo hypervisor for ARM Aarch64 which runs on ARM ServerReady hardware
as well as single board computers such as the Raspberry Pi 4b (4GB and
8GB models). This new hypervisor is known as VMWare ESXi-ARM Fling.

Since the release of ESXi-ARM Fling, work has been done on both the
hypervisor as well as FreeBSD, to make the two more compatible with one
another. Even though the work was initially done to make these two work
better together, the work overall has been more general purpose for
FreeBSD in support of both bare-metal Aarch64 installations as well as
running FreeBSD under other hypervisors such as QEMU.

An example of others building off of this work is Twitter user astr0baby
getting FreeBSD working under QEMU on a new Apple M1 system.

When ESXi-ARM Fling first released, to get FreeBSD to work under it, the
process required taking the Aarch64 premade VMDK file, uploading it to
the hypervisor storage, and then running a series of CLI commands to
convert the disk image to a supported file format. The initial work done
was to get the FreeBSD Aarch64 ISO bootable and with the required
drivers to complete the install process. With this, users can do fresh
installs of FreeBSD Aarch64 using the same methods they would use for
AMD64 or i386 under ESXi.

The CD-ROM driver's inclusion into FreeBSD 12 barely missed the cut-off
date for 12.2-RELEASE. However, the very first 12.2-STABLE build
published for Aarch64 includes the CD-ROM driver. FreeBSD 13-CURRENT
also includes this driver. Due to this, only 12-STABLE and 13-CURRENT
support fresh CD ISO installations.

The next step was getting the major pieces of virtual hardware working.
This included adding more USB controllers, the vmxnet virtual network
card, and pvscsi para-virtual SCSI drivers added to Aarch64 GENERIC.

There is a known bug in ESXi-ARM Fling's virtual UEFI that prevents
booting from pvscsi, so for the time being the boot device must be on a
virtual disk attached to the SATA controller inside the VM.

ESXi-ARM Fling uses a new virtual SVGA device which currently does not
have working drivers on any platform, as the specifications are not
finalized yet. Due to this, only efi-fb/scfb is available for console
and Xorg for the time being.

The VMCI driver is currently not compiling at all. This driver has
sections of x86 assembly code that will need to be converted over to
ARM. This would be a great area for anyone to look into that is
experienced with converting assembly language!

At ESXi-ARM Fling launch, there was a hypervisor bug preventing more
than 1 vCPU from working inside FreeBSD. This has since been fixed,
allowing up to 8 vCPUs. Going beyond this requires a a patch to FreeBSD,
which was authored by VMWare developer Cypou.

Things that are currently fixed/working:

-   Booting from CD ISO image

-   Virtual USB 2.0 controller

-   Virtual USB 3.1 controller

-   Virtual USB Keyboard

-   Virtual USB Mouse

-   vmxnet3 Virtual Network Card

-   pvscsi Para-Virtual SCSI Storage Controller

-   open-vm-tools Guest Virtual Machine Tools

-   Xorg Enhanced Mouse Driver (untested)

-   Multi-Core CPU (up to 8 vCPUs inside guest)

Things that are still broken:

-   Booting from pvscsi

-   Xorg SVGA Driver

-   vmci Virtual Machine Communication Interface

-   Multi-Core CPU (more than 8 vCPUs)

With all of this done, it has made working on the Aarch64 ports

collection easier by having a high quality virtualization environment
for development and testing. This environment has already been used to
update the ZeroTier port and Facebook's RocksDB used in the MariaDB
port.

FreeBSD now has a Discord chat! Discussion about FreeBSD on Aarch64 in
general takes place in our #embedded channel. Despite the name, we
discuss all levels of ARM development, from large servers, to
virtualized environments, all the way down to single board computers.

CheriBSD extends FreeBSD to implement memory protection and software
compartmentalization features supported by the CHERI instruction-set
extensions. There are three architectural implementations of the CHERI
protection model: CHERI-MIPS, CHERI-RISC-V, and Arm's forthcoming
experimental Morello processor (due late 2021). CheriBSD is a research
operating system with a stable baseline implementation into which
various new research features have been, or are currently being, merged:

-   Arm Morello - In October, we released a developer preview of
    CheriBSD ported to Arm's Morello architecture. This release supports
    a dynamically linked runtime and is generally functional. It was cut
    from a development branch and work is in progress to merge the
    contents of this branch with the CheriBSD main line. We anticipate
    producing a new release from this branch in early 2021.

-   Kernel spatial memory safety (pure-capability kernel) - The current
    CheriBSD kernel is a hybrid C program where only pointers to
    userspace are CHERI capabilities. This ensures that the kernel
    follows the intent of the application runtime and cannot be used to
    defeat bounds on application pointers. We have developed and will
    soon merge a pure-capability kernel where all pointers in the kernel
    are appropriately bounded capabilities. This vastly reduces the
    opportunity for buffer overflows. This spatial memory safety lays
    the groundwork for future work such as device driver
    compartmentalization and kernel temporal safety.

-   Userspace heap temporal memory safety (Cornucopia) - CHERI
    capabilities provide the necessary features to enable robust and
    efficient revocation of freed pointers. With Cornucopia we have
    implemented a light-weight revocation framework providing protection
    from use-after-reallocation bugs with an average cost below 2%. We
    aim to bring these overheads down further over the next year and
    merge this functionality into the mainline CheriBSD.

-   Syncing with upstream FreeBSD - We spent considerable time this
    quarter catching up with FreeBSD-CURRENT. As of the beginning of
    December, we had caught up. Merges are currently paused while we
    work to land Morello and pure-capability kernel changes. In the
    interim, we have performed a test merge between our tree based on
    the legacy export of the FreeBSD tree to git and the new FreeBSD git
    repository. The process went smoothly and is expected to have few
    impacts.

-   We have been working on updating the arm64 bhyve from Politehnica
    University of Bucharest to have it committed to FreeBSD. We have
    been upstreaming initial changes to help support this.

Contact: John-Mark Gurney <jmg@FreeBSD.org>

The Embedded Lab Project's goal is to make SBCs and other devices more
accessible to developers. Despite SBCs often being inexpensive, it is
not inexpensive to maintain them, in terms of the cost of time to keep
them up to date, infrastructure to support them, etc.

The goal of this project is to support and enhance the existing CI work
but also make it easier for developers to test their code and changes on
one, or many different boards.

Once the work is [mostly] complete, I will host a lab that will be
freely available to everyone who has a FreeBSD.org account. Information
about this will be sent once it is closer to launch.

The core part of the architecture is each time a board is reserved via
the API, a new jail is created which contains the serial console tty, an
interface for internet access, and an interface that is connected to the
board's ethernet port (assuming it has one). This allows a clean system
for each run, and allows complete control over the network interfaces to
support netbooting and other development. The jail will have a basic set
of FreeBSD packages installed that matches the board.

Part of the API will also allow power cycling the board to aid in
debugging. This part is relatively extensible, so adding additional
modules to provide additional support should not be difficult.

The API includes support for running interactive commands in the jail.
This will make it easy to script control of the environment, such as
directly running an expect script against the serial console, or even
just running a script in the jail.

The work is progressing well, and currently a single board, a Pine64
A64-LTS, is integrated and working. Board reserves and releases are
working, along with the ability to run commands in the jail via the API.
Power control is functional, and is currently using a PoE smart switch
to control power.

Work has stalled on being able to use the SDWire with an environment due
to power issues. USB is not made for power isolation, which is causing
issues w/ power control. The existing board, the A64-lTS, is using a USB
serial console adapter that is opto-isolated, ensuring that there is no
problems w/ power control. But there I have not found a solution for
high speed USB. I believe that cutting the VBUS (power) line of a USB
cable would allow fine grain power control, but tests have not been
conducted yet.

FreshPorts, and its sister site, FreshSource, have reported upon FreeBSD
commits for 20 years. They cover all commits, not just ports.

FreshPorts tracks the commits and extracts data from the port Makefiles
to create a database of information useful to both port developers and
port users.

For example, https://www.freshports.org/security/acme.sh/ shows the
history of this port, back to its creation in May 2017.

git

The work to become git-ready is mostly complete. Both src and doc
commits are flowing into devgit.freshports.org. Some work is required on
various issues, but nothing that stops the flow of commits into the
database.

Help wanted

Amazon have donated enough to try FreshPorts on AWS. I need help with
the following:

-   getting IPv6 working

-   working with RDS

If you can help with this, please contact me. Thank you.

Thank you

helloSystem

#helloSystem:matrix.org on Matrix

helloSystem is FreeBSD preconfigured as a desktop operating system with
a focus on simplicity, elegance, and usability. Its design follows the
“Less, but better” philosophy. It is intended as a system for “mere
mortals”, welcoming to switchers from a world in which a global menu bar
exists, the Command key is used rather than Control, and applications
are contained in .app bundles.

helloSystem grew out of frustration with usability shortcomings of
existing open source desktop environments. FreeBSD was chosen as the
base because it offers one consistent base system rather than a
fragmented landscape of distributions lacking a common platform.

helloSystem aims at providing a "it just works" out-of-the-box user
experience in which a non-technical user can just use the system without
ever opening the terminal, without having to configure anything, and
without ever seeing white text on a black background scroll by during
system boot. Technologies embraced include DNS-SD/Zeroconf (also known
as Bonjour), IPP Everywhere (also known as AirPrint), eSCL (also known
as AirScan), etc.

Prerelease installable Live ISO images are available.

Help is needed in a number of areas, especially:

-   FreeBSD/kernel: allowing to put the system into a read-only disk
    image with a writable overlay, e.g., using unionfs

-   Qt, Python: writing various easy-to use frontends for
    FreeBSD/OpenZFS functionality, e.g., Disk Utility.app

-   Testing and bugfixing

Contact: Puppet Team <puppet@FreeBSD.org>

Since our last status report a few months ago, the FreeBSD ports tree
has seen the addition of the Choria (sysutils/choria) orchestration
tool, and the Puppet Platform 7 with the Puppet Agent
(sysutils/puppet7), Puppet Server (sysutils/puppetserver7) and PuppetDB
(databases/puppetdb7).

Older versions of Puppet (5 and 6) are still in the ports tree, allowing
a smooth transition, but please note that Puppet 5 will reach EOL soon,
and as it is not compatible with the recent ecosystem provided by
FreeBSD (i.e. it is not compatible with the latest version of Ruby and
depends on old FreeBSD primitives not available anymore), it is
recommended to update at least to Puppet 6 as soon as possible.

Ports depending on Puppet (e.g. sysutils/rubygem-bolt) have been updated
to add options allowing to choose which version of Puppet to depend on.
For now, the default is Puppet 6, but we plan to switch the default to
Puppet 7 in a few weeks, probably when Puppet 5 will have reached EOL.
