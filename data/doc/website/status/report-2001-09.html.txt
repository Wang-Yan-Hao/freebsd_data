Introduction

In the month of September, the FreeBSD Project continued its investment
in long-term projects, including continuing work on a fine-grained SMP
implementation, support for Kernel Schedulable Entities (KSE) supporting
highly efficient threading, and broadening support for modern hardware
platforms, including Intel's new IA64 architecture, UltraSparc, and
PowerPC. Additional focus was placed on the release process, including
work on the release notes infrastructure, support for DVD releases, and
work on a binary updating tool.

Due to the delay in getting the September report out the door, the
November status report will also cover October. During the month of
November, we look forward to BSDCon Europe, the first such event outside
the continental United States. The USENIX conference paper submission
deadlines are also in November, and FreeBSD users and developers are
encouraged to submit to the general and FREENIX tracks. Please see
www.usenix.org for more information.

The project has gained a mailing list, freebsd-binup@FreeBSD.org - and
the source tree has been moved into the projects/ directory in the
FreeBSD CVS repository. Current work is focusing on extending the
FreeBSD package framework, and the client library should be rewritten
and completed by the end of the year.

TODO: make the projects/ hierarchy into a cvsup distribution and add it
to cvs-all. Then update distrib.self.

The FreeBSD C99/POSIX Conformance Project aims to implement all
requirements of the C99 Standard and the latest 1003.1-200x POSIX draft
(currently Draft 7). In cases where aspects of the standard cannot be
followed, those aspects will be documented in the c99(7) or posix(7)
manuals. It is also an aim of this project to implement regression tests
to ensure correctness whenever possible.

Patches that implement the <stdint.h> and <inttypes.h> headers, and
modifications to printf(3) have been developed and will be committed
shortly. They will allow us to use some of the new types C99 introduces,
such as intmax_t and the printf(3) conversion specifier "%j".

The project has moved forward on JDK 1.3.1 development this month, with
the release of two more patchsets. The team is reasonably confident that
the latest patchset is a stable release of the core JDK 1.3.1 tools and
classes, when the default "green" threads subsystem is used. This is
mostly thanks to hard work by Fuyuhiko Maruyama to stabilize and fix the
code. Bill Huey has also been progressing with his work on the "native"
threads subsystem, although this hasn't yet reached the stability of
"green" threads. Another (arguably the) major highlight of the latest
patchset was the integration of NetBSD support by Scott Bartram and
Alistair Crooks (the latter of NetBSD packages fame). Hopefully OpenBSD
support will follow, making it truly a united BSD Java Project.

The build process is now creating four different versions of the libs,
which include support for TVision, Qt, both or none. I created some
first packages from existing ports and installed those libh packages on
my system only using libh's tools, including registering all the files
in the package database, recording their checksums etc. Patches to the
disk editor have been submitted, which include functionality to write
the changes in the fdisk part and initial support for a disk label
editor. We'll soon have a new committer.

FreeBSD/sparc64 port

Contact: Jake Burkholder <jake@FreeBSD.org>
Contact: Thomas Moestl <tmm@FreeBSD.org>

I am pleased to announce that as of 1 AM Friday October 19th, the
sparc64 port boots to single user mode. A few binaries from the base
system have been built and verified to work properly. Much of this work
is still in review for commit, but will be integrated into the cvs tree
as soon as possible. EBus support has been ported from NetBSD, and ISA
support has been written. The PCI host bridge code has stabilized, and
busdma seems to work correctly now. The sio driver has had EBus support
added, and the ATA driver has been modified so that it works on
big-endian systems and uses the busdma API. With these changes, a root
file system can now be successfully mounted from ATA disks on sparc64,
even in DMA mode. The gem driver, which supports Sun GEM and ERI and
Apple GMAC and GMAC2 ethernet adaptor, has been ported from NetBSD but
has not yet had sufficient testing.

This group is for discussion about the startup scripts in FreeBSD,
primarily the scripts in /etc/rc*. Primary focus will be on improvements
and importation of NetBSD's excellent work on this topic.

Alright folks, I finally got off my butt last night and put together a
roadmap for the migration to the new rc.d init scripts that were
imported from NetBSD a long time ago and just sat in the tree.

M1 (Patch included)
Setup infrastructure
Make rcorder compile
Hook rc.subr into the distribution (and mergemaster)
Hook rcorder into the world
Add toggle in rc.conf to switch between rc_ng and current boot scripts

M2
Get FreeBSD to boot with the new boot scripts
Rewrite the /etc/rc.d scripts to work with FreeBSD

M3
Add some FreeBSD specific support into rc.subr

M4
Add true dependency checking to the infrastructure so that starting nfsd
will start mountd and rpcbind
add support into rc.subr
Add dependencies into rc.d scripts

I'd like a couple of people to take a look at this and then I'll submit
a pr for it if there aren't too many objections. I'm expecting M2 to run
into quite a bikeshed, but hey, I got my nice shiny asbestos back from
the cleaners.

based, 1 week after 4.4-RELEASE is announced. To finish this update,
OKAZAKI Tetsurou has imported Ex/Rv macro support on ja-groff-1.17.2_1.
SUZUKI Koichi did most Ex/Rv changes on Japanese manpages. He also find
some issues of these macro usage on some original manpages and filed a

In the last month, not a lot has happened other than settling in of the
big August commit. Largely due to me having a sudden increased workload
at work, and a need for increased time to be spent elsewhere. However
some design work has proceeded. The API has firmed up somewhat and
several people have been reading through what has been done already in
order to be able to help in the next phase.

Milestone 3 will be to have the ability to generate and remove multiple
threads/KSEs per process. Milestone 3 will NOT require that doing so
will be safe. (especially in SMP systems), i.e. locking issues will not
be fully addressed, so while some testing will be possible, it will not
be possible to actually run in this mode with any load.

This will require allocators and destructors for the new structures.
Creation of the syscalls. Generation of an accurate written API for the
userland crew. Writing of the upcall launch code. Production of a
userland test program (not a full thread scheduler). Resolution of some
of the more glaring incompatibilities (e.g. the scheduler) in a
backwards compatible manner. (i.e. if there are no multi threaded
processes on a system it should behave the same as now (and be as
reliable)).

Criteria for knowing when we have reached Milestone 3 is the ability for
a simple process on an unloaded system to perform a series of blocking
syscalls reliably. e.g. open 2 sockets, and send data on one, after
having done a read on another, and then 'respond' in like manner..

Multiple console support

Contact: Jonathan Lemon <jlemon@FreeBSD.org>

Currently, a single device may act as a console at any time, which
requires the user to choose the console device at boot time. With the
upcoming network console support, it is desirable to allow multiple
console devices which behave identically, and to alter consoles while
the kernel is running.

The code is completed, and needs some final polishing to clean up the
rough edges. Console output can be sent to both syscons and sio, (as
well as the network) and when in ddb, input can be taken from any input
source. A small control program allows adding and removing consoles on
the fly.

Netgraph ATM

Contact: Harti Brandt <brandt@fokus.gmd.de>

ATM-Forum LAN-emulation version 2.0 without support for QoS has been
implemented and tested. The ILMI daemon has been modularized into a
general mini-SNMP daemon, an ILMI module and a not yet finished IPOA (IP
over ATM) module.

Network console

Contact: Jonathan Lemon <jlemon@FreeBSD.org>

This project's goal is to add low level network functionality to
FreeBSD. The initial target is to make a network console available for
remote debugging with ddb or gdb. A secondary target is to utilize the
code to perform network crash dumps. The design assumes that the network
card and driver are working, but does not rely on other parts of the
kernel.

Initial development has been fairly rapid, and a minimal TCP/IP stack
has been written. It is currently possible to telnet to a machine which
is at the ddb> prompt and interact with the debugger.

Network device nodes

Contact: Jonathan Lemon <jlemon@FreeBSD.org>

Network devices now support aliases in the form of /dev/netN, where N is
the interface index. Devices may be wired down to a specific index
number by entries in /boot/device.hints of either:

hint.net.<ifindex>.dev="devname" hint.net.<ifindex>.ether="ethernet
address"

Additionally, ifconfig has been updated so that it will accept the alias
name when configuring a device.

Network SMP locking

Contact: Jonathan Lemon <jlemon@FreeBSD.org>

Not much progress has been made this month, with other projects
occupying most of my time. However, reviewing all the code and data
structures had a side benefit; a hash table for inet addresses has been
added. This will significantly speed up interface address lookups in the
case where there are a larger number of interface aliases.

New Mount(2) API

Contact: Maxime Henrion <mux@qualys.com>

We've made some good progress now, and the new nmount(2) syscall is
nearly finished. There is still some work to do to have a working
kernel_mount() and to convert all filesystems to use this new API for
their VFS_MOUNT() functions.

Status is unchanged since last month. Patches have been submitted to get
ppp working under HURD, and mostly under Linux. There are GPL copyright
problems that need to be addressed. Many conflicts are expected after

PowerPC Port

Contact: Benno Rice <benno@FreeBSD.org>

There have been a few major successes in the PowerPC port this month.
Mark Peek has succeeded in getting the FreeBSD/PowerPC kernel cross
compiled on FreeBSD and booting under the PSIM simulator (now in
/usr/ports/emulators/psim-freebsd). I have succeeded in getting the
FreeBSD loader to load and execute kernels using the OpenFirmware found
on Apple Macintosh hardware. Mark is now working on completing some of
the startup and pmap code, while I am taking advantage of the simulator
to work on some interrupt and device issues.

PPP IPv6 Support

Contact: Brian Somers <brian@freebsd-services.com>

The software has been committed to -current and seems functional.
Outstanding issues include dealing with IPV6CP events (linkup & linkdown
scripts) and allocating site-local and global addresses (currently,
``iface add'' is the only way to actually use the link). A bug exists in
-stable (running the not-yet-MFC'd ppp code) whereby routing entries are
disappearing after a time (around 12 or 24 hours). No further details
are yet available.

PRFW provides hooks in the FreeBSD kernel, allowing users to insert
their own checks in system calls and various kernel functions. PRFW is
nearing 0.5, which will incorporate numerous structural changes such as,
much faster per-process hooks, kernel function hooks, plus, a new way of
adding hooks which would enable users to reference hooks by a string.

FreeBSD 4.4-RELEASE was the first release of FreeBSD with its new-style
release documentation. Both English and Japanese versions of these
documents were created. Regularly-built snapshots of -CURRENT and
4-STABLE release documentation are now available on the Web site, but
they require a little HTML infrastructure to make them viewer-friendly.
I intend to continue updating my snapshot site at the URL above, at
least for a little while.

Call for help: The hardware compatibility lists need to be updated in
the areas of the Alpha architecture, USB devices, and PCCARD devices.
I'm looking for volunteers to help; interested parties should contact me
at the email address above. DocBook experience is not required;
familiarity with the hardware above would be very helpful.

Some progress has been made on the proc locking this month. Also, a new
LOCK_DEBUG macro was defined to allow some locking infrastructure to be
more efficient. Kernels now only include the filenames of files calling
mutex, sx, or semaphore lock operations if the filenames are needed.
Also, mutex operations are no longer inlined if any debugging options
are turned on. The ucred API was also overhauled to be more locking
friendly. A group has also started investigating the tty subsystem to
design and possibly implement a locking strategy.

As you know, in march 2001 the version 2.3 of TIRPC has been committed
together with many userland changes. Alfred Perlstein and Ian Dowse have
helped me a lot with the porting effort and if I had problems with
understanding the code.

Most bugs are now fixed, some remaining areas to fix are secure RPC
(keyserv) and unix domain support. I've patches for these area
available. Ian Dowse fixed a lot of outstanding bugs in the rpcbind
binary itself. Thank you Ian !

The plan is now to migrate slowly towards TIRPC 2.8, which is threadsafe
for the server- and clientside. One first patch I've made available on
my URL. TIRPC 2.8 is licensed under the "Sun Standards License Version
1.0" and we have to add some license lines and the license itself to all
modified files.

A example is timed_clnt_create.diff which can be found on the homepage.
