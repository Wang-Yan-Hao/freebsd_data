-   COSCUP 2007 - Conference for Open Source Coders, Users and
    Promoters, Techonology Building 2F, National Science Council,
    Taipei, Taiwan (ROC)
    03 - 04 November, 2007
    COSCUP 2007 is a joint conference of ICOS (International Conference
    on Open Source), to make the open source carnival more exciting. The
    mostly change of COSCUP in 2007 is, the conference is co-organized
    by all local communities in Taiwan, we hope to enlarge the
    participation of local communities during such kind of cooperation.
    Just like the spirit of COSCUP, in this conference, you can be both
    attendee and promoter, and also involve the operation of the
    conference. The major topics in COSCUP 2007 including web-based
    platform and embedded system due to the popularity of Web 2.0 and
    OLPC; the Chinese session, Lightning Talk and System session are the
    most interesting topics for years. There will be some presentations
    and talks about FreeBSD. The program is attractive just like before,
    we invite not only big ones in the community but also developers of
    non-famous local OSS projects, to get more people involved and make
    OSS more brilliant in Taiwan.

-   Course: FreeBSD Kernel Internals, UC Extension Berkeley: Room 211,
    Golden Bear Building, Berkeley, USA
    29 - 03 November, 2007
    This course will provide a firm background in the FreeBSD kernel.
    The course will cover basic kernel services, process structure, the
    FreeBSD jail facility for hosting virtual machines, scheduling,
    signal handling, and virtual and physical memory management. The
    kernel I/O structure will be described showing how I/O is
    multiplexed, special devices are handled, character processing is
    performed, and the buffer pool is managed. The implementation of the
    filesystem and its capabilities, including soft updates and
    snapshots, will be described. The filesystem interface will then be
    described to show how it can be used to support multiple filesystem
    types such as Sun Microsystem's Network File System (NFS). The
    course will also cover the FreeBSD socket-based network
    architecture, layering, and implementation. Socket communications
    primitives and internal layering will be discussed, with emphasis on
    the interfaces between layers; the TCP/IP implementation will be
    used as an example. A discussion of routing issues will be included.
    Other system-related topics include performance measurement, system
    tuning, and security issues. The presentations will emphasize code
    organization, data structure navigation, and algorithms. It will not
    cover machine-specific parts of the system, such as device drivers.
    Saturdays September 29, October 6 and 27, and November 3, 2007;
    9:00AM to 5:30PM Sept. 29 to Nov. 3: Sat., 9 am-5:30 pm (no meetings

-   Course: Building and Running an Open Source Community, UC Extension
    San Francisco: Room 216, South of Market Center, San Francisco, USA
    03 - 03 October, 2007
    The BSD community started at UC Berkeley in the late 1970's. Through
    the 1980's, the BSD software was developed and released from
    Berkeley. In 1992, Berkeley made its final release, 4.4BSD-Lite, an
    open-source version of BSD. Since that time, independent development
    has continued by the FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Darwin, and Dragonfly
    projects. This talk traces the history and structure of the BSD
    community from its start as a small group of paid staff at Berkeley
    up through the thousands of volunteer developers that make up the
    FreeBSD Project of today. It describes how the development structure
    set up at Berkeley was expanded to create a self-organizing project
    that supports an ever growing and changing group of developers
    around the world.

September 2007

-   Course: A Narrative History of BSD, UC Extension San Francisco: Room
    216, South of Market Center, San Francisco, USA
    26 - 26 September, 2007
    Learn the history of the BSD (Berkeley Software Distributions) from
    one of its key developers, who brings the history to life, complete

    community began at the UC Berkeley in the late 1970s. You'll hear
    about the triumphs and defeats of the project and its releases
    during its heyday in the 1980s. The Berkeley era concludes with the
    tumultuous lawsuit, ultimately settled in Berkeley's favor, which
    allowed the final release in 1992 of 4.4BSD-Lite, an open-source
    version of BSD. The talk includes a brief commentary on the FreeBSD,
    NetBSD, OpenBSD, Darwin, and Dragonfly projects that took their
    genesis from the release of 4.4BSD-Lite.
