    local and foreign developers to attend.

    Watch out, another BSD-Day is rising: next April Beastie visits
    Naples to gather BSD people of Italy and Central Europe to meet up!
    This event is an excellent opportunity for BSD developers and
    enthusiasts to present their work to larger audiences, share their
    thoughts with their fellows and reach out for their potential
    partners. Traditionally, the event tries to avoid formalities as it
    does not require the speakers to submit papers or the attendees to
    register or pay an entry fee. However, the invited folks are
    encouraged to a give a brief talk on their favorite BSD topic. The
    goal is to motivate everybody, especially university students to see
    the benefits of our approach and take a chance on working with BSD
    systems.
