Past Events:

October 2018

-   MeetBSD 2018, Intel Campus, Santa Clara, CA, United States
    19 - 20 October, 2018
    MeetBSD 2018 is a mixed unConference format event featuring both
    scheduled talks and community-driven events such as
    birds-of-a-feather meetings and speed geeking sessions.

September 2018

-   EuroBSDcon 2018, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Bucharest,
    Romania
    20 - 23 September, 2018
    EuroBSDcon is the European annual technical conference gathering
    users and developers working on and with 4.4BSD (Berkeley Software
    Distribution) based operating systems family and related projects.
    EuroBSDcon gives the exceptional opportunity to learn about latest
    news from the BSD world, witness contemporary deployment case
    studies, and meet personally other users and companies using BSD
    oriented technologies. EuroBSDcon is also a boiler plate for ideas,
    discussions and information exchange, which often turn into
    programming projects. The conference has always attracted active
    programmers, administrators and aspiring students, as well as IT
    companies at large, which found the conference a convenient and
    quality training option for its staff. We firmly believe that high
    profile education is vital to the future of technology, and hence
    greatly welcome students and young people to this regular meeting.

August 2018

-   2018 Cambridge Devsummit (BSDCam), University of Cambridge Computer
    Laboratory, Cambridge, United Kingdom
    15 - 17 August, 2018
    An unconference style developer summit with a focus on interactive
    topics and sessions that reflect the interests of the attendees. The
    Cambridge devsummit is a slightly longer three-day event without
    associated conference, letting us hold more extended working groups,
    brainstorming sessions, and hacking on topics over several days.
    Past significant focuses have included virtualisation, network
    performance, sandboxing, tracing/debugging, packages and package
    security, teaching, non-x86 architectures such as ARM/MIPS/RISC-V,
    and testing.

-   Essen Hackathon 2018, Linuxhotel Villa Vogelsang, Essen, Germany
    10 - 12 August, 2018
    A weekend hackathon at the Linuxhotel in Essen, Germany. A great
    opportunity to fix bugs, commit code, tinker with devices, discuss
    new ideas, try out new things, and improve FreeBSD.
