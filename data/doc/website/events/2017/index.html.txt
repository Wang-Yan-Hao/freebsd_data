September 2017

-   EuroBSDcon 2017, Espace Saint Martin, Paris, France
    21 - 24 September, 2017
    EuroBSDcon is the European annual technical conference gathering
    users and developers working on and with 4.4BSD (Berkeley Software
    Distribution) based operating systems family and related projects.
    EuroBSDcon gives the exceptional opportunity to learn about the
    latest news from the BSD world, witness contemporary deployment case
    studies, and meet personally other users and companies using BSD
    oriented technologies. EuroBSDcon is also a boiler plate for ideas,
    discussions and information exchange, which often turn into
    programming projects. The conference has always attracted active
    programmers, administrators and aspiring students, as well as IT
    companies at large, which found the conference a convenient and
    quality training option for its staff. We firmly believe that high
    profile education is vital to the future of technology, and hence
    greatly welcome students and young people to this regular meeting.
