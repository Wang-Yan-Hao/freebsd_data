IRC

FreeBSD officially maintains an IRC presence with many channels covering
subjects and topics ranging from general support to contribution and
development. Many project teams have dedicated channels where they plan
and coordinate, so if you have a particular area of interest or just
want to hang out and learn, check out our wiki for more information on
our FreeBSD IRC Channels.
