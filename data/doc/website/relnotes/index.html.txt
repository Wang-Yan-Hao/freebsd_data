Release Documentation

[BSD daemon reading documentation]

Each distribution of FreeBSD includes several documentation files
describing the particular distribution (RELEASE, SNAPSHOTs, etc.). These
files typically include:

-   README: General introduction.

-   Release Notes: Information about changes from the previous release
    of FreeBSD.

-   Hardware Notes: A list of hardware devices known to work with
    FreeBSD.

-   Installation Instructions: A brief guide to installing FreeBSD.

-   Errata: Late-breaking news, including corrections, security
    advisories, and potential problems found after each release.

The release notes, hardware notes, and installation instructions are
customized for each architecture supported by FreeBSD.

RELEASE versions of FreeBSD

The release documentation for each -RELEASE version of FreeBSD (for
example, 12.2-RELEASE) can be found on the releases page of the FreeBSD
web site and on mirror sites.

These files are located in the top-level directory of each distribution.
Both HTML and text forms are usually provided.

Snapshot Versions of FreeBSD

The only release notes provided on the FreeBSD website are for FreeBSD
-RELEASE, not FreeBSD -STABLE or FreeBSD -CURRENT.
