8.1. Synopsis

While FreeBSD is popular as a server for its performance and stability,
it is also well suited for day-to-day use as a desktop. With over 36000
applications available in the FreeBSD ports tree, it is straightforward
to build a customized desktop that can run a wide variety of desktop
applications. This chapter demonstrates how to install popular desktop
environments as well as desktop applications such as web browsers,
productivity software, document viewers, and financial software.

Prerequisites:

-   Readers of this chapter should already understand how to install
    either the X Window System or Wayland on FreeBSD.

-   Readers are instructed throughout this chapter to install official
    packages. Refer to the section on using the ports collection to
    build customized packages from ports.

8.2. Desktop Environments

This section describes how to install and configure some popular desktop
environments on a FreeBSD system. A desktop environment can range from a
simple window manager to a complete suite of desktop applications.

: Table 1. Supported desktop environments

8.2.1. KDE Plasma

KDE Plasma is an easy-to-use desktop environment. This desktop provides
a suite of applications with a consistent look and feel, a standardized
menu and toolbars, keybindings, color-schemes, internationalization, and
a centralized, dialog-driven desktop configuration. More information on
KDE can be found at the KDE homepage. For FreeBSD-specific information,
consult the FreeBSD homepage at KDE.

8.2.1.1. Install KDE Plasma meta package

To install the KDE Plasma meta package with KDE Frameworks, Plasma
Desktop and Applications execute:

    # pkg install kde5

8.2.1.2. Minimal KDE Plasma installation

To install a minimal KDE Plasma execute:

    # pkg install plasma5-plasma

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | This installation is really       |
|                                   | minimal. Konsole must be          |
|                                   | installed separately executing:   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   |     # pkg install konsole         |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

8.2.1.3. Configure KDE Plasma

KDE Plasma uses dbus-daemon(1) for a message bus and hardware
abstraction. This application is automatically installed as a dependency
of KDE Plasma.

Enable D-BUS service in /etc/rc.conf to start at system boot:

    # sysrc dbus_enable="YES"

To increase messages size execute:

    sysctl net.local.stream.recvspace=65536
    sysctl net.local.stream.sendspace=65536

8.2.1.4. Start KDE Plasma

The preferred KDE Plasma display manager is x11/sddm. To install
x11/sddm, execute:

    # pkg install sddm

Enable SDDM service in /etc/rc.conf to start at system boot:

    # sysrc sddm_enable="YES"

The keyboard language can be set in SDDM by running the following
command (for Spanish, for example):

    # sysrc sddm_lang="es_ES"

A second method to start KDE Plasma is by manually invoking startx(1).
For this to work, the following line is needed in ~/.xinitrc:

    % echo "exec ck-launch-session startplasma-x11" > ~/.xinitrc

8.2.2. GNOME

GNOME is a user-friendly desktop environment. It includes a panel for
starting applications and displaying status, a desktop, a set of tools
and applications, and a set of conventions that make it easy for
applications to cooperate and be consistent with each other.

8.2.2.1. Install GNOME meta pacakge

To install the GNOME meta package with GNOME Desktop and Applications,
execute:

    # pkg install gnome

8.2.2.2. Minimal GNOME installation

To install the GNOME-lite meta package with a GNOME desktop slimmed down
for only the basics, execute:

    # pkg install gnome-lite

8.2.2.3. Configure GNOME

GNOME requires /proc to be mounted. Add this line to /etc/fstab to mount
this file system automatically during system startup:

    # Device                Mountpoint      FStype  Options         Dump    Pass#
    proc                    /proc           procfs  rw              0       0

GNOME uses dbus-daemon(1) for a message bus and hardware abstraction.
This application is automatically installed as a dependency of GNOME.

Enable D-BUS service in /etc/rc.conf to start at system boot:

    # sysrc dbus_enable="YES"

8.2.2.4. Start GNOME

GNOME Display Manager is the preferred display manager for GNOME. GDM is
installed as part of the GNOME package.

Enable GDM in /etc/rc.conf to start at system boot:

    # sysrc gdm_enable="YES"

A second method to start GNOME is by manually invoking startx(1). For
this to work, the following line is needed in ~/.xinitrc:

    % echo "exec gnome-session" > ~/.xinitrc

8.2.3. XFCE

XFCE is a desktop environment based on the GTK+, lightweight and
provides a simple, efficient, easy-to-use desktop. It is fully
configurable, has a main panel with menus, applets, and application
launchers, provides a file manager and sound manager, and is themeable.
Since it is fast, light, and efficient, it is ideal for older or slower
machines with memory limitations.

8.2.3.1. Install XFCE

To install the XFCE meta package, execute:

    # pkg install xfce

8.2.3.2. Configure XFCE

XFCE requires /proc to be mounted. Add this line to /etc/fstab to mount
this file system automatically during system startup:

    # Device                Mountpoint      FStype  Options         Dump    Pass#
    proc                    /proc           procfs  rw              0       0

XFCE uses dbus-daemon(1) for a message bus and hardware abstraction.
This application is automatically installed as a dependency of XFCE.

Enable D-BUS in /etc/rc.conf to start at system boot:

    # sysrc dbus_enable="YES"

8.2.3.3. Start XFCE

x11/lightdm is a display manager that supports different display
technologies and is a good choice as it is very lightweight, requires
little memory usage, and has fast performance.

To install it, execute:

    # pkg install lightdm lightdm-gtk-greeter

Enable lightdm in /etc/rc.conf to start at system boot:

    # sysrc lightdm_enable="YES"

A second method to start XFCE is by manually invoking startx(1). For
this to work, the following line is needed in ~/.xinitrc:

    % echo '. /usr/local/etc/xdg/xfce4/xinitrc' > ~/.xinitrc

8.2.4. MATE

The MATE Desktop Environment is the continuation of GNOME 2. It provides
an intuitive and attractive desktop environment using traditional
metaphors.

8.2.4.1. Install MATE meta package

To install the MATE meta package that includes the MATE Desktop with
some extra applications such as text editor, archiver manager, etc.,
execute:

    # pkg install mate

8.2.4.2. Minimal MATE installation

To install the MATE lite meta package with MATE desktop slimmed down for
only the basics, execute:

    # pkg install mate-base

8.2.4.3. Configure MATE

MATE requires /proc to be mounted. Add this line to /etc/fstab to mount
this file system automatically during system startup:

    # Device                Mountpoint      FStype  Options         Dump    Pass#
    proc                    /proc           procfs  rw              0       0

MATE uses dbus-daemon(1) for a message bus and hardware abstraction.
This application is automatically installed as a dependency of MATE.
Enable D-BUS in /etc/rc.conf to start at system boot:

    # sysrc dbus_enable="YES"

8.2.4.4. Start MATE

x11/lightdm is a display manager that supports different display
technologies and is a good choice as it is very lightweight, requires
