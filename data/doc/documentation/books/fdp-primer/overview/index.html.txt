-   1.2. Quick Start
-   1.3. The FreeBSD Documentation Set

Welcome to the FreeBSD Documentation Project (FDP). Quality
documentation is crucial to the success of FreeBSD, and we value your
contributions very highly.

This document describes how the FDP is organized, how to write and
submit documentation, and how to effectively use the available tools.

Everyone is welcome to contribute to the FDP. Willingness to contribute
is the only membership requirement.

This primer shows how to:

-   Understand the role of documentation and its place in the ecosystem.

-   Identify which parts of FreeBSD are maintained by the FDP.

-   Install the required documentation tools and files.

-   Make changes to the documentation.

-   Submit changes back for review and inclusion in the FreeBSD
    documentation.

1.1. Documentation in the FreeBSD Ecosystem

All documents are for the benefit of their readers, not their writers or
caretakers. They should adapt to the reader and not expect the reader to
adapt to them.

Never blame the reader for:

-   being unable to make use of a document easily or at all

-   finding a document confusing

-   not understanding a document or how to apply it

-   not finding an explicit answer or successfully bridging gaps (or
    connecting dots) to reason their way to one

Instead, acknowledge that the document is:

-   inaccessible

-   confusing

-   hard to understand or apply

-   incomplete

Then, make the document:

-   more accessible

-   less confusing

-   clearer

-   more complete

Use the following methods:

-   apply accessibility best practices to correct the problem reported
    and any similar ones you find

-   rework or clarify the confusing structure or language

-   add relevant examples to the part that is hard to understand or
    apply

-   fill in the gaps or add the missing stepping stones

1.2. Quick Start

Some preparatory steps must be taken before editing the FreeBSD
documentation. First, subscribe to the FreeBSD documentation project
mailing list. Some team members also interact on the #bsddocs IRC
channel on EFnet. These people can help with questions or problems
involving the documentation.

1.2.1. FreeBSD installation process

1.  Install these packages. The docproj meta-port installs all the
    applications required to do useful work with the FreeBSD
    documentation.

        # pkg install docproj

2.  Install a local working copy of the documentation from the FreeBSD
    repository in ~/doc (see The Working Copy).

        % git clone https://git.FreeBSD.org/doc.git ~/doc

3.  Edit the documentation files that require changes. If a file needs
    major changes, consult the mailing list for input.

    Review the output and edit the file to fix any problems shown, then
    rerun the command to find any remaining problems. Repeat until all
    of the errors are resolved.

4.  Always build and review the changes before submitting them. Running
    make in the documentation or website subdirectories will generate
    the documentation in HTML format.

        % make

    To reduce compile time, only one language can be compiled:

        % make DOC_LANG=en

    The build output is stored in ~/documentation/public/articles/ and
    ~/documentation/public/books/.

5.  Review the build output and ensure the edits are free from typos,
    layout problems, or errors. If any errors are found during the build
    process, edit the problematic files to fix any issues that show up,
    then run the build command again until all errors are resolved.

6.  Add all the files with git add ., then review the diff with
    git diff. For example:

        % git add .
        % git diff --staged

    Make sure that all required files are included, then commit the
    change to your local branch and generate a patch with
    git format-patch

        % git commit
        % git format-patch origin/main

    Patch generated with git format-patch will include author identity
    and email addresses, making it easier for developers to apply (with
    git am) and give proper credit.

    +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
    |                                   | To make it easier for committers  |
    |                                   | to apply the patch on their       |
    |                                   | working copy of the documentation |
    |                                   | tree, please generate the .diff   |
    |                                   | from the base of your             |
    |                                   | documentation tree.               |
    +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

    In the example above, changes have been made to the bsdinstall
    portion of the Handbook.

7.  Submit the patch or diff file using the web-based Problem Report
    system. If using the web form, enter a Summary of [patch] short
    description of problem. Select the Component Documentation. In the
    Description field, enter a short description of the changes and any
    important details about them. Use the Add an attachment button to
    attach the patch or diff file. Finally, use the Submit Bug button to
    submit your diff to the problem report system.

1.2.2. GNU/Linux installation process

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Hugo version 0.90 or higher must  |
|                                   | be used                           |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

1.  Install these packages in apt-based systems like Debian or Ubuntu.
    On other GNU/Linux distributions the package names may change.
    Consult your distributionâ€™s package manager if in doubt.

        # apt install hugo ruby-asciidoctor ruby-asciidoctor-pdf ruby-rouge git bmake

2.  Install a local working copy of the documentation from the FreeBSD
    repository in ~/doc (see The Working Copy).

        % git clone https://git.FreeBSD.org/doc.git ~/doc

3.  Edit the documentation files that require changes. If a file needs
    major changes, consult the mailing list for input.

    Review the output and edit the files to fix any problems shown, then
    rerun the command to find any remaining problems. Repeat until all
    of the errors are resolved.

4.  Always build and test the changes before submitting them. Running
    bmake in the documentation or website subdirectories will generate
    the documentation in HTML format.

        % bmake run LOCALBASE=/usr

5.  Add all the files with git add ., then review the diff with
    git diff. For example:

        % git add .
        % git diff --staged

    Make sure that all required files are included, then commit the
    change to your local branch and generate a patch with
    git format-patch

        % git commit
        % git format-patch origin/main

    Patch generated with git format-patch will include author identity
    and email addresses, making it easier for developers to apply (with
    git am) and give proper credit.

    +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

    |                                   | documentation tree.               |
    +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

6.  Submit the patch or diff file using the web-based Problem Report
    system. If using the web form, enter a Summary of short description
    of problem. Select the Component Documentation. In the Description
    field, enter a short description of the problem in the Summary field
    and add patch to the Keywords field. Use the Add an attachment
    button to attach the patch or diff file. Finally, use the Submit Bug
    button to submit your diff to the problem report system.

1.2.3. macOSÂ® installation process

1.3. The FreeBSD Documentation Set

The FDP is responsible for four categories of FreeBSD documentation.

-   Handbook: The Handbook is the comprehensive online resource and
    reference for FreeBSD users.

-   FAQ: The FAQ uses a short question and answer format to address
    questions that are frequently asked on the various mailing lists and
    forums devoted to FreeBSD. This format does not permit long and
    comprehensive answers.

-   Manual pages: The English language system manual pages are usually
    not written by the FDP, as they are part of the base system.
    However, the FDP can reword parts of existing manual pages to make
    them clearer or to correct inaccuracies.

-   Web site: This is the main FreeBSD presence on the web, visible at
    https://www.FreeBSD.org/ and many mirrors around the world. The web
    site is typically a new userâ€™s first exposure to FreeBSD.

Translation teams are responsible for translating the Handbook and web
site into different languages. Manual pages are not translated at
present.

Documentation source for the FreeBSD web site, Handbook, and FAQ is
available in the documentation repository at
https://cgit.freebsd.org/doc/.

Source for manual pages is available in a separate source repository
located at https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/.

Documentation commit messages are visible with git log. Commit messages
are also archived at Commit messages for all branches of the doc
repository.

Web frontends to both of these repositories are available at
https://cgit.freebsd.org/doc/ and https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/.

Many people have written tutorials or how-to articles about FreeBSD.
Some are stored as part of the FDP files. In other cases, the author has
decided to keep the documentation separate. The FDP endeavors to provide
links to as much of this external documentation as possible.
