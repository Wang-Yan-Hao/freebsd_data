13.1. Introduction

Here is a list of common dos and don’ts that are encountered during the
porting process. Check the port against this list, but also check ports
in the PR database that others have submitted. Submit any comments on
ports as described in Bug Reports and General Commentary. Checking ports
in the PR database will both make it faster for us to commit them, and
prove that you know what you are doing.

13.2. WRKDIR

Do not write anything to files outside WRKDIR. WRKDIR is the only place
that is guaranteed to be writable during the port build (see installing
ports from a CDROM for an example of building ports from a read-only
tree). The pkg-* files can be modified by redefining a variable rather
than overwriting the file.

13.3. WRKDIRPREFIX

Make sure the port honors WRKDIRPREFIX. Most ports do not have to worry
about this. In particular, when referring to a WRKDIR of another port,
note that the correct location is
${WRKDIRPREFIX}${PORTSDIR}/subdir/name/work not
${PORTSDIR}/subdir/name/work or ${.CURDIR}/../../subdir/name/work or
some such.

13.4. Differentiating Operating Systems and OS Versions

Some code needs modifications or conditional compilation based upon what
version of FreeBSD Unix it is running under. The preferred way to tell
FreeBSD versions apart are the __FreeBSD_version and __FreeBSD__ macros
defined in sys/param.h. If this file is not included add the code,

    #include <sys/param.h>

to the proper place in the .c file.

__FreeBSD__ is defined in all versions of FreeBSD as their major version
number. For example, in FreeBSD 9.x, __FreeBSD__ is defined to be 9.

    #if __FreeBSD__ >= 9
    #  if __FreeBSD_version >= 901000
         /* 9.1+ release specific code here */
    #  endif
    #endif

A complete list of __FreeBSD_version values is available in
__FreeBSD_version Values.

13.5. Writing Something After bsd.port.mk

Do not write anything after the .include <bsd.port.mk> line. It usually
can be avoided by including bsd.port.pre.mk somewhere in the middle of
the Makefile and bsd.port.post.mk at the end.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Include either the                |
|                                   | bsd.port.pre.mk/bsd.port.post.mk  |
|                                   | pair or bsd.port.mk only; do not  |
|                                   | mix these two usages.             |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

bsd.port.pre.mk only defines a few variables, which can be used in tests
in the Makefile, bsd.port.post.mk defines the rest.

Here are some important variables defined in bsd.port.pre.mk (this is
not the complete list, please read bsd.port.mk for the complete list).

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Variable                          | Description                       |
+===================================+===================================+
| ARCH                              | The architecture as returned by   |
|                                   | uname -m (for example, i386)      |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| OPSYS                             | The operating system type, as     |
|                                   | returned by uname -s (for         |
|                                   | example, FreeBSD)                 |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| OSREL                             | The release version of the        |
|                                   | operating system (for example,    |
|                                   | 2.1.5 or 2.2.7)                   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| OSVERSION                         | The numeric version of the        |
|                                   | operating system; the same as     |
|                                   | __FreeBSD_version.                |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| LOCALBASE                         | The base of the "local" tree (for |
|                                   | example, /usr/local)              |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| PREFIX                            | Where the port installs itself    |
|                                   | (see more on PREFIX).             |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | When MASTERDIR is needed, always  |
|                                   | define it before including        |
|                                   | bsd.port.pre.mk.                  |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Here are some examples of things that can be added after
bsd.port.pre.mk:

    # no need to compile lang/perl5 if perl5 is already in system
    .if ${OSVERSION} > 300003
    BROKEN= perl is in system
    .endif

Always use tab instead of spaces after BROKEN=.

13.6. Use the exec Statement in Wrapper Scripts

If the port installs a shell script whose purpose is to launch another
program, and if launching that program is the last action performed by
the script, make sure to launch the program using the exec statement,
for instance:

    #!/bin/sh
    exec %%LOCALBASE%%/bin/java -jar %%DATADIR%%/foo.jar "$@"

The exec statement replaces the shell process with the specified
program. If exec is omitted, the shell process remains in memory while
the program is executing, and needlessly consumes system resources.

13.7. Do Things Rationally

The Makefile should do things in a simple and reasonable manner. Making
it a couple of lines shorter or more readable is always better. Examples
include using a make .if construct instead of a shell if construct, not
redefining do-extract if redefining EXTRACT* is enough, and using
GNU_CONFIGURE instead of CONFIGURE_ARGS += --prefix=${PREFIX}.

If a lot of new code is needed to do something, there may already be an
implementation of it in bsd.port.mk. While hard to read, there are a
great many seemingly-hard problems for which bsd.port.mk already
provides a shorthand solution.

13.8. Respect Both CC and CXX

The port must respect both CC and CXX. What we mean by this is that the
port must not set the values of these variables absolutely, overriding
existing values; instead, it may append whatever values it needs to the
existing values. This is so that build options that affect all ports can
be set globally.

If the port does not respect these variables, please add
NO_PACKAGE=ignores either cc or cxx to the Makefile.

Here is an example of a Makefile respecting both CC and CXX. Note the
?=:

    CC?= gcc

    CXX?= g++

Here is an example which respects neither CC nor CXX:

    CC= gcc

    CXX= g++

Both CC and CXX can be defined on FreeBSD systems in /etc/make.conf. The
first example defines a value if it was not previously set in
/etc/make.conf, preserving any system-wide definitions. The second
example clobbers anything previously defined.

13.9. Respect CFLAGS

The port must respect CFLAGS. What we mean by this is that the port must
not set the value of this variable absolutely, overriding the existing
value. Instead, it may append whatever values it needs to the existing
value. This is so that build options that affect all ports can be set
globally.

If it does not, please add NO_PACKAGE=ignores cflags to the Makefile.

Here is an example of a Makefile respecting CFLAGS. Note the +=:

    CFLAGS+= -Wall -Werror

Here is an example which does not respect CFLAGS:

    CFLAGS= -Wall -Werror

CFLAGS is defined on FreeBSD systems in /etc/make.conf. The first
example appends additional flags to CFLAGS, preserving any system-wide
definitions. The second example clobbers anything previously defined.

Remove optimization flags from the third party Makefiles. The system
CFLAGS contains system-wide optimization flags. An example from an
unmodified Makefile:

    CFLAGS= -O3 -funroll-loops -DHAVE_SOUND

Using system optimization flags, the Makefile would look similar to this
example:

    CFLAGS+= -DHAVE_SOUND

13.10. Verbose Build Logs

Make the port build system display all commands executed during the
build stage. Complete build logs are crucial to debugging port problems.

Non-informative build log example (bad):

      CC     source1.o
      CC     source2.o
      CCLD   someprogram

Verbose build log example (good):

    cc -O2 -pipe -I/usr/local/include -c -o source1.o source1.c
    cc -O2 -pipe -I/usr/local/include -c -o source2.o source2.c
    cc -o someprogram source1.o source2.o -L/usr/local/lib -lsomelib

Some build systems such as CMake, ninja, and GNU configure are set up
for verbose logging by the ports framework. In other cases, ports might
need individual tweaks.

13.11. Feedback

Do send applicable changes and patches to the upstream maintainer for
inclusion in the next release of the code. This makes updating to the
next release that much easier.

13.12. README.html

README.html is not part of the port, but generated by make readme. Do
not include this file in patches or commits.

13.13. Marking a Port Not Installable with BROKEN, FORBIDDEN, or IGNORE

In certain cases, users must be prevented from installing a port. There
are several variables that can be used in a port’s Makefile to tell the
user that the port cannot be installed. The value of these make
variables will be the reason that is shown to users for why the port
refuses to install itself. Please use the correct make variable. Each
variable conveys radically different meanings, both to users and to
automated systems that depend on Makefiles, such as the ports build
cluster, and FreshPorts.

13.13.1. Variables

-   BROKEN is reserved for ports that currently do not compile, install,
    deinstall, or run correctly. Use it for ports where the problem is
    believed to be temporary.

    If instructed, the build cluster will still attempt to try to build
    them to see if the underlying problem has been resolved. (However,
    in general, the cluster is run without this.)

    For instance, use BROKEN when a port:

    -   does not compile

    -   fails its configuration or installation process

    -   installs files outside of ${PREFIX}

    -   does not remove all its files cleanly upon deinstall (however,
        it may be acceptable, and desirable, for the port to leave
        user-modified files behind)

    -   has runtime issues on systems where it is supposed to run fine.

-   FORBIDDEN is used for ports that contain a security vulnerability or
    induce grave concern regarding the security of a FreeBSD system with
    a given port installed (for example, a reputably insecure program or
    a program that provides easily exploitable services). Mark ports as
    FORBIDDEN as soon as a particular piece of software has a
    vulnerability and there is no released upgrade. Ideally upgrade
    ports as soon as possible when a security vulnerability is
    discovered so as to reduce the number of vulnerable FreeBSD hosts
    (we like being known for being secure), however sometimes there is a
    noticeable time gap between disclosure of a vulnerability and an
    updated release of the vulnerable software. Do not mark a port
    FORBIDDEN for any reason other than security.

-   IGNORE is reserved for ports that must not be built for some other
    reason. Use it for ports where the problem is believed to be
    structural. The build cluster will not, under any circumstances,
    build ports marked as IGNORE. For instance, use IGNORE when a port:

    -   does not work on the installed version of FreeBSD

    -   has a distfile which may not be automatically fetched due to
        licensing restrictions

    -   does not work with some other currently installed port (for
        instance, the port depends on www/drupal7 but www/drupal8 is
        installed)

        +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
        |                                   | If a port would conflict with a   |
        |                                   | currently installed port (for     |
        |                                   | example, if they install a file   |
        |                                   | in the same place that performs a |
        |                                   | different function), use          |
        |                                   | CONFLICTS instead. CONFLICTS will |
        |                                   | set IGNORE by itself.             |
        +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

13.13.2. Implementation Notes

Do not quote the values of BROKEN, IGNORE, and related variables. Due to
the way the information is shown to the user, the wording of messages
for each variable differ:

    BROKEN=    fails to link with base -lcrypto

    IGNORE=  unsupported on recent versions

resulting in this output from make describe:

    ===>  foobar-0.1 is marked as broken: fails to link with base -lcrypto.

    ===>  foobar-0.1 is unsupported on recent versions.

13.14. Architectural Considerations

13.14.1. General Notes on Architectures

FreeBSD runs on many more processor architectures than just the
well-known x86-based ones. Some ports have constraints which are
particular to one or more of these architectures.

For the list of supported architectures, run:

    cd ${SRCDIR}; make targets

The values are shown in the form TARGET/TARGET_ARCH. The ports read-only
makevar ARCH is set based on the value of TARGET_ARCH. Port Makefiles
should test the value of this Makevar.

13.14.2. Marking a Port as Architecture Neutral

Ports that do not have any architecture-dependent files or requirements
are identified by setting NO_ARCH=yes.

Packages built from such ports have their architecture string ending in
:* (wildcard architecture) as opposed to, for example, freebsd:13:x86:64
(amd64 architecture).

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | NO_ARCH is meant to indicate that |
|                                   | there is no need to build a       |
|                                   | package for each of the supported |
|                                   | architectures. The goal is to     |
|                                   | reduce the amount of resources    |
|                                   | spent on building and             |
|                                   | distributing the packages such as |
|                                   | network bandwidth and disk space  |
|                                   | on mirrors and on distribution    |
|                                   | media. Currently, however, our    |
|                                   | package infrastructure (e.g.,     |
|                                   | package managers, mirrors, and    |
|                                   | package builders) is not set up   |
|                                   | to fully benefit from NO_ARCH.    |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

13.14.3. Marking a Port as Ignored Only On Certain Architectures

-   To mark a port as IGNOREd only on certain architectures, there are
    two other convenience variables that will automatically set IGNORE:
    ONLY_FOR_ARCHS and NOT_FOR_ARCHS. Examples:

        ONLY_FOR_ARCHS= i386 amd64

        NOT_FOR_ARCHS= ia64 sparc64

    A custom IGNORE message can be set using ONLY_FOR_ARCHS_REASON and
    NOT_FOR_ARCHS_REASON. Per architecture entries are possible with
    ONLY_FOR_ARCHS_REASON_ARCH and NOT_FOR_ARCHS_REASON_ARCH.

-   If a port fetches i386 binaries and installs them, set
    IA32_BINARY_PORT. If this variable is set, /usr/lib32 must be
    present for IA32 versions of libraries and the kernel must support
    IA32 compatibility. If one of these two dependencies is not
    satisfied, IGNORE will be set automatically.

13.14.4. Cluster-Specific Considerations

-   Some ports attempt to tune themselves to the exact machine they are
    being built on by specifying -march=native to the compiler. This
    should be avoided: either list it under an off-by-default option, or
    delete it entirely.

    Otherwise, the default package produced by the build cluster might
    not run on every single machine of that ARCH.

13.15. Marking a Port for Removal with DEPRECATED or EXPIRATION_DATE

Do remember that BROKEN and FORBIDDEN are to be used as a temporary
resort if a port is not working. Permanently broken ports will be
removed from the tree entirely.

When it makes sense to do so, users can be warned about a pending port
removal with DEPRECATED and EXPIRATION_DATE. The former is a string
stating why the port is scheduled for removal; the latter is a string in
ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD). Both will be shown to the user.

It is possible to set DEPRECATED without an EXPIRATION_DATE (for
instance, recommending a newer version of the port), but the converse
does not make any sense.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | When marking a port as            |
|                                   | DEPRECATED, if there are any      |
|                                   | alternative ports that can be     |
|                                   | used as a replacement for the one |
|                                   | being deprecated, it is           |
|                                   | convenient to mention them in the |
|                                   | commit message.                   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

There is no set policy on how much notice to give. Current practice
seems to be one month for security-related issues and two months for
build issues. This also gives any interested committers a little time to
fix the problems.

13.16. Avoid Use of the .error Construct

The correct way for a Makefile to signal that the port cannot be
installed due to some external factor (for instance, the user has
specified an illegal combination of build options) is to set a non-blank
value to IGNORE. This value will be formatted and shown to the user by
make install.

It is a common mistake to use .error for this purpose. The problem with
this is that many automated tools that work with the ports tree will
fail in this situation. The most common occurrence of this is seen when
trying to build /usr/ports/INDEX (see Running make describe). However,
even more trivial commands such as make maintainer also fail in this
scenario. This is not acceptable.

Example 1. How to Avoid Using .error

The first of the next two Makefile snippets will cause make index to
fail, while the second one will not:

    .error "option is not supported"

    IGNORE=option is not supported

13.17. Usage of sysctl

The usage of sysctl is discouraged except in targets. This is because
the evaluation of any makevars, such as used during make index, then has
to run the command, further slowing down that process.

Only use sysctl(8) through SYSCTL, as it contains the fully qualified
path and can be overridden, if one has such a special need.

13.18. Rerolling Distfiles

Sometimes the authors of software change the content of released
distfiles without changing the file’s name. Verify that the changes are
official and have been performed by the author. It has happened in the
past that the distfile was silently altered on the download servers with
the intent to cause harm or compromise end user security.

Put the old distfile aside, download the new one, unpack them and
compare the content with diff(1). If there is nothing suspicious, update
distinfo.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Be sure to summarize the          |
|                                   | differences in the PR and commit  |
|                                   | log, so that other people know    |
|                                   | that nothing bad has happened.    |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Contact the authors of the software and confirm the changes with them.

13.19. Use POSIX Standards

FreeBSD ports generally expect POSIX compliance. Some software and build
systems make assumptions based on a particular operating system or
environment that can cause problems when used in a port.

Do not use /proc if there are any other ways of getting the information.
For example, setprogname(argv[0]) in main() and then getprogname(3) to
know the executable name.

Do not rely on behavior that is undocumented by POSIX.

Do not record timestamps in the critical path of the application if it
also works without. Getting timestamps may be slow, depending on the
accuracy of timestamps in the OS. If timestamps are really needed,
determine how precise they have to be and use an API which is documented
to just deliver the needed precision.

A number of simple syscalls (for example gettimeofday(2), getpid(2)) are
much faster on Linux® than on any other operating system due to caching
and the vsyscall performance optimizations. Do not rely on them being
cheap in performance-critical applications. In general, try hard to
avoid syscalls if possible.

Do not rely on Linux®-specific socket behavior. In particular, default
socket buffer sizes are different (call setsockopt(2) with SO_SNDBUF and
SO_RCVBUF, and while Linux®'s send(2) blocks when the socket buffer is
full, FreeBSD’s will fail and set ENOBUFS in errno.

If relying on non-standard behavior is required, encapsulate it properly
into a generic API, do a check for the behavior in the configure stage,
and stop if it is missing.

Check the man pages to see if the function used is a POSIX interface (in
the "STANDARDS" section of the man page).

Do not assume that /bin/sh is bash. Ensure that a command line passed to
system(3) will work with a POSIX compliant shell.

A list of common bashisms is available here.

Check that headers are included in the POSIX or man page recommended
way. For example, sys/types.h is often forgotten, which is not as much
of a problem for Linux® as it is for FreeBSD.

13.20. Miscellanea

Always double-check pkg-descr and pkg-plist. If reviewing a port and a
better wording can be achieved, do so.

Please be careful to note any legal issues! Do not let us illegally
distribute software!
