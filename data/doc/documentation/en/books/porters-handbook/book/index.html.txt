Chapter 1. Introduction

The FreeBSD Ports Collection is the way almost everyone installs
applications ("ports") on FreeBSD. Like everything else about FreeBSD,
it is primarily a volunteer effort. It is important to keep this in mind
when reading this document.

In FreeBSD, anyone may submit a new port, or volunteer to maintain an
existing unmaintained port. No special commit privilege is needed.

Chapter 2. Making a New Port

Interested in making a new port, or upgrading existing ports? Great!

What follows are some guidelines for creating a new port for FreeBSD. To
upgrade an existing port, read this, then read Upgrading a Port.

When this document is not sufficiently detailed, refer to
/usr/ports/Mk/bsd.port.mk, which is included by all port Makefiles. Even
those not hacking Makefiles daily can gain much knowledge from it.
Additionally, specific questions can be sent to the FreeBSD ports
mailing list.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Only a fraction of the variables  |
|                                   | (VAR) that can be overridden are  |
|                                   | mentioned in this document. Most  |
|                                   | (if not all) are documented at    |
|                                   | the start of                      |
|                                   | /usr/ports/Mk/bsd.port.mk; the    |
|                                   | others probably ought to be. Note |
|                                   | that this file uses a             |
|                                   | non-standard tab setting: Emacs   |
|                                   | and Vim will recognize the        |
|                                   | setting on loading the file. Both |
|                                   | vi(1) and ex(1) can be set to use |
|                                   | the correct value by typing       |
|                                   | :set tabstop=4 once the file has  |
|                                   | been loaded.                      |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Looking for something easy to start with? Take a look at the list of
requested ports and see if you can work on one (or more).

Chapter 3. Quick Porting

This section describes how to quickly create a new port. For
applications where this quick method is not adequate, the full "Slow
Porting" process is described in Slow Porting.

First, get the original tarball and put it into DISTDIR, which defaults
to /usr/ports/distfiles.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | These steps assume that the       |
|                                   | software compiled out-of-the-box. |
|                                   | In other words, absolutely no     |
|                                   | changes were required for the     |
|                                   | application to work on a FreeBSD  |
|                                   | system. If anything had to be     |
|                                   | changed, refer to Slow Porting.   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | It is recommended to set the      |
|                                   | DEVELOPER make(1) variable in     |
|                                   | /etc/make.conf before getting     |
|                                   | into porting.                     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   |     # ech                         |
|                                   | o DEVELOPER=yes >> /etc/make.conf |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This setting enables the          |
|                                   | "developer mode" that displays    |
|                                   | deprecation warnings and          |
|                                   | activates some further quality    |
|                                   | checks on calling make.           |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

3.1. Writing the Makefile

The minimal Makefile would look something like this:

    PORTNAME=    oneko
    DISTVERSION=    1.1b
    CATEGORIES= games
    MASTER_SITES=   ftp://ftp.rediris.es/sites/ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/

    MAINTAINER= youremail@example.com
    COMMENT=    Cat chasing a mouse all over the screen
    WWW=        http://www.daidouji.com/oneko/

    .include <bsd.port.mk>

Try to figure it out. A more detailed example is shown in the sample
Makefile section.

3.2. Writing the Description Files

There are two description files that are required for any port, whether
they actually package or not. They are pkg-descr and pkg-plist. Their
pkg- prefix distinguishes them from other files.

3.2.1. pkg-descr

This is a longer description of the port. One to a few paragraphs
concisely explaining what the port does is sufficient.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | This is not a manual or an        |
|                                   | in-depth description on how to    |
|                                   | use or compile the port! Please   |
|                                   | be careful when copying from the  |
|                                   | README or manpage. Too often they |
|                                   | are not a concise description of  |
|                                   | the port or are in an awkward     |
|                                   | format. For example, manpages     |
|                                   | have justified spacing, which     |
|                                   | looks particularly bad with       |
|                                   | monospaced fonts.                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | On the other hand, the content of |
|                                   | pkg-descr must be longer than the |
|                                   | COMMENT line from the Makefile.   |
|                                   | It must explain in more depth     |
|                                   | what the port is all about.       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

A well-written pkg-descr describes the port completely enough that users
would not have to consult the documentation or visit the website to
understand what the software does, how it can be useful, or what
particularly nice features it has. Mentioning certain requirements like
a graphical toolkit, heavy dependencies, runtime environment, or
implementation languages help users decide whether this port will work
for them.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | The URL that used to be included  |
|                                   | as the last line of the pkg-descr |
|                                   | file has been moved to the        |
|                                   | Makefile.                         |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

3.2.2. pkg-plist

This file lists all the files installed by the port. It is also called
the "packing list" because the package is generated by packing the files
listed here. The pathnames are relative to the installation prefix
(usually /usr/local).

Here is a small example:

    bin/oneko
    man/man1/oneko.1.gz
    lib/X11/app-defaults/Oneko
    lib/X11/oneko/cat1.xpm
    lib/X11/oneko/cat2.xpm
    lib/X11/oneko/mouse.xpm

Refer to the pkg-create(8) manual page for details on the packing list.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | It is recommended to keep all the |
|                                   | filenames in this file sorted     |
|                                   | alphabetically. It will make      |
|                                   | verifying changes when upgrading  |
|                                   | the port much easier.             |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Creating a packing list manually  |
|                                   | can be a very tedious task. If    |
|                                   | the port installs a large numbers |
|                                   | of files, creating the packing    |
|                                   | list automatically might save     |
|                                   | time.                             |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

There is only one case when pkg-plist can be omitted from a port. If the
port installs just a handful of files, list them in PLIST_FILES, within
the port’s Makefile. For instance, we could get along without pkg-plist
in the above oneko port by adding these lines to the Makefile:

    PLIST_FILES=    bin/oneko \
            man/man1/oneko.1.gz \
            lib/X11/app-defaults/Oneko \
            lib/X11/oneko/cat1.xpm \
            lib/X11/oneko/cat2.xpm \
            lib/X11/oneko/mouse.xpm

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Usage of PLIST_FILES should not   |
|                                   | be abused. When looking for the   |
|                                   | origin of a file, people usually  |
|                                   | try to grep through the pkg-plist |
|                                   | files in the ports tree. Listing  |
|                                   | files in PLIST_FILES in the       |
|                                   | Makefile makes that search more   |
|                                   | difficult.                        |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | If a port needs to create an      |
|                                   | empty directory, or creates       |
|                                   | directories outside of ${PREFIX}  |
|                                   | during installation, refer to     |

|                                   | more information.                 |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | As PLIST_FILES is a make(1)       |
|                                   | variable, any entry with spaces   |
|                                   | must be quoted. For example, if   |
|                                   | using keywords described in       |
|                                   | pkg-create(8) and Expanding       |
|                                   | Package List with Keywords, the   |
|                                   | entry must be quoted.             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   |     PLIST_FILES= "@sa             |
|                                   | mple ${ETCDIR}/oneko.conf.sample" |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Later we will see how pkg-plist and PLIST_FILES can be used to fulfill
more sophisticated tasks.

3.3. Creating the Checksum File

Just type make makesum. The ports framework will automatically generate
distinfo. Do not try to generate the file manually.

3.4. Testing the Port

Make sure that the port rules do exactly what is desired, including
packaging up the port. These are the important points to verify:

-   pkg-plist does not contain anything not installed by the port.

-   pkg-plist contains everything that is installed by the port.

-   The port can be installed using the install target. This verifies
    that the install script works correctly.

-   The port can be deinstalled properly using the deinstall target.
    This verifies that the deinstall script works correctly.

-   The port only has access to network resources during the fetch
    target phase. This is important for package builders, such as
    ports-mgmt/poudriere.

-   Make sure that make package can be run as a normal user (that is,
    not as root). If that fails, the software may need to be patched.
    See also fakeroot and uidfix.

Procedure: Recommended Test Ordering

1.  make stage

2.  make stage-qa

3.  make package

4.  make install

5.  make deinstall

6.  make package (as user)

Make certain no warnings are shown in any of the stages.

Thorough automated testing can be done with ports-mgmt/poudriere from
the Ports Collection, see Poudriere for more information. It maintains
jails where all of the steps shown above can be tested without affecting
the state of the host system.

3.5. Checking the Port with portlint

Please use portlint to see if the port conforms to our guidelines. The
ports-mgmt/portlint program is part of the ports collection. In
particular, check that the Makefile is in the right shape and the
package is named appropriately.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Do not blindly follow the output  |
|                                   | of portlint. It is a static lint  |
|                                   | tool and sometimes gets things    |
|                                   | wrong.                            |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

3.6. Submitting the New Port

Before submitting the new port, read the DOs and DON’Ts section.

Once happy with the port, the only thing remaining is to put it in the
main FreeBSD ports tree and make everybody else happy about it too.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | We do not need the work directory |
|                                   | or the pkgname.txz package, so    |
|                                   | delete them now.                  |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Next, create a patch(1), file. Assuming the port is called oneko and is
in the games category.

Example 1. Creating a .diff for a New Port

Add all the files with git add ., then review the diff with git diff.
For example:

    % git add .
    % git diff --staged

Make sure that all required files are included, then commit the change
to your local branch and generate a patch with git format-patch

    % git commit
    % git format-patch origin/main

Patch generated with git format-patch will include author identity and
email addresses, making it easier for developers to apply (with git am)
and give proper credit.

To make it easier for committers to apply the patch on their working
copy of the ports tree, please generate the .diff from the base of your
ports tree.

Submit oneko.diff with the bug submission form. Use product "Ports &
Packages", component "Individual Port(s)", and follow the guidelines
shown there. Add a short description of the program to the Description
field of the PR (perhaps a short version of COMMENT), and remember to
add oneko.diff as an attachment.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Giving a good description in the  |
|                                   | summary of the problem report     |
|                                   | makes the work of port committers |
|                                   | and triagers a lot easier. The    |
|                                   | expected format for new ports is  |
|                                   | "[NEW PORT] category/portname     |
|                                   | short description of the port".   |
|                                   | Using this scheme makes it easier |
|                                   | and faster to begin the work of   |
|                                   | committing the new port.          |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

After submitting the port, please be patient. The time needed to include
a new port in FreeBSD can vary from a few days to a few months. A simple
search form of the Problem Report database can be searched at
https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/query.cgi.

To get a listing of open port PRs, select Open and Ports & Packages in
the search form, then click Search.

After looking at the new port, we will reply if necessary, and commit it
to the tree. The submitter’s name will also be added to the list of
Additional FreeBSD Contributors and other files.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Previously it was possible to     |
|                                   | submit patches for new ports      |
|                                   | using a shar(1) file; this is no  |
|                                   | longer the case with the          |
|                                   | evolution of git(1). Committers   |
|                                   | no longer accept shar(1) files as |
|                                   | their use is prone to mistake and |
|                                   | does not add the relevant entry   |
|                                   | in the category’s Makefile.       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Chapter 4. Slow Porting

Okay, so it was not that simple, and the port required some
modifications to get it to work. In this section, we will explain, step
by step, how to modify it to get it to work with the ports paradigm.

4.1. How Things Work

First, this is the sequence of events which occurs when the user first
types make in the port’s directory. Having bsd.port.mk in another window
while reading this really helps to understand it.

But do not worry, not many people understand exactly how bsd.port.mk is
working…​ :-)

1.  The fetch target is run. The fetch target is responsible for making
    sure that the tarball exists locally in DISTDIR. If fetch cannot
    find the required files in DISTDIR it will look up the URL
    MASTER_SITES, which is set in the Makefile, as well as our FTP
    mirrors where we put distfiles as backup. It will then attempt to
    fetch the named distribution file with FETCH, assuming that the
    requesting site has direct access to the Internet. If that succeeds,
    it will save the file in DISTDIR for future use and proceed.

2.  The extract target is run. It looks for the port’s distribution file
    (typically a compressed tarball) in DISTDIR and unpacks it into a
    temporary subdirectory specified by WRKDIR (defaults to work).

3.  The patch target is run. First, any patches defined in PATCHFILES
    are applied. Second, if any patch files named patch-* are found in
    PATCHDIR (defaults to the files subdirectory), they are applied at
    this time in alphabetical order.

4.  The configure target is run. This can do any one of many different
    things.

    a.  If it exists, scripts/configure is run.

    b.  If HAS_CONFIGURE or GNU_CONFIGURE is set, WRKSRC/configure is
        run.

5.  The build target is run. This is responsible for descending into the
    port’s private working directory (WRKSRC) and building it.

6.  The stage target is run. This puts the final set of built files into
    a temporary directory (STAGEDIR, see Staging). The hierarchy of this
    directory mirrors that of the system on which the package will be
    installed.

7.  The package target is run. This creates a package using the files
    from the temporary directory created during the stage target and the
    port’s pkg-plist.

8.  The install target is run. This installs the package created during
    the package target into the host system.

The above are the default actions. In addition, define targets
pre-something or post-something, or put scripts with those names, in the
scripts subdirectory, and they will be run before or after the default
actions are done.

For example, if there is a post-extract target defined in the Makefile,
and a file pre-build in the scripts subdirectory, the post-extract
target will be called after the regular extraction actions, and
pre-build will be executed before the default build rules are done. It
is recommended to use Makefile targets if the actions are simple enough,
because it will be easier for someone to figure out what kind of
non-default action the port requires.

The default actions are done by the do-something targets from
bsd.port.mk. For example, the commands to extract a port are in the
target do-extract. If the default target does not do the job right,
redefine the do-something target in the Makefile.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | The "main" targets (for example,  |
|                                   | extract, configure, etc.) do      |
|                                   | nothing more than make sure all   |
|                                   | the stages up to that one are     |
|                                   | completed and call the real       |
|                                   | targets or scripts, and they are  |
|                                   | not intended to be changed. To    |
|                                   | fix the extraction, fix           |
|                                   | do-extract, but never ever change |
|                                   | the way extract operates!         |
|                                   | Additionally, the target          |
|                                   | post-deinstall is invalid and is  |
|                                   | not run by the ports              |
|                                   | infrastructure.                   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Now that what goes on when the user types make install is better
understood, let us go through the recommended steps to create the
perfect port.

4.2. Getting the Original Sources

Get the original sources (normally) as a compressed tarball (foo.tar.gz
or foo.tar.bz2) and copy it into DISTDIR. Always use mainstream sources
when and where possible.

Set the variable MASTER_SITES to reflect where the original tarball
resides. Shorthand definitions exist for most mainstream sites in
bsd.sites.mk. Please use these sites-and the associated definitions-if
at all possible, to help avoid the problem of having the same
information repeated over again many times in the source base. As these
sites tend to change over time, this becomes a maintenance nightmare for
everyone involved. See MASTER_SITES for details.

If there is no FTP/HTTP site that is well-connected to the net, or can
only find sites that have irritatingly non-standard formats, put a copy
on a reliable FTP or HTTP server (for example, a home page).

If a convenient and reliable place to put the distfile cannot be found,
we can "house" it ourselves on ftp.FreeBSD.org; however, this is the
least-preferred solution. The distfile must be placed into
~/public_distfiles/ of someone’s freefall account. Ask the person who
commits the port to do this. This person will also set MASTER_SITES to
LOCAL/username where username is their FreeBSD cluster login.

If the port’s distfile changes all the time without any kind of version
update by the author, consider putting the distfile on a home page and
listing it as the first MASTER_SITES. Try to talk the port author out of
doing this; it really does help to establish some kind of source code
control. Hosting a specific version will prevent users from getting
checksum mismatch errors, and also reduce the workload of maintainers of
our FTP site. Also, if there is only one master site for the port, it is
recommended to house a backup on a home page and list it as the second
MASTER_SITES.

If the port requires additional patches that are available on the
Internet, fetch them too and put them in DISTDIR. Do not worry if they
come from a site other than where the main source tarball comes, we have
a way to handle these situations (see the description of PATCHFILES
below).

4.3. Modifying the Port

Unpack a copy of the tarball in a private directory and make whatever
changes are necessary to get the port to compile properly under the
current version of FreeBSD. Keep careful track of steps, as they will be
needed to automate the process shortly. Everything, including the
deletion, addition, or modification of files has to be doable using an
automated script or patch file when the port is finished.

If the port requires significant user interaction/customization to
compile or install, take a look at one of Larry Wall’s classic Configure
scripts and perhaps do something similar. The goal of the new ports
collection is to make each port as "plug-and-play" as possible for the
end-user while using a minimum of disk space.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Unless explicitly stated, patch   |
|                                   | files, scripts, and other files   |
|                                   | created and contributed to the    |
|                                   | FreeBSD ports collection are      |
|                                   | assumed to be covered by the      |
|                                   | standard BSD copyright            |
|                                   | conditions.                       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

4.4. Patching

In the preparation of the port, files that have been added or changed
can be recorded with diff(1) for later feeding to patch(1). Doing this
with a typical file involves saving a copy of the original file before
making any changes using a .orig suffix.

    % cp file file.orig

After all changes have been made, cd back to the port directory. Use
make makepatch to generate updated patch files in the files directory.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

4.4.1. General Rules for Patching

Patch files are stored in PATCHDIR, usually files/, from where they will
be automatically applied. All patches must be relative to WRKSRC.
Typically WRKSRC is a subdirectory of WRKDIR, the directory where the
distfile is extracted. Use make -V WRKSRC to see the actual path. The
patch names are to follow these rules:

-   Avoid having more than one patch modify the same file. For example,
    having both patch-foobar.c and patch-foobar.c2 making changes to
    ${WRKSRC}/foobar.c makes them fragile and difficult to debug.

-   When creating names for patch files, replace each underscore (_)
    with two underscores (__) and each slash (/) with one underscore
    (_). For example, to patch a file named src/freeglut_joystick.c,
    name the corresponding patch patch-src_freeglut__joystick.c. Do not
    name patches like patch-aa or patch-ab. Always use the path and file
    name in patch names. Using make makepatch automatically generates
    the correct names.

-   A patch may modify multiple files if the changes are related and the
    patch is named appropriately. For example,
    patch-add-missing-stdlib.h.

-   Only use characters [-+._a-zA-Z0-9] for naming patches. In
    particular, do not use :: as a path separator, use _ instead.

Minimize the amount of non-functional whitespace changes in patches. It
is common in the Open Source world for projects to share large amounts
of a code base, but obey different style and indenting rules. When
taking a working piece of functionality from one project to fix similar
areas in another, please be careful: the resulting patch may be full of
non-functional changes. It not only increases the size of the ports
repository but makes it hard to find out what exactly caused the problem
and what was changed at all.

If a file must be deleted, do it in the post-extract target rather than
as part of the patch.

4.4.2. Manual Patch Generation

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Manual patch creation is usually  |
|                                   | not necessary. Automatic patch    |
|                                   | generation as described earlier   |
|                                   | in this section is the preferred  |
|                                   | method. However, manual patching  |
|                                   | may be required occasionally.     |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Patches are saved into files named patch-* where * indicates the
pathname of the file that is patched, such as patch-Imakefile or
patch-src-config.h. Patches with file names which do not start with
patch- will not be applied automatically.

After the file has been modified, diff(1) is used to record the
differences between the original and the modified version. -u causes
diff(1) to produce "unified" diffs, the preferred form.

    % diff -u file.orig file > patch-pathname-file

When generating patches for new, added files, -N is used to tell diff(1)
to treat the non-existent original file as if it existed but was empty:

    % diff -u -N newfile.orig newfile > patch-pathname-newfile

Using the recurse (-r) option to diff(1) to generate patches is fine,
but please look at the resulting patches to make sure there is no
unnecessary junk in there. In particular, diffs between two backup
files, Makefiles when the port uses Imake or GNU configure, etc., are
unnecessary and have to be deleted. If it was necessary to edit
configure.in and run autoconf to regenerate configure, do not take the
diffs of configure (it often grows to a few thousand lines!). Instead,
define USES=autoreconf and take the diffs of configure.in.

4.4.3. Simple Automatic Replacements

Simple replacements can be performed directly from the port Makefile
using the in-place mode of sed(1). This is useful when changes use the
value of a variable:

    post-patch:
        @${REINPLACE_CMD} -e 's|/usr/local|${PREFIX}|g' ${WRKSRC}/Makefile

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Only use sed(1) to replace        |
|                                   | variable content. You must use    |
|                                   | patch files instead of sed(1) to  |
|                                   | replace static content.           |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Quite often, software being ported uses the CR/LF convention in source
files. This may cause problems with further patching, compiler warnings,
or script execution (like /bin/sh^M not found.) To quickly convert all
files from CR/LF to just LF, add this entry to the port Makefile:

    USES=    dos2unix

A list of specific files to convert can be given:

    USES= dos2unix
    DOS2UNIX_FILES= util.c util.h

Use DOS2UNIX_REGEX to convert a group of files across subdirectories.
Its argument is a find(1)-compatible regular expression. More on the
format is in re_format(7). This option is useful for converting all
files of a given extension. For example, convert all source code files,
leaving binary files intact:

    USES=    dos2unix
    DOS2UNIX_REGEX= .*\.([ch]|cpp)

A similar option is DOS2UNIX_GLOB, which runs find for each element
listed in it.

    USES= dos2unix
    DOS2UNIX_GLOB=  *.c *.cpp *.h

The base directory for the conversion can be set. This is useful when
there are multiple distfiles and several contain files which require
line-ending conversion.

    USES=    dos2unix
    DOS2UNIX_WRKSRC=    ${WRKDIR}

4.4.4. Patching Conditionally

Some ports need patches that are only applied for specific FreeBSD
versions or when a particular option is enabled or disabled. Conditional
patches are specified by placing the full paths to the patch files in
EXTRA_PATCHES. Conditional patch file names usually start with extra-
although this is not necessary. However, their file names must not start
with patch-. If they do, they are applied unconditionally by the
framework which is undesired for conditional patches.

Example 2. Applying a Patch for a Specific FreeBSD Version

    .include <bsd.port.options.mk>

    # Patch in the iconv const qualifier before this
    .if ${OPSYS} == FreeBSD && ${OSVERSION} < 1100069
    EXTRA_PATCHES=  ${PATCHDIR}/extra-patch-fbsd10
    .endif

    .include <bsd.port.mk>

Example 3. Optionally Applying a Patch

When an option requires a patch, use opt_EXTRA_PATCHES and
opt_EXTRA_PATCHES_OFF to make the patch conditional on the opt option.
See Generic Variables Replacement for more information.

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=    FOO BAR
    FOO_EXTRA_PATCHES=  ${PATCHDIR}/extra-patch-foo
    BAR_EXTRA_PATCHES_OFF=  ${PATCHDIR}/extra-patch-bar.c \
            ${PATCHDIR}/extra-patch-bar.h

Example 4. Using EXTRA_PATCHES With a Directory

Sometimes, there are many patches that are needed for a feature, in this
case, it is possible to point EXTRA_PATCHES to a directory, and it will
automatically apply all files named patch-* in it.

Create a subdirectory in ${PATCHDIR}, and move the patches in it. For
example:

    % ls -l files/foo-patches
    -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel    350 Jan 16 01:27 patch-Makefile.in
    -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel   3084 Jan 18 15:37 patch-configure

Then add this to the Makefile:

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=    FOO
    FOO_EXTRA_PATCHES=  ${PATCHDIR}/foo-patches

The framework will then use all the files named patch-* in that
directory.

4.5. Configuring

Include any additional customization commands in the configure script
and save it in the scripts subdirectory. As mentioned above, it is also
possible do this with Makefile targets and/or scripts with the name
pre-configure or post-configure.

4.6. Handling User Input

If the port requires user input to build, configure, or install, set
IS_INTERACTIVE in the Makefile. This will allow "overnight builds" to
skip it. If the user sets the variable BATCH in their environment (and
if the user sets the variable INTERACTIVE, then only those ports
requiring interaction are built). This will save a lot of wasted time on
the set of machines that continually build ports (see below).

It is also recommended that if there are reasonable default answers to
the questions, PACKAGE_BUILDING be used to turn off the interactive
script when it is set. This will allow us to build the packages for
CDROMs and FTP.

Chapter 5. Configuring the Makefile

Configuring the Makefile is pretty simple, and again we suggest looking
at existing examples before starting. Also, there is a sample Makefile
in this handbook, so take a look and please follow the ordering of
variables and sections in that template to make the port easier for
others to read.

Consider these problems in sequence during the design of the new
Makefile:

5.1. The Original Source

Does it live in DISTDIR as a standard gzipped tarball named something
like foozolix-1.2.tar.gz? If so, go on to the next step. If not, the
distribution file format might require overriding one or more of
DISTVERSION, DISTNAME, EXTRACT_CMD, EXTRACT_BEFORE_ARGS,
EXTRACT_AFTER_ARGS, EXTRACT_SUFX, or DISTFILES.

In the worst case, create a custom do-extract target to override the
default. This is rarely, if ever, necessary.

5.2. Naming

The first part of the port’s Makefile names the port, describes its
version number, and lists it in the correct category.

5.2.1. PORTNAME

Set PORTNAME to the base name of the software. It is used as the base
for the FreeBSD package, and for DISTNAME.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | The package name must be unique   |
|                                   | across the entire ports tree.     |
|                                   | Make sure that the PORTNAME is    |
|                                   | not already in use by an existing |
|                                   | port, and that no other port      |
|                                   | already has the same PKGBASE. If  |
|                                   | the name has already been used,   |
|                                   | add either PKGNAMEPREFIX or       |
|                                   | PKGNAMESUFFIX.                    |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

5.2.2. Versions, DISTVERSION or PORTVERSION

Set DISTVERSION to the version number of the software.

PORTVERSION is the version used for the FreeBSD package. It will be
automatically derived from DISTVERSION to be compatible with FreeBSD’s
package versioning scheme. If the version contains letters, it might be
needed to set PORTVERSION and not DISTVERSION.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Only one of PORTVERSION and       |
|                                   | DISTVERSION can be set at a time. |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

From time to time, some software will use a version scheme that is not
compatible with how DISTVERSION translates in PORTVERSION.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | When updating a port, it is       |
|                                   | possible to use pkg-version(8)'s  |
|                                   | -t argument to check if the new   |
|                                   | version is greater or lesser than |
|                                   | before. See Using pkg-version(8)  |
|                                   | to Compare Versions.              |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Example 5. Using pkg-version(8) to Compare Versions

pkg version -t takes two versions as arguments, it will respond with <,
= or > if the first version is less, equal, or more than the second
version, respectively.

    % pkg version -t 1.2 1.3
    < (1)
    % pkg version -t 1.2 1.2
    = (2)
    % pkg version -t 1.2 1.2.0
    = (3)
    % pkg version -t 1.2 1.2.p1
    > (4)
    % pkg version -t 1.2.a1 1.2.b1
    < (5)
    % pkg version -t 1.2 1.2p1
    < (6)

  --- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1   1.2 is before 1.3.
  2   1.2 and 1.2 are equal as they have the same version.
  3   1.2 and 1.2.0 are equal as nothing equals zero.
  4   1.2 is after 1.2.p1 as .p1, think "pre-release 1".
  5   1.2.a1 is before 1.2.b1, think "alpha" and "beta", and a is before b.
  6   1.2 is before 1.2p1 as 2p1, think "2, patch level 1" which is a version after any 2.X but before 3.
  --- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In here, the a, b, and p are used as if meaning "alpha", "beta" or
"pre-release" and "patch level", but they are only letters and are
sorted alphabetically, so any letter can be used, and they will be
sorted appropriately.

: Table 1. Examples of DISTVERSION and the Derived PORTVERSION

Example 6. Using DISTVERSION

When the version only contains numbers separated by dots, dashes or
underscores, use DISTVERSION.

    PORTNAME=   nekoto
    DISTVERSION=    1.2-4

It will generate a PORTVERSION of 1.2.4.

Example 7. Using DISTVERSION When the Version Starts with a Letter or a
Prefix

When the version starts or ends with a letter, or a prefix or a suffix
that is not part of the version, use DISTVERSIONPREFIX, DISTVERSION, and
DISTVERSIONSUFFIX.

If the version is v1.2-4:

    PORTNAME=   nekoto
    DISTVERSIONPREFIX=  v
    DISTVERSION=    1_2_4

Some of the time, projects using GitHub will use their name in their
versions. For example, the version could be nekoto-1.2-4:

    PORTNAME=   nekoto
    DISTVERSIONPREFIX=  nekoto-
    DISTVERSION=    1.2_4

Those projects also sometimes use some string at the end of the version,
for example, 1.2-4_RELEASE:

    PORTNAME=   nekoto
    DISTVERSION=    1.2-4
    DISTVERSIONSUFFIX=  _RELEASE

Or they do both, for example, nekoto-1.2-4_RELEASE:

    PORTNAME=   nekoto
    DISTVERSIONPREFIX=  nekoto-
    DISTVERSION=    1.2-4
    DISTVERSIONSUFFIX=  _RELEASE

DISTVERSIONPREFIX and DISTVERSIONSUFFIX will not be used while
constructing PORTVERSION, but only used in DISTNAME.

All will generate a PORTVERSION of 1.2.4.

Example 8. Using DISTVERSION When the Version Contains Letters Meaning
"alpha", "beta", or "pre-release"

When the version contains numbers separated by dots, dashes or
underscores, and letters are used to mean "alpha", "beta" or
"pre-release", which is, before the version without the letters, use
DISTVERSION.

    PORTNAME=   nekoto
    DISTVERSION=    1.2-pre4

    PORTNAME=   nekoto
    DISTVERSION=    1.2p4

Both will generate a PORTVERSION of 1.2.p4 which is before than 1.2.
pkg-version(8) can be used to check that fact:

    % pkg version -t 1.2.p4 1.2
    <

Example 9. Not Using DISTVERSION When the Version Contains Letters
Meaning "Patch Level"

When the version contains letters that are not meant as "alpha", "beta",
or "pre", but more in a "patch level", and meaning after the version
without the letters, use PORTVERSION.

    PORTNAME=   nekoto
    PORTVERSION=    1.2p4

In this case, using DISTVERSION is not possible because it would
generate a version of 1.2.p4 which would be before 1.2 and not after.
pkg-version(8) will verify this:

    % pkg version -t 1.2 1.2.p4
    > (1)
    % pkg version -t 1.2 1.2p4
    < (2)

  --- ---------------------------------------------------
  1   1.2 is after 1.2.p4, which is wrong in this case.
  2   1.2 is before 1.2p4, which is what was needed.
  --- ---------------------------------------------------

For some more advanced examples of setting PORTVERSION, when the
software’s versioning is really not compatible with FreeBSD’s, or
DISTNAME when the distribution file does not contain the version itself,
see DISTNAME.

5.2.3. PORTREVISION and PORTEPOCH

5.2.3.1. PORTREVISION

PORTREVISION is a monotonically increasing value which is reset to 0
with every increase of DISTVERSION, typically every time there is a new
official vendor release. If PORTREVISION is non-zero, the value is
appended to the package name. Changes to PORTREVISION are used by
automated tools like pkg-version(8) to determine that a new package is
available.

PORTREVISION must be increased each time a change is made to the port
that changes the generated package in any way. That includes changes
that only affect a package built with non-default options.

Examples of when PORTREVISION must be bumped:

-   Addition of patches to correct security vulnerabilities, bugs, or to
    add new functionality to the port.

-   Changes to the port Makefile to enable or disable compile-time
    options in the package.

-   Changes in the packing list or the install-time behavior of the
    package. For example, a change to a script which generates initial
    data for the package, like ssh(1) host keys.

-   Version bump of a port’s shared library dependency (in this case,
    someone trying to install the old package after installing a newer
    version of the dependency will fail since it will look for the old
    libfoo.x instead of libfoo.(x+1)).

-   Silent changes to the port distfile which have significant
    functional differences. For example, changes to the distfile
    requiring a correction to distinfo with no corresponding change to
    DISTVERSION, where a diff -ru of the old and new versions shows
    non-trivial changes to the code.

-   Changes to MAINTAINER.

Examples of changes which do not require a PORTREVISION bump:

-   Style changes to the port skeleton with no functional change to what
    appears in the resulting package.

-   Changes to MASTER_SITES or other functional changes to the port
    which do not affect the resulting package.

-   Trivial patches to the distfile such as correction of typos, which
    are not important enough that users of the package have to go to the
    trouble of upgrading.

-   Build fixes which cause a package to become compilable where it was
    previously failing. As long as the changes do not introduce any
    functional change on any other platforms on which the port did
    previously build. Since PORTREVISION reflects the content of the
    package, if the package was not previously buildable then there is
    no need to increase PORTREVISION to mark a change.

A rule of thumb is to decide whether a change committed to a port is
something which some people would benefit from having. Either because of
an enhancement, fix, or by virtue that the new package will actually
work at all. Then weigh that against that fact that it will cause
everyone who regularly updates their ports tree to be compelled to
update. If yes, PORTREVISION must be bumped.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | People using binary packages will |
|                                   | never see the update if           |
|                                   | PORTREVISION is not bumped.       |
|                                   | Without increasing PORTREVISION,  |
|                                   | the package builders have no way  |
|                                   | to detect the change and thus,    |
|                                   | will not rebuild the package.     |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

5.2.3.2. PORTEPOCH

From time to time a software vendor or FreeBSD porter will do something
silly and release a version of their software which is actually
numerically less than the previous version. An example of this is a port
which goes from foo-20000801 to foo-1.0 (the former will be incorrectly
treated as a newer version since 20000801 is a numerically greater value
than 1).

In situations such as this, PORTEPOCH must be increased. If PORTEPOCH is
nonzero it is appended to the package name as described in section 0
above. PORTEPOCH must never be decreased or reset to zero, because that
would cause comparison to a package from an earlier epoch to fail. For
example, the package would not be detected as out of date. The new
version number, 1.0,1 in the above example, is still numerically less
than the previous version, 20000801, but the ,1 suffix is treated
specially by automated tools and found to be greater than the implied
suffix ,0 on the earlier package.

Dropping or resetting PORTEPOCH incorrectly leads to no end of grief. If
the discussion above was not clear enough, please consult the FreeBSD
ports mailing list.

It is expected that PORTEPOCH will not be used for the majority of
ports, and that sensible use of DISTVERSION, or that use PORTVERSION
carefully, can often preempt it becoming necessary if a future release
of the software changes the version structure. However, care is needed
by FreeBSD porters when a vendor release is made without an official
version number - such as a code "snapshot" release. The temptation is to
label the release with the release date, which will cause problems as in
the example above when a new "official" release is made.

For example, if a snapshot release is made on the date 20000917, and the
previous version of the software was version 1.2, do not use 20000917
for DISTVERSION. The correct way is a DISTVERSION of 1.2.20000917, or
similar, so that the succeeding release, say 1.3, is still a numerically
greater value.

5.2.3.3. Example of PORTREVISION and PORTEPOCH Usage

The gtkmumble port, version 0.10, is committed to the ports collection:

    PORTNAME=   gtkmumble
    DISTVERSION=    0.10

PKGNAME becomes gtkmumble-0.10.

A security hole is discovered which requires a local FreeBSD patch.
PORTREVISION is bumped accordingly.

    PORTNAME=    gtkmumble
    DISTVERSION=    0.10
    PORTREVISION=   1

PKGNAME becomes gtkmumble-0.10_1

A new version is released by the vendor, numbered 0.2 (it turns out the
author actually intended 0.10 to actually mean 0.1.0, not "what comes
after 0.9" - oops, too late now). Since the new minor version 2 is
numerically less than the previous version 10, PORTEPOCH must be bumped
to manually force the new package to be detected as "newer". Since it is
a new vendor release of the code, PORTREVISION is reset to 0 (or removed
from the Makefile).

    PORTNAME=   gtkmumble
    DISTVERSION=    0.2
    PORTEPOCH=  1

PKGNAME becomes gtkmumble-0.2,1

The next release is 0.3. Since PORTEPOCH never decreases, the version
variables are now:

    PORTNAME=    gtkmumble
    DISTVERSION=    0.3
    PORTEPOCH=  1

PKGNAME becomes gtkmumble-0.3,1

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | If PORTEPOCH were reset to 0 with |
|                                   | this upgrade, someone who had     |
|                                   | installed the gtkmumble-0.10_1    |
|                                   | package would not detect the      |
|                                   | gtkmumble-0.3 package as newer,   |
|                                   | since 3 is still numerically less |
|                                   | than 10. Remember, this is the    |
|                                   | whole point of PORTEPOCH in the   |
|                                   | first place.                      |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

5.2.4. PKGNAMEPREFIX and PKGNAMESUFFIX

Two optional variables, PKGNAMEPREFIX and PKGNAMESUFFIX, are combined
with PORTNAME and PORTVERSION to form PKGNAME as
${PKGNAMEPREFIX}${PORTNAME}${PKGNAMESUFFIX}-${PORTVERSION}. Make sure
this conforms to our guidelines for a good package name. In particular,
the use of a hyphen (-) in PORTVERSION is not allowed. Also, if the
package name has the language- or the -compiled.specifics part (see
below), use PKGNAMEPREFIX and PKGNAMESUFFIX, respectively. Do not make
them part of PORTNAME.

5.2.5. Package Naming Conventions

These are the conventions to follow when naming packages. This is to
make the package directory easy to scan, as there are already thousands
of packages and users are going to turn away if they hurt their eyes!

Package names take the form of
language_region-name-compiled.specifics-version.numbers.

The package name is defined as
${PKGNAMEPREFIX}${PORTNAME}${PKGNAMESUFFIX}-${PORTVERSION}. Make sure to
set the variables to conform to that format.

language_region-

    FreeBSD strives to support the native language of its users. The
    language- part is a two letter abbreviation of the natural language
    defined by ISO-639 when the port is specific to a certain language.
    Examples are ja for Japanese, ru for Russian, vi for Vietnamese, zh
    for Chinese, ko for Korean and de for German.

    If the port is specific to a certain region within the language
    area, add the two letter country code as well. Examples are en_US
    for US English and fr_CH for Swiss French.

    The language- part is set in PKGNAMEPREFIX.

name

    Make sure that the port’s name and version are clearly separated and
    placed into PORTNAME and DISTVERSION. The only reason for PORTNAME
    to contain a version part is if the upstream distribution is really
    named that way, as in the textproc/libxml2 or
    japanese/kinput2-freewnn ports. Otherwise, PORTNAME cannot contain
    any version-specific information. It is quite normal for several
    ports to have the same PORTNAME, as the www/apache* ports do; in
    that case, different versions (and different index entries) are
    distinguished by PKGNAMEPREFIX and PKGNAMESUFFIX values.

    There is a tradition of naming Perl 5 modules by prepending p5- and
    converting the double-colon separator to a hyphen. For example, the
    Data::Dumper module becomes p5-Data-Dumper.

-compiled.specifics

    If the port can be built with different hardcoded defaults (usually
    part of the directory name in a family of ports), the
    -compiled.specifics part states the compiled-in defaults. The hyphen
    is optional. Examples are paper size and font units.

    The -compiled.specifics part is set in PKGNAMESUFFIX.

-version.numbers

    The version string follows a dash (-) and is a period-separated list
    of integers and single lowercase alphabetics. In particular, it is
    not permissible to have another dash inside the version string. The
    only exception is the string pl (meaning "patchlevel"), which can be
    used only when there are no major and minor version numbers in the
    software. If the software version has strings like "alpha", "beta",
    "rc", or "pre", take the first letter and put it immediately after a
    period. If the version string continues after those names, the
    numbers follow the single alphabet without an extra period between
    them (for example, 1.0b2).

    The idea is to make it easier to sort ports by looking at the
    version string. In particular, make sure version number components
    are always delimited by a period, and if the date is part of the
    string, use the dyyyy.mm.dd format, not dd.mm.yyyy or the non-Y2K
    compliant yy.mm.dd format. It is important to prefix the version
    with a letter, here d (for date), in case a release with an actual
    version number is made, which would be numerically less than yyyy.

Here are some (real) examples on how to convert the name as called by
the software authors to a suitable package name, for each line, only one
of DISTVERSION or PORTVERSION is set in, depending on which would be
used in the port’s Makefile:

: Table 2. Package Naming Examples

If there is absolutely no trace of version information in the original
source and it is unlikely that the original author will ever release
another version, just set the version string to 1.0 (like the piewm
example above). Otherwise, ask the original author or use the date
string the source file was released on (dyyyy.mm.dd, or dyyyymmdd) as
the version.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Use any letter. Here, d here      |
|                                   | stands for date, if the source is |
|                                   | a Git repository, g followed by   |
|                                   | the commit date is commonly used, |
|                                   | using s for snapshot is also      |
|                                   | common.                           |

5.3. Categorization

5.3.1. CATEGORIES

When a package is created, it is put under /usr/ports/packages/All and
links are made from one or more subdirectories of /usr/ports/packages.
The names of these subdirectories are specified by the variable
CATEGORIES. It is intended to make life easier for the user when he is
wading through the pile of packages on the FTP site or the CDROM. Please
take a look at the current list of categories and pick the ones that are
suitable for the port.

This list also determines where in the ports tree the port is imported.
If there is more than one category here, the port files must be put in
the subdirectory with the name of the first category. See below for more
discussion about how to pick the right categories.

5.3.2. Current List of Categories

Here is the current list of port categories. Those marked with an
asterisk (*) are virtual categories-those that do not have a
corresponding subdirectory in the ports tree. They are only used as
secondary categories, and only for search purposes.

5.3.3. Choosing the Right Category

As many of the categories overlap, choosing which of the categories will
be the primary category of the port can be tedious. There are several
rules that govern this issue. Here is the list of priorities, in
decreasing order of precedence:

-   The first category must be a physical category (see above). This is
    necessary to make the packaging work. Virtual categories and
    physical categories may be intermixed after that.

-   Language specific categories always come first. For example, if the
    port installs Japanese X11 fonts, then the CATEGORIES line would
    read japanese x11-fonts.

-   Specific categories are listed before less-specific ones. For
    instance, an HTML editor is listed as www editors, not the other way
    around. Also, do not list net when the port belongs to any of irc,
    mail, news, security, or www, as net is included implicitly.

-   x11 is used as a secondary category only when the primary category
    is a natural language. In particular, do not put x11 in the category
    line for X applications.

-   Emacs modes are placed in the same ports category as the application
    supported by the mode, not in editors. For example, an Emacs mode to
    edit source files of some programming language goes into lang.

-   Ports installing loadable kernel modules also have the virtual
    category kld in their CATEGORIES line. This is one of the things
    handled automatically by adding USES=kmod.

-   misc does not appear with any other non-virtual category. If there
    is misc with something else in CATEGORIES, that means misc can
    safely be deleted and the port placed only in the other
    subdirectory.

-   If the port truly does not belong anywhere else, put it in misc.

If the category is not clearly defined, please put a comment to that
effect in the port submission in the bug database so we can discuss it
before we import it. As a committer, send a note to the FreeBSD ports
mailing list so we can discuss it first. Too often, new ports are
imported to the wrong category only to be moved right away.

5.3.4. Proposing a New Category

As the Ports Collection has grown over time, various new categories have
been introduced. New categories can either be virtual categories-those
that do not have a corresponding subdirectory in the ports tree- or
physical categories-those that do. This section discusses the issues
involved in creating a new physical category. Read it thoroughly before
proposing a new one.

Our existing practice has been to avoid creating a new physical category
unless either a large number of ports would logically belong to it, or
the ports that would belong to it are a logically distinct group that is
of limited general interest (for instance, categories related to spoken
human languages), or preferably both.

The rationale for this is that such a change creates a fair amount of
work for both the committers and also for all users who track changes to
the Ports Collection. In addition, proposed category changes just
naturally seem to attract controversy. (Perhaps this is because there is
no clear consensus on when a category is "too big", nor whether
categories should lend themselves to browsing (and thus what number of
categories would be an ideal number), and so forth.)

Here is the procedure:

1.  Propose the new category on FreeBSD ports mailing list. Include a
    detailed rationale for the new category, including why the existing
    categories are not sufficient, and the list of existing ports
    proposed to move. (If there are new ports pending in Bugzilla that
    would fit this category, list them too.) If you are the maintainer
    and/or submitter, respectively, mention that as it may help the
    case.

2.  Participate in the discussion.

3.  If it seems that there is support for the idea, file a PR which
    includes both the rationale and the list of existing ports that need
    to be moved. Ideally, this PR would also include these patches:

    -   Makefiles for the new ports once they are repocopied

    -   Makefile for the new category

    -   Makefile for the old ports' categories

    -   Makefiles for ports that depend on the old ports

    -   (for extra credit, include the other files that have to change,
        as per the procedure in the Committer’s Guide.)

4.  Since it affects the ports infrastructure and involves moving and
    patching many ports but also possibly running regression tests on
    the build cluster, assign the PR to the Ports Management Team
    <portmgr@FreeBSD.org>.

5.  If that PR is approved, a committer will need to follow the rest of
    the procedure that is outlined in the Committer’s Guide.

Proposing a new virtual category is similar to the above but much less
involved, since no ports will actually have to move. In this case, the
only patches to include in the PR would be those to add the new category
to CATEGORIES of the affected ports.

5.3.5. Proposing Reorganizing All the Categories

Occasionally someone proposes reorganizing the categories with either a
2-level structure, or some other kind of keyword structure. To date,
nothing has come of any of these proposals because, while they are very
easy to make, the effort involved to retrofit the entire existing ports
collection with any kind of reorganization is daunting to say the very
least. Please read the history of these proposals in the mailing list
archives before posting this idea. Furthermore, be prepared to be
challenged to offer a working prototype.

5.4. The Distribution Files

The second part of the Makefile describes the files that must be
downloaded to build the port, and where they can be downloaded.

5.4.1. DISTNAME

DISTNAME is the name of the port as called by the authors of the
software. DISTNAME defaults to
${PORTNAME}-${DISTVERSIONPREFIX}${DISTVERSION}${DISTVERSIONSUFFIX}, and
if not set, DISTVERSION defaults to ${PORTVERSION} so override DISTNAME
only if necessary. DISTNAME is only used in two places. First, the
distribution file list (DISTFILES) defaults to
${DISTNAME}${EXTRACT_SUFX}. Second, the distribution file is expected to
extract into a subdirectory named WRKSRC, which defaults to
work/${DISTNAME}.

Some vendor’s distribution names which do not fit into the
${PORTNAME}-${PORTVERSION}-scheme can be handled automatically by
setting DISTVERSIONPREFIX, DISTVERSION, and DISTVERSIONSUFFIX.
PORTVERSION will be derived from DISTVERSION automatically.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Only one of PORTVERSION and       |
|                                   | DISTVERSION can be set at a time. |
|                                   | If DISTVERSION does not derive a  |
|                                   | correct PORTVERSION, do not use   |
|                                   | DISTVERSION.                      |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

If the upstream version scheme can be derived into a ports-compatible
version scheme, set some variable to the upstream version, do not use
DISTVERSION as the variable name. Set PORTVERSION to the computed
version based on the variable you created, and set DISTNAME accordingly.

If the upstream version scheme cannot easily be coerced into a
ports-compatible value, set PORTVERSION to a sensible value, and set
DISTNAME with PORTNAME with the verbatim upstream version.

Example 10. Deriving PORTVERSION Manually

BIND9 uses a version scheme that is not compatible with the ports
versions (it has - in its versions) and cannot be derived using
DISTVERSION because after the 9.9.9 release, it will release a
"patchlevels" in the form of 9.9.9-P1. DISTVERSION would translate that
into 9.9.9.p1, which, in the ports versioning scheme means 9.9.9
pre-release 1, which is before 9.9.9 and not after. So PORTVERSION is
manually derived from an ISCVERSION variable to output 9.9.9p1.

The order into which the ports framework, and pkg, will sort versions is
checked using the -t argument of pkg-version(8):

    % pkg version -t 9.9.9 9.9.9.p1
    > (1)
    % pkg version -t 9.9.9 9.9.9p1
    < (2)

  --- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1   The > sign means that the first argument passed to -t is greater than the second argument. 9.9.9 is after 9.9.9.p1.
  2   The < sign means that the first argument passed to -t is less than the second argument. 9.9.9 is before 9.9.9p1.
  --- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the port Makefile, for example dns/bind99, it is achieved by:

    PORTNAME=   bind
    PORTVERSION=    ${ISCVERSION:S/-P/P/:S/b/.b/:S/a/.a/:S/rc/.rc/}
    CATEGORIES= dns net
    MASTER_SITES=   ISC/bind9/${ISCVERSION}
    PKGNAMESUFFIX=  99
    DISTNAME=   ${PORTNAME}-${ISCVERSION}

    MAINTAINER= mat@FreeBSD.org
    COMMENT=    BIND DNS suite with updated DNSSEC and DNS64
    WWW=        https://www.isc.org/bind/

    LICENSE=    ISCL

    # ISC releases things like 9.8.0-P1 or 9.8.1rc1, which our versioning does not like
    ISCVERSION= 9.9.9-P6

Define upstream version in ISCVERSION, with a comment saying why it is
needed. Use ISCVERSION to get a ports-compatible PORTVERSION. Use
ISCVERSION directly to get the correct URL for fetching the distribution
file. Use ISCVERSION directly to name the distribution file.

Example 11. Derive DISTNAME from PORTVERSION

From time to time, the distribution file name has little or no relation
to the version of the software.

In comms/kermit, only the last element of the version is present in the
distribution file:

    PORTNAME=   kermit
    PORTVERSION=    9.0.304
    CATEGORIES= comms ftp net
    MASTER_SITES=   ftp://ftp.kermitproject.org/kermit/test/tar/
    DISTNAME=   cku${PORTVERSION:E}-dev20

The :E make(1) modifier returns the suffix of the variable, in this
case, 304. The distribution file is correctly generated as
cku304-dev20.tar.gz.

Example 12. Exotic Case 1

Sometimes, there is no relation between the software name, its version,
and the distribution file it is distributed in.

From audio/libworkman:

    PORTNAME=       libworkman
    PORTVERSION=    1.4
    CATEGORIES=     audio
    MASTER_SITES=   LOCAL/jim
    DISTNAME=       ${PORTNAME}-1999-06-20

Example 13. Exotic Case 2

In comms/librs232, the distribution file is not versioned, so using
DIST_SUBDIR is needed:

    PORTNAME=       librs232
    PORTVERSION=    20160710
    CATEGORIES=     comms
    MASTER_SITES=   http://www.teuniz.net/RS-232/
    DISTNAME=       RS-232
    DIST_SUBDIR=    ${PORTNAME}-${PORTVERSION}

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | PKGNAMEPREFIX and PKGNAMESUFFIX   |
|                                   | do not affect DISTNAME. Also note |
|                                   | that if WRKSRC is equal to        |
|                                   | ${WRKDIR}/${DISTNAME} while the   |
|                                   | original source archive is named  |
|                                   | something other than              |
|                                   | ${PORTNAM                         |
|                                   | E}-${PORTVERSION}${EXTRACT_SUFX}, |
|                                   | leave DISTNAME alone- defining    |
|                                   | only DISTFILES is easier than     |
|                                   | both DISTNAME and WRKSRC (and     |
|                                   | possibly EXTRACT_SUFX).           |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

5.4.2. MASTER_SITES

Record the directory part of the FTP/HTTP-URL pointing at the original
tarball in MASTER_SITES. Do not forget the trailing slash (/)!

The make macros will try to use this specification for grabbing the
distribution file with FETCH if they cannot find it already on the
system.

It is recommended that multiple sites are included on this list,
preferably from different continents. This will safeguard against
wide-area network problems.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | MASTER_SITES must not be blank.   |
|                                   | It must point to the actual site  |
|                                   | hosting the distribution files.   |
|                                   | It cannot point to web archives,  |
|                                   | or the FreeBSD distribution files |
|                                   | cache sites. The only exception   |
|                                   | to this rule is ports that do not |
|                                   | have any distribution files. For  |
|                                   | example, meta-ports do not have   |
|                                   | any distribution files, so        |
|                                   | MASTER_SITES does not need to be  |
|                                   | set.                              |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

5.4.2.1. Using MASTER_SITE_* Variables

Shortcut abbreviations are available for popular archives like
SourceForge (SOURCEFORGE), GNU (GNU), or Perl CPAN (PERL_CPAN).
MASTER_SITES can use them directly:

    MASTER_SITES= GNU/make

The older expanded format still works, but all ports have been converted
to the compact format. The expanded format looks like this:

    MASTER_SITES=        ${MASTER_SITE_GNU}
    MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR= make

These values and variables are defined in Mk/bsd.sites.mk. New entries
are added often, so make sure to check the latest version of this file
before submitting a port.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | For any MASTER_SITE_FOO variable, |
|                                   | the shorthand FOO can be used.    |
|                                   | For example, use:                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   |     MASTER_SITES=   FOO           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR is needed,  |
|                                   | use this:                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   |     MASTER_SITES=    FOO/bar      |

5.4.2.2. Magic MASTER_SITES Macros

Several "magic" macros exist for popular sites with a predictable
directory structure. For these, just use the abbreviation and the system
will choose a subdirectory automatically. For a port named Stardict, of
version 1.2.3, and hosted on SourceForge, adding this line:

    MASTER_SITES= SF

infers a subdirectory named /project/stardict/stardict/1.2.3. If the
inferred directory is incorrect, it can be overridden:

    MASTER_SITES=   SF/stardict/WyabdcRealPeopleTTS/${PORTVERSION}

This can also be written as

    MASTER_SITES= SF
    MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR= stardict/WyabdcRealPeopleTTS/${PORTVERSION}

5.4.3. USE_GITHUB

If the distribution file comes from a specific commit or tag on GitHub
for which there is no officially released file, there is an easy way to
set the right DISTNAME and MASTER_SITES automatically. These variables
are available:

+----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+

|                      | here is incorrect.   |                       |
|                      | It is also possible  |                       |
|                      | to use the hash of a |                       |
|                      | commit id to do a    |                       |

Example 14. Simple Use of USE_GITHUB

While trying to make a port for version 1.2.7 of pkg from the FreeBSD
user on github, at https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/, The Makefile would
end up looking like this (slightly stripped for the example):

    PORTNAME=  pkg
    DISTVERSION=    1.2.7

    USE_GITHUB= yes
    GH_ACCOUNT= freebsd

It will automatically have MASTER_SITES set to GH and WRKSRC to
${WRKDIR}/pkg-1.2.7.

Example 15. More Complete Use of USE_GITHUB

While trying to make a port for the bleeding edge version of pkg from
the FreeBSD user on github, at https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/, the
Makefile ends up looking like this (slightly stripped for the example):

    PORTNAME=   pkg-devel
    DISTVERSION=    1.3.0.a.20140411

    USE_GITHUB= yes
    GH_ACCOUNT= freebsd
    GH_PROJECT= pkg
    GH_TAGNAME= 6dbb17b

It will automatically have MASTER_SITES set to GH and WRKSRC to
${WRKDIR}/pkg-6dbb17b.

20140411 is the date of the commit referenced in GH_TAGNAME, not the
date the Makefile is edited, or the date the commit is made.

Example 16. Use of USE_GITHUB with DISTVERSIONPREFIX

From time to time, GH_TAGNAME is a slight variation from DISTVERSION.
For example, if the version is 1.0.2, the tag is v1.0.2. In those cases,
it is possible to use DISTVERSIONPREFIX or DISTVERSIONSUFFIX:

    PORTNAME= foo
    DISTVERSIONPREFIX=  v
    DISTVERSION=    1.0.2

    USE_GITHUB= yes

It will automatically set GH_TAGNAME to v1.0.2, while WRKSRC will be
kept to ${WRKDIR}/foo-1.0.2.

Example 17. Using USE_GITHUB When Upstream Does Not Use Versions

If there never was a version upstream, do not invent one like 0.1 or
1.0. Create the port with a DISTVERSION of gYYYYMMDD, where g is for
Git, and YYYYMMDD represents the date the commit referenced in
GH_TAGNAME.

    PORTNAME=   bar
    DISTVERSION=    g20140411

    USE_GITHUB= yes
    GH_TAGNAME= c472d66b

This creates a versioning scheme that increases over time, and that is
still before version 0 (see Using pkg-version(8) to Compare Versions for
details on pkg-version(8)):

    % pkg version -t g20140411 0
    <

Which means using PORTEPOCH will not be needed in case upstream decides
to cut versions in the future.

Example 18. Using USE_GITHUB to Access a Commit Between Two Versions

If the current version of the software uses a Git tag, and the port
needs to be updated to a newer, intermediate version, without a tag, use
git-describe(1) to find out the version to use:

    % git describe --tags f0038b1
    v0.7.3-14-gf0038b1

v0.7.3-14-gf0038b1 can be split into three parts:

v0.7.3

    This is the last Git tag that appears in the commit history before
    the requested commit.

-14

    This means that the requested commit, f0038b1, is the 14th commit
    after the v0.7.3 tag.

-gf0038b1

    The -g means "Git", and the f0038b1 is the commit hash that this
    reference points to.

    PORTNAME=  bar
    DISTVERSIONPREFIX=  v
    DISTVERSION=    0.7.3-14
    DISTVERSIONSUFFIX=  -gf0038b1

    USE_GITHUB= yes

This creates a versioning scheme that increases over time (well, over
commits), and does not conflict with the creation of a 0.7.4 version.
(See Using pkg-version(8) to Compare Versions for details on
pkg-version(8)):

    % pkg version -t 0.7.3 0.7.3.14
    <
    % pkg version -t 0.7.3.14 0.7.4
    <

If the requested commit is the same as a tag, a shorter description is
shown by default. The longer version is equivalent:

    % git describe --tags c66c71d
    v0.7.3

    % git describe --tags --long c66c71d
    v0.7.3-0-gc66c71d

5.4.3.1. Fetching Multiple Files from GitHub

The USE_GITHUB framework also supports fetching multiple distribution
files from different places in GitHub. It works in a way very similar to
Multiple Distribution or Patches Files from Multiple Locations.

Multiple values are added to GH_ACCOUNT, GH_PROJECT, and GH_TAGNAME.
Each different value is assigned a group. The main value can either have
no group, or the :DEFAULT group. A value can be omitted if it is the
same as the default as listed in USE_GITHUB Description.

GH_TUPLE can also be used when there are a lot of distribution files. It
helps keep the account, project, tagname, and group information at the
same place.

For each group, a ${WRKSRC_group} helper variable is created, containing
the directory into which the file has been extracted. The
${WRKSRC_group} variables can be used to move directories around during
post-extract, or add to CONFIGURE_ARGS, or whatever is needed so that
the software builds correctly.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | The :group part must be used for  |
|                                   | only one distribution file. It is |
|                                   | used as a unique key and using it |
|                                   | more than once will overwrite the |
|                                   | previous values.                  |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | As this is only syntactic sugar   |
|                                   | above DISTFILES and MASTER_SITES, |
|                                   | the group names must adhere to    |
|                                   | the restrictions on group names   |
|                                   | outlined in Multiple Distribution |
|                                   | or Patches Files from Multiple    |
|                                   | Locations                         |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

When fetching multiple files from GitHub, sometimes the default
distribution file is not fetched from GitHub. To disable fetching the
default distribution, set:

    USE_GITHUB=    nodefault

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | When using USE_GITHUB=nodefault,  |
|                                   | the Makefile must set DISTFILES   |
|                                   | in its top block. The definition  |
|                                   | should be:                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   |     DISTFIL                       |
|                                   | ES=    ${DISTNAME}${EXTRACT_SUFX} |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Example 19. Use of USE_GITHUB with Multiple Distribution Files

From time to time, there is a need to fetch more than one distribution
file. For example, when the upstream git repository uses submodules.
This can be done easily using groups in the GH_* variables:

    PORTNAME=    foo
    DISTVERSION=    1.0.2

    USE_GITHUB= yes
    GH_ACCOUNT= bar:icons,contrib
    GH_PROJECT= foo-icons:icons foo-contrib:contrib
    GH_TAGNAME= 1.0:icons fa579bc:contrib
    GH_SUBDIR=  ext/icons:icons

    CONFIGURE_ARGS= --with-contrib=${WRKSRC_contrib}

This will fetch three distribution files from github. The default one
comes from foo/foo and is version 1.0.2. The second one, with the icons
group, comes from bar/foo-icons and is in version 1.0. The third one
comes from bar/foo-contrib and uses the Git commit fa579bc. The
distribution files are named foo-foo-1.0.2_GH0.tar.gz,
bar-foo-icons-1.0_GH0.tar.gz, and bar-foo-contrib-fa579bc_GH0.tar.gz.

All the distribution files are extracted in ${WRKDIR} in their
respective subdirectories. The default file is still extracted in
${WRKSRC}, in this case, ${WRKDIR}/foo-1.0.2. Each additional
distribution file is extracted in ${WRKSRC_group}. Here, for the icons
group, it is called ${WRKSRC_icons} and it contains
${WRKDIR}/foo-icons-1.0. The file with the contrib group is called
${WRKSRC_contrib} and contains ${WRKDIR}/foo-contrib-fa579bc.

The software’s build system expects to find the icons in a ext/icons
subdirectory in its sources, so GH_SUBDIR is used. GH_SUBDIR makes sure
that ext exists, but that ext/icons does not already exist. Then it does
this:

    post-extract:
          @${MV} ${WRKSRC_icons} ${WRKSRC}/ext/icons

Example 20. Use of USE_GITHUB with Multiple Distribution Files Using
GH_TUPLE

This is functionally equivalent to Use of USE_GITHUB with Multiple
Distribution Files, but using GH_TUPLE:

    PORTNAME=  foo
    DISTVERSION=    1.0.2

    USE_GITHUB= yes
    GH_TUPLE=   bar:foo-icons:1.0:icons/ext/icons \
            bar:foo-contrib:fa579bc:contrib

    CONFIGURE_ARGS= --with-contrib=${WRKSRC_contrib}

Grouping was used in the previous example with bar:icons,contrib. Some
redundant information is present with GH_TUPLE because grouping is not
possible.

Example 21. How to Use USE_GITHUB with Git Submodules?

Ports with GitHub as an upstream repository sometimes use submodules.
See git-submodule(1) for more information.

The problem with submodules is that each is a separate repository. As
such, they each must be fetched separately.

Using finance/moneymanagerex as an example, its GitHub repository is
https://github.com/moneymanagerex/moneymanagerex/. It has a .gitmodules
file at the root. This file describes all the submodules used in this
repository, and lists additional repositories needed. This file will
tell what additional repositories are needed:

    [submodule "lib/wxsqlite3"]
        path = lib/wxsqlite3
        url = https://github.com/utelle/wxsqlite3.git
    [submodule "3rd/mongoose"]
        path = 3rd/mongoose
        url = https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose.git
    [submodule "3rd/LuaGlue"]
        path = 3rd/LuaGlue
        url = https://github.com/moneymanagerex/LuaGlue.git
    [submodule "3rd/cgitemplate"]
        path = 3rd/cgitemplate
        url = https://github.com/moneymanagerex/html-template.git
    [...]

The only information missing from that file is the commit hash or tag to
use as a version. This information is found after cloning the
repository:

    % git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/moneymanagerex/moneymanagerex.git
    Cloning into 'moneymanagerex'...
    remote: Counting objects: 32387, done.

It can also be found on GitHub. Each subdirectory that is a submodule is
shown as directory @ hash, for example, mongoose @ 2140e59.

While getting the information from GitHub seems more straightforward,
the information found using git submodule status will provide more
meaningful information. For example, here, lib/wxsqlite3's commit hash
fb66eb2 correspond to v3.4.0. Both can be used interchangeably, but when
a tag is available, use it.

Now that all the required information has been gathered, the Makefile
can be written (only GitHub-related lines are shown):

5.4.4. USE_GITLAB

Similar to GitHub, if the distribution file comes from gitlab.com or is
hosting the GitLab software, these variables are available for use and
might need to be set.

: Table 6. USE_GITLAB Description

Example 22. Simple Use of USE_GITLAB

While trying to make a port for version 1.14 of libsignon-glib from the
accounts-sso user on gitlab.com, at
https://gitlab.com/accounts-sso/libsignon-glib/, The Makefile would end
up looking like this for fetching the distribution files:

    PORTNAME= libsignon-glib
    DISTVERSION=    1.14

    USE_GITLAB= yes
    GL_ACCOUNT= accounts-sso
    GL_COMMIT=  e90302e342bfd27bc8c9132ab9d0ea3d8723fd03

It will automatically have MASTER_SITES set to gitlab.com and WRKSRC to
${WRKDIR}/libsignon-glib-e90302e342bfd27bc8c9132ab9d0ea3d8723fd03-e90302e342bfd27bc8c9132ab9d0ea3d8723fd03.

Example 23. More Complete Use of USE_GITLAB

A more complete use of the above if port had no versioning and foobar
from the foo user on project bar on a self hosted GitLab site
https://gitlab.example.com/, the Makefile ends up looking like this for
fetching distribution files:

    PORTNAME=    foobar
    DISTVERSION=    g20170906

    USE_GITLAB= yes
    GL_SITE=    https://gitlab.example.com
    GL_ACCOUNT= foo
    GL_PROJECT= bar
    GL_COMMIT=  9c1669ce60c3f4f5eb43df874d7314483fb3f8a6

It will have MASTER_SITES set to "https://gitlab.example.com" and WRKSRC
to
${WRKDIR}/bar-9c1669ce60c3f4f5eb43df874d7314483fb3f8a6-9c1669ce60c3f4f5eb43df874d7314483fb3f8a6.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | 20170906 is the date of the       |
|                                   | commit referenced in GL_COMMIT,   |
|                                   | not the date the Makefile is      |
|                                   | edited, or the date the commit to |
|                                   | the FreeBSD ports tree is made.   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | GL_SITE's protocol, port and      |
|                                   | webroot can all be modified in    |
|                                   | the same variable.                |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

5.4.4.1. Fetching Multiple Files from GitLab

The USE_GITLAB framework also supports fetching multiple distribution
files from different places from GitLab and GitLab hosted sites. It
works in a way very similar to Multiple Distribution or Patches Files
from Multiple Locations and Fetching Multiple Files from GitLab.

Multiple values are added to GL_SITE, GL_ACCOUNT, GL_PROJECT and
GL_COMMIT. Each different value is assigned a group. USE_GITLAB
Description.

GL_TUPLE can also be used when there are a lot of distribution files. It
helps keep the site, account, project, commit, and group information at
the same place.

For each group, a ${WRKSRC_group} helper variable is created, containing
the directory into which the file has been extracted. The
${WRKSRC_group} variables can be used to move directories around during
post-extract, or add to CONFIGURE_ARGS, or whatever is needed so that
the software builds correctly.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | The :group part must be used for  |
|                                   | only one distribution file. It is |
|                                   | used as a unique key and using it |
|                                   | more than once will overwrite the |
|                                   | previous values.                  |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | As this is only syntactic sugar   |
|                                   | above DISTFILES and MASTER_SITES, |
|                                   | the group names must adhere to    |
|                                   | the restrictions on group names   |
|                                   | outlined in Multiple Distribution |
|                                   | or Patches Files from Multiple    |
|                                   | Locations                         |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

When fetching multiple files using GitLab, sometimes the default
distribution file is not fetched from a GitLab site. To disable fetching
the default distribution, set:

    USE_GITLAB=    nodefault

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | When using USE_GITLAB=nodefault,  |
|                                   | the Makefile must set DISTFILES   |
|                                   | in its top block. The definition  |
|                                   | should be:                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   |     DISTFIL                       |
|                                   | ES=    ${DISTNAME}${EXTRACT_SUFX} |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Example 24. Use of USE_GITLAB with Multiple Distribution Files

From time to time, there is a need to fetch more than one distribution
file. For example, when the upstream git repository uses submodules.
This can be done easily using groups in the GL_* variables:

    PORTNAME=    foo
    DISTVERSION=    1.0.2

    USE_GITLAB= yes
    GL_SITE=    https://gitlab.example.com:9434/gitlab:icons
    GL_ACCOUNT= bar:icons,contrib
    GL_PROJECT= foo-icons:icons foo-contrib:contrib
    GL_COMMIT=  c189207a55da45305c884fe2b50e086fcad4724b ae7368cab1ca7ca754b38d49da064df87968ffe4:icons 9e4dd76ad9b38f33fdb417a4c01935958d5acd2a:contrib
    GL_SUBDIR=  ext/icons:icons

    CONFIGURE_ARGS= --with-contrib=${WRKSRC_contrib}

This will fetch two distribution files from gitlab.com and one from
gitlab.example.com hosting GitLab. The default one comes from
https://gitlab.com/foo/foo and commit is
c189207a55da45305c884fe2b50e086fcad4724b. The second one, with the icons
group, comes from https://gitlab.example.com:9434/gitlab/bar/foo-icons
and commit is ae7368cab1ca7ca754b38d49da064df87968ffe4. The third one
comes from https://gitlab.com/bar/foo-contrib and is commit
9e4dd76ad9b38f33fdb417a4c01935958d5acd2a. The distribution files are
named foo-foo-c189207a55da45305c884fe2b50e086fcad4724b_GL0.tar.gz,
bar-foo-icons-ae7368cab1ca7ca754b38d49da064df87968ffe4_GL0.tar.gz, and
bar-foo-contrib-9e4dd76ad9b38f33fdb417a4c01935958d5acd2a_GL0.tar.gz.

All the distribution files are extracted in ${WRKDIR} in their
respective subdirectories. The default file is still extracted in
${WRKSRC}, in this case,
${WRKDIR}/foo-c189207a55da45305c884fe2b50e086fcad4724b-c189207a55da45305c884fe2b50e086fcad4724b.
Each additional distribution file is extracted in ${WRKSRC_group}. Here,
for the icons group, it is called ${WRKSRC_icons} and it contains
${WRKDIR}/foo-icons-ae7368cab1ca7ca754b38d49da064df87968ffe4-ae7368cab1ca7ca754b38d49da064df87968ffe4.
The file with the contrib group is called ${WRKSRC_contrib} and contains
${WRKDIR}/foo-contrib-9e4dd76ad9b38f33fdb417a4c01935958d5acd2a-9e4dd76ad9b38f33fdb417a4c01935958d5acd2a.

The software’s build system expects to find the icons in a ext/icons
subdirectory in its sources, so GL_SUBDIR is used. GL_SUBDIR makes sure
that ext exists, but that ext/icons does not already exist. Then it does
this:

    post-extract:
            @${MV} ${WRKSRC_icons} ${WRKSRC}/ext/icons

Example 25. Use of USE_GITLAB with Multiple Distribution Files Using
GL_TUPLE

This is functionally equivalent to Use of USE_GITLAB with Multiple
Distribution Files, but using GL_TUPLE:

    PORTNAME=    foo
    DISTVERSION=    1.0.2

    USE_GITLAB= yes
    GL_COMMIT=  c189207a55da45305c884fe2b50e086fcad4724b
    GL_TUPLE=   https://gitlab.example.com:9434/gitlab:bar:foo-icons:ae7368cab1ca7ca754b38d49da064df87968ffe4:icons/ext/icons \
            bar:foo-contrib:9e4dd76ad9b38f33fdb417a4c01935958d5acd2a:contrib

    CONFIGURE_ARGS= --with-contrib=${WRKSRC_contrib}

Grouping was used in the previous example with bar:icons,contrib. Some
redundant information is present with GL_TUPLE because grouping is not
possible.

5.4.5. EXTRACT_SUFX

If there is one distribution file, and it uses an odd suffix to indicate
the compression mechanism, set EXTRACT_SUFX.

For example, if the distribution file was named foo.tar.gzip instead of
the more normal foo.tar.gz, write:

    DISTNAME=   foo
    EXTRACT_SUFX=   .tar.gzip

The USES=tar[:xxx], USES=lha or USES=zip automatically set EXTRACT_SUFX
to the most common archives extensions as necessary, see Using USES
Macros for more details. If neither of these are set then EXTRACT_SUFX
defaults to .tar.gz.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | As EXTRACT_SUFX is only used in   |
|                                   | DISTFILES, only set one of them.. |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

5.4.6. DISTFILES

Sometimes the names of the files to be downloaded have no resemblance to
the name of the port. For example, it might be called source.tar.gz or
similar. In other cases the application’s source code might be in
several different archives, all of which must be downloaded.

If this is the case, set DISTFILES to be a space separated list of all
the files that must be downloaded.

    DISTFILES=  source1.tar.gz source2.tar.gz

If not explicitly set, DISTFILES defaults to ${DISTNAME}${EXTRACT_SUFX}.

5.4.7. EXTRACT_ONLY

If only some of the DISTFILES must be extracted-for example, one of them
is the source code, while another is an uncompressed document-list the
filenames that must be extracted in EXTRACT_ONLY.

    DISTFILES=    source.tar.gz manual.html
    EXTRACT_ONLY=   source.tar.gz

When none of the DISTFILES need to be uncompressed, set EXTRACT_ONLY to
the empty string.

    EXTRACT_ONLY=

5.4.8. PATCHFILES

If the port requires some additional patches that are available by FTP
or HTTP, set PATCHFILES to the names of the files and PATCH_SITES to the
URL of the directory that contains them (the format is the same as
MASTER_SITES).

If the patch is not relative to the top of the source tree (that is,
WRKSRC) because it contains some extra pathnames, set PATCH_DIST_STRIP
accordingly. For instance, if all the pathnames in the patch have an
extra foozolix-1.0/ in front of the filenames, then set
PATCH_DIST_STRIP=-p1.

Do not worry if the patches are compressed; they will be decompressed
automatically if the filenames end with .Z, .gz, .bz2 or .xz.

If the patch is distributed with some other files, such as
documentation, in a compressed tarball, using PATCHFILES is not
possible. If that is the case, add the name and the location of the
patch tarball to DISTFILES and MASTER_SITES. Then, use EXTRA_PATCHES to
point to those files and bsd.port.mk will automatically apply them. In
particular, do not copy patch files into ${PATCHDIR}. That directory may
not be writable.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | If there are multiple patches and |
|                                   | they need mixed values for the    |
|                                   | strip parameter, it can be added  |
|                                   | alongside the patch name in       |
|                                   | PATCHFILES, e.g:                  |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   |  PATCHFILES=    patch1 patch2:-p1 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This does not conflict with the   |
|                                   | master site grouping feature,     |
|                                   | adding a group also works:        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   |  PATCHFILES=   patch2:-p1:source2 |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | The tarball will have been        |
|                                   | extracted alongside the regular   |

5.4.9. Multiple Distribution or Patches Files from Multiple Locations

(Consider this to be a somewhat "advanced topic"; those new to this
document may wish to skip this section at first).

This section has information on the fetching mechanism known as both
MASTER_SITES:n and MASTER_SITES_NN. We will refer to this mechanism as
MASTER_SITES:n.

A little background first. OpenBSD has a neat feature inside DISTFILES
and PATCHFILES which allows files and patches to be postfixed with :n
identifiers. Here, n can be any word containing [0-9a-zA-Z_] and denote
a group designation. For example:

    DISTFILES=   alpha:0 beta:1

In OpenBSD, distribution file alpha will be associated with variable
MASTER_SITES0 instead of our common MASTER_SITES and beta with
MASTER_SITES1.

This is a very interesting feature which can decrease that endless
search for the correct download site.

Just picture 2 files in DISTFILES and 20 sites in MASTER_SITES, the
sites slow as hell where beta is carried by all sites in MASTER_SITES,
and alpha can only be found in the 20th site. It would be such a waste
to check all of them if the maintainer knew this beforehand, would it
not? Not a good start for that lovely weekend!

Now that you have the idea, just imagine more DISTFILES and more
MASTER_SITES. Surely our "distfiles survey meister" would appreciate the
relief to network strain that this would bring.

In the next sections, information will follow on the FreeBSD
implementation of this idea. We improved a bit on OpenBSD’s concept.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | The group names cannot have       |
|                                   | dashes in them (-), in fact, they |
|                                   | cannot have any characters out of |
|                                   | the [a-zA-Z0-9_] range. This is   |
|                                   | because, while make(1) is ok with |
|                                   | variable names containing dashes, |
|                                   | sh(1) is not.                     |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

5.4.9.1. Simplified Information

This section explains how to quickly prepare fine grained fetching of
multiple distribution files and patches from different sites and
subdirectories. We describe here a case of simplified MASTER_SITES:n
usage. This will be sufficient for most scenarios. More detailed
information are available in Detailed Information.

Some applications consist of multiple distribution files that must be
downloaded from a number of different sites. For example, Ghostscript
consists of the core of the program, and then a large number of driver
files that are used depending on the user’s printer. Some of these
driver files are supplied with the core, but many others must be
downloaded from a variety of different sites.

To support this, each entry in DISTFILES may be followed by a colon and
a "group name". Each site listed in MASTER_SITES is then followed by a
colon, and the group that indicates which distribution files are
downloaded from this site.

For example, consider an application with the source split in two parts,
source1.tar.gz and source2.tar.gz, which must be downloaded from two
different sites. The port’s Makefile would include lines like Simplified
Use of MASTER_SITES:n with One File Per Site.

Example 26. Simplified Use of MASTER_SITES:n with One File Per Site

    MASTER_SITES=    ftp://ftp1.example.com/:source1 \
            http://www.example.com/:source2
    DISTFILES=  source1.tar.gz:source1 \
            source2.tar.gz:source2

Multiple distribution files can have the same group. Continuing the
previous example, suppose that there was a third distfile,
source3.tar.gz, that is downloaded from ftp.example2.com. The Makefile
would then be written like Simplified Use of MASTER_SITES:n with More
Than One File Per Site.

Example 27. Simplified Use of MASTER_SITES:n with More Than One File Per
Site

    MASTER_SITES= ftp://ftp.example.com/:source1 \
            http://www.example.com/:source2
    DISTFILES=  source1.tar.gz:source1 \
            source2.tar.gz:source2 \
            source3.tar.gz:source2

5.4.9.2. Detailed Information

Okay, so the previous example did not reflect the new port’s needs? In
this section we will explain in detail how the fine grained fetching
mechanism MASTER_SITES:n works and how it can be used.

1.  Elements can be postfixed with :n where n is
    `, that is, _n_ could conceptually be any alphanumeric string but we will limit it to `[a-zA-Z_][0-9a-zA-Z_]
    for now.

    Moreover, string matching is case sensitive; that is, n is different
    from N.

    However, these words cannot be used for postfixing purposes since
    they yield special meaning: default, all and ALL (they are used
    internally in item ii). Furthermore, DEFAULT is a special purpose
    word (check item 3).

2.  Elements postfixed with :n belong to the group n, :m belong to group
    m and so forth.

3.  Elements without a postfix are groupless, they all belong to the
    special group DEFAULT. Any elements postfixed with DEFAULT, is just
    being redundant unless an element belongs to both DEFAULT and other
    groups at the same time (check item 5).

    These examples are equivalent but the first one is preferred:

        MASTER_SITES=  alpha

        MASTER_SITES=   alpha:DEFAULT

4.  Groups are not exclusive, an element may belong to several different
    groups at the same time and a group can either have either several
    different elements or none at all.

5.  When an element belongs to several groups at the same time, use the
    comma operator (,).

    Instead of repeating it several times, each time with a different
    postfix, we can list several groups at once in a single postfix. For
    instance, :m,n,o marks an element that belongs to group m, n and o.

    All these examples are equivalent but the last one is preferred:

        MASTER_SITES=   alpha alpha:SOME_SITE

        MASTER_SITES=   alpha:DEFAULT alpha:SOME_SITE

        MASTER_SITES=   alpha:SOME_SITE,DEFAULT

        MASTER_SITES= alpha:DEFAULT,SOME_SITE

6.  All sites within a given group are sorted according to
    MASTER_SORT_AWK. All groups within MASTER_SITES and PATCH_SITES are
    sorted as well.

7.  Group semantics can be used in any of the variables MASTER_SITES,
    PATCH_SITES, MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR, PATCH_SITE_SUBDIR, DISTFILES, and
    PATCHFILES according to this syntax:

    a.  All MASTER_SITES, PATCH_SITES, MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR and
        PATCH_SITE_SUBDIR elements must be terminated with the forward
        slash / character. If any elements belong to any groups, the
        group postfix :n must come right after the terminator /. The
        MASTER_SITES:n mechanism relies on the existence of the
        terminator / to avoid confusing elements where a :n is a valid
        part of the element with occurrences where :n denotes group n.
        For compatibility purposes, since the / terminator was not
        required before in both MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR and PATCH_SITE_SUBDIR
        elements, if the postfix immediate preceding character is not a
        / then :n will be considered a valid part of the element instead
        of a group postfix even if an element is postfixed with :n. See
        both Detailed Use of MASTER_SITES:n in MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR and
        Detailed Use of MASTER_SITES:n with Comma Operator, Multiple
        Files, Multiple Sites and Multiple Subdirectories.

        Example 28. Detailed Use of MASTER_SITES:n in MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR

            MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR=  old:n new/:NEW

        -   Directories within group DEFAULT → old:n

        -   Directories within group NEW → new

        Example 29. Detailed Use of MASTER_SITES:n with Comma Operator,
        Multiple Files, Multiple Sites and Multiple Subdirectories

            MASTER_SITES=  http://site1/%SUBDIR%/ http://site2/:DEFAULT \
                    http://site3/:group3 http://site4/:group4 \
                    http://site5/:group5 http://site6/:group6 \
                    http://site7/:DEFAULT,group6 \
                    http://site8/%SUBDIR%/:group6,group7 \
                    http://site9/:group8
            DISTFILES=  file1 file2:DEFAULT file3:group3 \
                    file4:group4,group5,group6 file5:grouping \
                    file6:group7
            MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR= directory-trial:1 directory-n/:groupn \
                    directory-one/:group6,DEFAULT \
                    directory

        The previous example results in this fine grained fetching.
        Sites are listed in the exact order they will be used.

        -   file1 will be fetched from

            -   MASTER_SITE_OVERRIDE

            -   http://site1/directory-trial:1/

            -   http://site1/directory-one/

            -   http://site1/directory/

            -   http://site2/

            -   http://site7/

            -   MASTER_SITE_BACKUP

        -   file2 will be fetched exactly as file1 since they both
            belong to the same group

            -   MASTER_SITE_OVERRIDE

            -   http://site1/directory-trial:1/

            -   http://site1/directory-one/

            -   http://site1/directory/

            -   http://site2/

            -   http://site7/

            -   MASTER_SITE_BACKUP

        -   file3 will be fetched from

            -   MASTER_SITE_OVERRIDE

            -   http://site3/

            -   MASTER_SITE_BACKUP

        -   file4 will be fetched from

            -   MASTER_SITE_OVERRIDE

            -   http://site4/

            -   http://site5/

            -   http://site6/

            -   http://site7/

            -   http://site8/directory-one/

            -   MASTER_SITE_BACKUP

        -   file5 will be fetched from

            -   MASTER_SITE_OVERRIDE

            -   MASTER_SITE_BACKUP

        -   file6 will be fetched from

            -   MASTER_SITE_OVERRIDE

            -   http://site8/

            -   MASTER_SITE_BACKUP

8.  How do I group one of the special macros from bsd.sites.mk, for
    example, SourceForge (SF)?

    This has been simplified as much as possible. See Detailed Use of
    MASTER_SITES:n with SourceForge (SF).

    Example 30. Detailed Use of MASTER_SITES:n with SourceForge (SF)

        MASTER_SITES= http://site1/ SF/something/1.0:sourceforge,TEST
        DISTFILES=  something.tar.gz:sourceforge

    something.tar.gz will be fetched from all sites within SourceForge.

9.  How do I use this with PATCH*?

    All examples were done with MASTER* but they work exactly the same
    for PATCH* ones as can be seen in Simplified Use of MASTER_SITES:n
    with PATCH_SITES.

    Example 31. Simplified Use of MASTER_SITES:n with PATCH_SITES

        PATCH_SITES=   http://site1/ http://site2/:test
        PATCHFILES= patch1:test

5.4.9.3. What Does Change for Ports? What Does Not?

i.  All current ports remain the same. The MASTER_SITES:n feature code
    is only activated if there are elements postfixed with :n like
    elements according to the aforementioned syntax rules, especially as
    shown in item 7.

ii. The port targets remain the same: checksum, makesum, patch,
    configure, build, etc. With the obvious exceptions of do-fetch,
    fetch-list, master-sites and patch-sites.

    -   do-fetch: deploys the new grouping postfixed DISTFILES and
        PATCHFILES with their matching group elements within both
        MASTER_SITES and PATCH_SITES which use matching group elements
        within both MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR and PATCH_SITE_SUBDIR. Check
        Detailed Use of MASTER_SITES:n with Comma Operator, Multiple
        Files, Multiple Sites and Multiple Subdirectories.

    -   fetch-list: works like old fetch-list with the exception that it
        groups just like do-fetch.

    -   master-sites and patch-sites: (incompatible with older versions)
        only return the elements of group DEFAULT; in fact, they execute
        targets master-sites-default and patch-sites-default
        respectively.

        Furthermore, using target either master-sites-all or
        patch-sites-all is preferred to directly checking either
        MASTER_SITES or PATCH_SITES. Also, directly checking is not
        guaranteed to work in any future versions. Check item B for more
        information on these new port targets.

iii. New port targets

     a.  There are master-sites-n and patch-sites-n targets which will
         list the elements of the respective group n within MASTER_SITES
         and PATCH_SITES respectively. For instance, both
         master-sites-DEFAULT and patch-sites-DEFAULT will return the
         elements of group DEFAULT, master-sites-test and
         patch-sites-test of group test, and thereon.

     b.  There are new targets master-sites-all and patch-sites-all
         which do the work of the old master-sites and patch-sites ones.
         They return the elements of all groups as if they all belonged
         to the same group with the caveat that it lists as many
         MASTER_SITE_BACKUP and MASTER_SITE_OVERRIDE as there are groups
         defined within either DISTFILES or PATCHFILES; respectively for
         master-sites-all and patch-sites-all.

5.4.10. DIST_SUBDIR

Do not let the port clutter /usr/ports/distfiles. If the port requires a
lot of files to be fetched, or contains a file that has a name that
might conflict with other ports (for example, Makefile), set DIST_SUBDIR
to the name of the port (${PORTNAME} or ${PKGNAMEPREFIX}${PORTNAME} are
fine). This will change DISTDIR from the default /usr/ports/distfiles to
/usr/ports/distfiles/${DIST_SUBDIR}, and in effect puts everything that
is required for the port into that subdirectory.

It will also look at the subdirectory with the same name on the backup
master site at http://distcache.FreeBSD.org (Setting DISTDIR explicitly
in Makefile will not accomplish this, so please use DIST_SUBDIR.)

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | This does not affect MASTER_SITES |
|                                   | defined in the Makefile.          |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

5.5. MAINTAINER

Set your mail-address here. Please. :-)

Only a single address without the comment part is allowed as a
MAINTAINER value. The format used is user@hostname.domain. Please do not
include any descriptive text such as a real name in this entry. That
merely confuses the Ports infrastructure and most tools using it.

The maintainer is responsible for keeping the port up to date and making
sure that it works correctly. For a detailed description of the
responsibilities of a port maintainer, refer to The challenge for port
maintainers.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | A maintainer volunteers to keep a |

|                                   | Ports exist for the benefit of    |

|                                   | this means is that people other   |

|                                   | changes to a port. Large changes  |
|                                   | to the Ports Collection might     |
|                                   | require changes to many ports.    |

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Other changes to the port will be sent to the maintainer for review and
approval before being committed. If the maintainer does not respond to
an update request after two weeks (excluding major public holidays),
then that is considered a maintainer timeout, and the update can be made
without explicit maintainer approval. If the maintainer does not respond
within three months, or if there have been three consecutive timeouts,
then that maintainer is considered absent without leave, and all of
their ports can be assigned back to the pool. Exceptions to this are
anything maintained by the Ports Management Team <portmgr@FreeBSD.org>,
or the Security Officer Team <security-officer@FreeBSD.org>. No
unauthorized commits may ever be made to ports maintained by those
groups.

We reserve the right to modify the maintainer’s submission to better
match existing policies and style of the Ports Collection without
explicit blessing from the submitter or the maintainer. Also, large
infrastructural changes can result in a port being modified without the
maintainer’s consent. These kinds of changes will never affect the
port’s functionality.

The Ports Management Team <portmgr@FreeBSD.org> reserves the right to
revoke or override anyone’s maintainership for any reason, and the
Security Officer Team <security-officer@FreeBSD.org> reserves the right
to revoke or override maintainership for security reasons.

5.6. COMMENT

The comment is a one-line description of a port shown by pkg info.
Please follow these rules when composing it:

1.  The COMMENT string should be 70 characters or less.

2.  Do not include the package name or version number of software.

3.  The comment must begin with a capital and end without a period.

4.  Do not start with an indefinite article (that is, A or An).

5.  Capitalize names such as Apache, JavaScript, or Perl.

6.  Use a serial comma for lists of words: "green, red, and blue."

7.  Check for spelling errors.

Here is an example:

    COMMENT= Cat chasing a mouse all over the screen

The COMMENT variable immediately follows the MAINTAINER variable in the
Makefile.

5.7. Project website

Each port should point to a website that provides more information about
the software.

Whenever possible, this should be the official project website
maintained by the developers of the software.

    WWW=      https://ffmpeg.org/

But it can also be a directory or resource in the source code
repository:

    WWW=       https://sourceforge.net/projects/mpd/

The WWW variable immediately follows the COMMENT variable in the
Makefile.

If the same content can be accessed via HTTP and HTTPS, the URL starting
with https:// shall be used. If the URI is the root of the website or
directory, it must be terminated with a slash.

This information used to be placed into the last line of the pkg-descr
file. It has been moved into the Makefile for easier maintenance and
processing. Having a WWW: line at the end of the pkg-descr file is
deprecated.

5.8. Licenses

Each port must document the license under which it is available. If it
is not an OSI approved license it must also document any restrictions on
redistribution.

5.8.1. LICENSE

A short name for the license or licenses if more than one license apply.

If it is one of the licenses listed in Predefined License List, only
LICENSE_FILE and LICENSE_DISTFILES variables can be set.

If this is a license that has not been defined in the ports framework
(see Predefined License List), the LICENSE_PERMS and LICENSE_NAME must
be set, along with either LICENSE_FILE or LICENSE_TEXT.
LICENSE_DISTFILES and LICENSE_GROUPS can also be set, but are not
required.

The predefined licenses are shown in Predefined License List. The
current list is always available in Mk/bsd.licenses.db.mk.

Example 32. Simplest Usage, Predefined Licenses

When the README of some software says "This software is under the terms
of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free
Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your
option) any later version." but does not provide the license file, use
this:

    LICENSE=  LGPL21+

When the software provides the license file, use this:

    LICENSE=  LGPL21+
    LICENSE_FILE=   ${WRKSRC}/COPYING

For the predefined licenses, the default permissions are
dist-mirror dist-sell pkg-mirror pkg-sell auto-accept.

Permissions. use none if empty.

License Permissions List

dist-mirror

    Redistribution of the distribution files is permitted. The
    distribution files will be added to the FreeBSD MASTER_SITE_BACKUP
    CDN.

no-dist-mirror

    Redistribution of the distribution files is prohibited. This is
    equivalent to setting RESTRICTED. The distribution files will not be
    added to the FreeBSD MASTER_SITE_BACKUP CDN.

dist-sell

    Selling of distribution files is permitted. The distribution files
    will be present on the installer images.

no-dist-sell

    Selling of distribution files is prohibited. This is equivalent to
    setting NO_CDROM.

pkg-mirror

    Free redistribution of package is permitted. The package will be
    distributed on the FreeBSD package CDN https://pkg.freebsd.org/.

no-pkg-mirror

    Free redistribution of package is prohibited. Equivalent to setting
    NO_PACKAGE. The package will not be distributed from the FreeBSD
    package CDN https://pkg.freebsd.org/.

pkg-sell

    Selling of package is permitted. The package will be present on the
    installer images.

no-pkg-sell

    Selling of package is prohibited. This is equivalent to setting
    NO_CDROM. The package will not be present on the installer images.

auto-accept

    License is accepted by default. Prompts to accept a license are not
    displayed unless the user has defined LICENSES_ASK. Use this unless
    the license states the user must accept the terms of the license.

no-auto-accept

    License is not accepted by default. The user will always be asked to
    confirm the acceptance of this license. This must be used if the
    license states that the user must accept its terms.

When both permission and no-permission is present the no-permission will
cancel permission.

When permission is not present, it is considered to be a no-permission.

|                                   | prevent a port (and all ports     |
|                                   | depending on it) from being       |
|                                   | usable by package users:          |

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Example 33. Nonstandard License

Read the terms of the license and translate those using the available
permissions.

    LICENSE=        UNKNOWN
    LICENSE_NAME=   unknown
    LICENSE_TEXT=   This program is NOT in public domain.\
                    It can be freely distributed for non-commercial purposes only.
    LICENSE_PERMS=  dist-mirror no-dist-sell pkg-mirror no-pkg-sell auto-accept

Example 34. Standard and Nonstandard Licenses

Read the terms of the license and express those using the available
permissions. In case of doubt, please ask for guidance on the FreeBSD
ports mailing list.

    LICENSE=        WARSOW GPLv2
    LICENSE_COMB=   multi
    LICENSE_NAME_WARSOW=    Warsow Content License
    LICENSE_FILE_WARSOW=    ${WRKSRC}/docs/license.txt
    LICENSE_PERMS_WARSOW=   dist-mirror pkg-mirror auto-accept

When the permissions of the GPLv2 and the UNKNOWN licenses are mixed,
the port ends up with
dist-mirror dist-sell pkg-mirror pkg-sell auto-accept dist-mirror no-dist-sell pkg-mirror no-pkg-sell auto-accept.
The no-permissions cancel the permissions. The resulting list of
permissions are dist-mirror pkg-mirror auto-accept. The distribution
files and the packages will not be available on the installer images.

5.8.3. LICENSE_GROUPS and LICENSE_GROUPS_NAME

Groups the license belongs.

Predefined License Groups List

FSF

    Free Software Foundation Approved, see the FSF Licensing &
    Compliance Team.

GPL

    GPL Compatible

OSI

    OSI Approved, see the Open Source Initiative Open Source Licenses
    page.

COPYFREE

    Comply with Copyfree Standard Definition, see the Copyfree Licenses
    page.

FONTS

    Font licenses

5.8.4. LICENSE_NAME and LICENSE_NAME_NAME

Full name of the license.

Example 35. LICENSE_NAME

    LICENSE=        UNRAR
    LICENSE_NAME=   UnRAR License
    LICENSE_FILE=   ${WRKSRC}/license.txt
    LICENSE_PERMS=  dist-mirror dist-sell pkg-mirror pkg-sell auto-accept

5.8.5. LICENSE_FILE and LICENSE_FILE_NAME

Full path to the file containing the license text, usually
${WRKSRC}/some/file. If the file is not in the distfile, and its content
is too long to be put in LICENSE_TEXT, put it in a new file in
${FILESDIR}.

Example 36. LICENSE_FILE

    LICENSE=  GPLv3+
    LICENSE_FILE=   ${WRKSRC}/COPYING

5.8.6. LICENSE_TEXT and LICENSE_TEXT_NAME

Text to use as a license. Useful when the license is not in the
distribution files and its text is short.

Example 37. LICENSE_TEXT

    LICENSE=        UNKNOWN
    LICENSE_NAME=   unknown
    LICENSE_TEXT=   This program is NOT in public domain.\
                    It can be freely distributed for non-commercial purposes only,\
                    and THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THIS PROGRAM.
    LICENSE_PERMS=  dist-mirror no-dist-sell pkg-mirror no-pkg-sell auto-accept

5.8.7. LICENSE_DISTFILES and LICENSE_DISTFILES_NAME

The distribution files to which the licenses apply. Defaults to all the
distribution files.

Example 38. LICENSE_DISTFILES

Used when the distribution files do not all have the same license. For
example, one has a code license, and another has some artwork that
cannot be redistributed:

    MASTER_SITES=   SF/some-game
    DISTFILES=      ${DISTNAME}${EXTRACT_SUFX} artwork.zip

    LICENSE=        BSD3CLAUSE ARTWORK
    LICENSE_COMB=   dual
    LICENSE_NAME_ARTWORK=      The game artwork license
    LICENSE_TEXT_ARTWORK=      The README says that the files cannot be redistributed
    LICENSE_PERMS_ARTWORK=     pkg-mirror pkg-sell auto-accept
    LICENSE_DISTFILES_BSD3CLAUSE=   ${DISTNAME}${EXTRACT_SUFX}
    LICENSE_DISTFILES_ARTWORK= artwork.zip

5.8.8. LICENSE_COMB

Set to multi if all licenses apply. Set to dual if any license applies.
Defaults to single.

Example 39. Dual Licenses

When a port says "This software may be distributed under the GNU General
Public License or the Artistic License", it means that either license
can be used. Use this:

    LICENSE=    ART10 GPLv1
    LICENSE_COMB=   dual

If license files are provided, use this:

    LICENSE=   ART10 GPLv1
    LICENSE_COMB=   dual
    LICENSE_FILE_ART10=     ${WRKSRC}/Artistic
    LICENSE_FILE_GPLv1=     ${WRKSRC}/Copying

Example 40. Multiple Licenses

When part of a port has one license, and another part has a different
license, use multi:

    LICENSE=    GPLv2 LGPL21+
    LICENSE_COMB=   multi

5.9. PORTSCOUT

Portscout is an automated distfile check utility for the FreeBSD Ports
Collection, described in detail in Portscout: the FreeBSD Ports Distfile
Scanner.

PORTSCOUT defines special conditions within which the Portscout distfile
scanner is restricted.

Situations where PORTSCOUT is set include:

-   When distfiles have to be ignored for specific versions. For
    example, to exclude version 8.2 and version 8.3 from distfile
    version checks because they are known to be broken, add:

        PORTSCOUT= skipv:8.2,8.3

-   When distfile version checks have to be disabled completely. For
    example, if a port is not going to be updated ever again, add:

        PORTSCOUT=   ignore:1

-   When specific versions or specific major and minor revisions of a
    distfile must be checked. For example, if only version 0.6.4 must be
    monitored because newer versions have compatibility issues with
    FreeBSD, add:

        PORTSCOUT=  limit:^0\.6\.4

-   When URLs listing the available versions differ from the download
    URLs. For example, to limit distfile version checks to the download
    page for the databases/pgtune port, add:

        PORTSCOUT=   site:http://www.renpy.org/dl/release/

5.10. Dependencies

Many ports depend on other ports. This is a very convenient feature of
most Unix-like operating systems, including FreeBSD. Multiple ports can
share a common dependency, rather than bundling that dependency with
every port or package that needs it. There are seven variables that can
be used to ensure that all the required bits will be on the user’s
machine. There are also some pre-supported dependency variables for
common cases, plus a few more to control the behavior of dependencies.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | When software has extra           |
|                                   | dependencies that provide extra   |
|                                   | features, the base dependencies   |
|                                   | listed in *_DEPENDS should        |
|                                   | include the extra dependencies    |
|                                   | that would benefit most users.    |
|                                   | The base dependencies should      |
|                                   | never be a "minimal" dependency   |
|                                   | set. The goal is not to include   |
|                                   | every dependency possible. Only   |
|                                   | include those that will benefit   |
|                                   | most people.                      |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

5.10.1. LIB_DEPENDS

This variable specifies the shared libraries this port depends on. It is
a list of lib:dir tuples where lib is the name of the shared library,
dir is the directory in which to find it in case it is not available.
For example,

    LIB_DEPENDS=   libjpeg.so:graphics/jpeg

will check for a shared jpeg library with any version, and descend into
the graphics/jpeg subdirectory of the ports tree to build and install it
if it is not found.

The dependency is checked twice, once from within the build target and
then from within the install target. Also, the name of the dependency is
put into the package so that pkg install (see pkg-install(8)) will
automatically install it if it is not on the user’s system.

5.10.2. RUN_DEPENDS

This variable specifies executables or files this port depends on during
run-time. It is a list of path:dir[:target] tuples where path is the
name of the executable or file, dir is the directory in which to find it
in case it is not available, and target is the target to call in that
directory. If path starts with a slash (/), it is treated as a file and
its existence is tested with test -e; otherwise, it is assumed to be an
executable, and which -s is used to determine if the program exists in
the search path.

For example,

    RUN_DEPENDS=   ${LOCALBASE}/news/bin/innd:news/inn \
            xmlcatmgr:textproc/xmlcatmgr

will check if the file or directory /usr/local/news/bin/innd exists, and
build and install it from the news/inn subdirectory of the ports tree if
it is not found. It will also see if an executable called xmlcatmgr is
in the search path, and descend into textproc/xmlcatmgr to build and
install it if it is not found.

|                                   | In this case, innd is actually an |
|                                   | executable; if an executable is   |

|                                   | the ports build cluster is        |

|                                   | in:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

The dependency is checked from within the install target. Also, the name
of the dependency is put into the package so that pkg install (see
pkg-install(8)) will automatically install it if it is not on the user’s
system. The target part can be omitted if it is the same as
DEPENDS_TARGET.

A quite common situation is when RUN_DEPENDS is literally the same as
BUILD_DEPENDS, especially if ported software is written in a scripted
language or if it requires the same build and run-time environment. In
this case, it is both tempting and intuitive to directly assign one to
the other:

    RUN_DEPENDS= ${BUILD_DEPENDS}

However, such assignment can pollute run-time dependencies with entries
not defined in the port’s original BUILD_DEPENDS. This happens because
of make(1)'s lazy evaluation of variable assignment. Consider a Makefile
with USE_*, which are processed by ports/Mk/bsd.*.mk to augment initial
build dependencies. For example, USES= gmake adds devel/gmake to
BUILD_DEPENDS. To prevent such additional dependencies from polluting
RUN_DEPENDS, create another variable with the current content of
BUILD_DEPENDS and assign it to both BUILD_DEPENDS and RUN_DEPENDS:

    MY_DEPENDS=    some:devel/some \
            other:lang/other
    BUILD_DEPENDS=  ${MY_DEPENDS}
    RUN_DEPENDS=    ${MY_DEPENDS}

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Do not use := to assign           |
|                                   | BUILD_DEPENDS to RUN_DEPENDS or   |
|                                   | vice-versa. All variables are     |
|                                   | expanded immediately, which is    |
|                                   | exactly the wrong thing to do and |
|                                   | almost always a failure.          |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

5.10.3. BUILD_DEPENDS

This variable specifies executables or files this port requires to
build. Like RUN_DEPENDS, it is a list of path:dir[:target] tuples. For
example,

    BUILD_DEPENDS=   unzip:archivers/unzip

will check for an executable called unzip, and descend into the
archivers/unzip subdirectory of the ports tree to build and install it
if it is not found.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | "build" here means everything     |
|                                   | from extraction to compilation.   |
|                                   | The dependency is checked from    |
|                                   | within the extract target. The    |
|                                   | target part can be omitted if it  |
|                                   | is the same as DEPENDS_TARGET     |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

5.10.4. FETCH_DEPENDS

This variable specifies executables or files this port requires to
fetch. Like the previous two, it is a list of path:dir[:target] tuples.
For example,

    FETCH_DEPENDS=   ncftp2:net/ncftp2

will check for an executable called ncftp2, and descend into the
net/ncftp2 subdirectory of the ports tree to build and install it if it
is not found.

The dependency is checked from within the fetch target. The target part
can be omitted if it is the same as DEPENDS_TARGET.

5.10.5. EXTRACT_DEPENDS

This variable specifies executables or files this port requires for
extraction. Like the previous, it is a list of path:dir[:target] tuples.
For example,

    EXTRACT_DEPENDS= unzip:archivers/unzip

will check for an executable called unzip, and descend into the
archivers/unzip subdirectory of the ports tree to build and install it
if it is not found.

The dependency is checked from within the extract target. The target
part can be omitted if it is the same as DEPENDS_TARGET.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Use this variable only if the     |
|                                   | extraction does not already work  |
|                                   | (the default assumes tar) and     |
|                                   | cannot be made to work using      |
|                                   | USES=tar, USES=lha or USES=zip    |
|                                   | described in Using USES Macros.   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

5.10.6. PATCH_DEPENDS

This variable specifies executables or files this port requires to
patch. Like the previous, it is a list of path:dir[:target] tuples. For
example,

    PATCH_DEPENDS=  ${NONEXISTENT}:java/jfc:extract

will descend into the java/jfc subdirectory of the ports tree to extract
it.

The dependency is checked from within the patch target. The target part
can be omitted if it is the same as DEPENDS_TARGET.

5.10.7. USES

Parameters can be added to define different features and dependencies
used by the port. They are specified by adding this line to the
Makefile:

    USES= feature[:arguments]

For the complete list of values, please see Using USES Macros.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | USES cannot be assigned after     |
|                                   | inclusion of bsd.port.pre.mk.     |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

5.10.8. USE_*

Several variables exist to define common dependencies shared by many
ports. Their use is optional, but helps to reduce the verbosity of the
port Makefiles. Each of them is styled as USE_*. These variables may be
used only in the port Makefiles and ports/Mk/bsd.*.mk. They are not
meant for user-settable options - use PORT_OPTIONS for that purpose.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | It is always incorrect to set any |
|                                   | USE_* in /etc/make.conf. For      |
|                                   | instance, setting                 |

|                                   |     USE_GCC=X.Y                   |

|                                   | (where X.Y is version number)     |
|                                   | would add a dependency on gccXY   |
|                                   | for every port, including         |
|                                   | lang/gccXY itself!                |

|                                   | require modern, recent versions.  |

5.10.9. Minimal Version of a Dependency

A minimal version of a dependency can be specified in any *_DEPENDS
except LIB_DEPENDS using this syntax:

    p5-Spiffy>=0.26:devel/p5-Spiffy

The first field contains a dependent package name, which must match the
entry in the package database, a comparison sign, and a package version.
The dependency is satisfied if p5-Spiffy-0.26 or newer is installed on
the machine.

5.10.10. Notes on Dependencies

As mentioned above, the default target to call when a dependency is
required is DEPENDS_TARGET. It defaults to install. This is a user
variable; it is never defined in a port’s Makefile. If the port needs a
special way to handle a dependency, use the :target part of *_DEPENDS
instead of redefining DEPENDS_TARGET.

When running make clean, the port dependencies are automatically cleaned
too. If this is not desirable, define NOCLEANDEPENDS in the environment.
This may be particularly desirable if the port has something that takes
a long time to rebuild in its dependency list, such as KDE, GNOME or
Mozilla.

To depend on another port unconditionally, use the variable
${NONEXISTENT} as the first field of BUILD_DEPENDS or RUN_DEPENDS. Use
this only when the source of the other port is needed. Compilation time
can be saved by specifying the target too. For instance

    BUILD_DEPENDS=   ${NONEXISTENT}:graphics/jpeg:extract

will always descend to the jpeg port and extract it.

5.10.11. Circular Dependencies Are Fatal

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Do not introduce any circular     |
|                                   | dependencies into the ports tree! |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

The ports building technology does not tolerate circular dependencies.
If one is introduced, someone, somewhere in the world, will have their
FreeBSD installation broken almost immediately, with many others quickly
to follow. These can really be hard to detect. If in doubt, before
making that change, make sure to run: cd /usr/ports; make index. That
process can be quite slow on older machines, but it may be able to save
a large number of people, including yourself, a lot of grief in the
process.

5.10.12. Problems Caused by Automatic Dependencies

Dependencies must be declared either explicitly or by using the OPTIONS
framework. Using other methods like automatic detection complicates
indexing, which causes problems for port and package management.

Example 41. Wrong Declaration of an Optional Dependency

    .include <bsd.port.pre.mk>

    .if exists(${LOCALBASE}/bin/foo)
    LIB_DEPENDS=    libbar.so:foo/bar
    .endif

The problem with trying to automatically add dependencies is that files
and settings outside an individual port can change at any time. For
example: an index is built, then a batch of ports are installed. But one
of the ports installs the tested file. The index is now incorrect,
because an installed port unexpectedly has a new dependency. The index
may still be wrong even after rebuilding if other ports also determine
their need for dependencies based on the existence of other files.

Example 42. Correct Declaration of an Optional Dependency

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=    BAR
    BAR_DESC=   Calling cellphones via bar

    BAR_LIB_DEPENDS=    libbar.so:foo/bar

Testing option variables is the correct method. It will not cause
inconsistencies in the index of a batch of ports, provided the options
were defined prior to the index build. Simple scripts can then be used
to automate the building, installation, and updating of these ports and
their packages.

5.11. Slave Ports and MASTERDIR

If the port needs to build slightly different versions of packages by
having a variable (for instance, resolution, or paper size) take
different values, create one subdirectory per package to make it easier
for users to see what to do, but try to share as many files as possible
between ports. Typically, by using variables cleverly, only a very short
Makefile is needed in all but one of the directories. In the sole
Makefile, use MASTERDIR to specify the directory where the rest of the
files are. Also, use a variable as part of PKGNAMESUFFIX so the packages
will have different names.

This will be best demonstrated by an example. This is part of
print/pkfonts300/Makefile;

    PORTNAME=  pkfonts${RESOLUTION}
    PORTVERSION=    1.0
    DISTFILES=  pk${RESOLUTION}.tar.gz

    PLIST=      ${PKGDIR}/pkg-plist.${RESOLUTION}

    .if !defined(RESOLUTION)
    RESOLUTION= 300
    .else
    .if ${RESOLUTION} != 118 && ${RESOLUTION} != 240 && \
        ${RESOLUTION} != 300 && ${RESOLUTION} != 360 && \
        ${RESOLUTION} != 400 && ${RESOLUTION} != 600
    .BEGIN:
        @${ECHO_MSG} "Error: invalid value for RESOLUTION: \"${RESOLUTION}\""
        @${ECHO_MSG} "Possible values are: 118, 240, 300, 360, 400 and 600."
        @${FALSE}
    .endif
    .endif

print/pkfonts300 also has all the regular patches, package files, etc.
Running make there, it will take the default value for the resolution
(300) and build the port normally.

As for other resolutions, this is the entire print/pkfonts360/Makefile:

    RESOLUTION=   360
    MASTERDIR=  ${.CURDIR}/../pkfonts300

    .include    "${MASTERDIR}/Makefile"

(print/pkfonts118/Makefile, print/pkfonts600/Makefile, and all the other
are similar). MASTERDIR definition tells bsd.port.mk that the regular
set of subdirectories like FILESDIR and SCRIPTDIR are to be found under
pkfonts300. The RESOLUTION=360 line will override the RESOLUTION=300
line in pkfonts300/Makefile and the port will be built with resolution
set to 360.

5.12. Man Pages

If the port anchors its man tree somewhere other than PREFIX, use
MANDIRS to specify those directories. Note that the files corresponding
to manual pages must be placed in pkg-plist along with the rest of the
files. The purpose of MANDIRS is to enable automatic compression of
manual pages, therefore the file names are suffixed with .gz.

5.13. Info Files

If the package needs to install GNU info files, list them in INFO
(without the trailing .info), one entry per document. These files are
assumed to be installed to PREFIX/INFO_PATH. Change INFO_PATH if the
package uses a different location. However, this is not recommended.
These entries contain just the path relative to PREFIX/INFO_PATH. For
example, lang/gcc34 installs info files to PREFIX/INFO_PATH/gcc34, and
INFO will be something like this:

    INFO= gcc34/cpp gcc34/cppinternals gcc34/g77 ...

Appropriate installation/de-installation code will be automatically
added to the temporary pkg-plist before package registration.

5.14. Makefile Options

Many applications can be built with optional or differing
configurations. Examples include choice of natural (human) language, GUI
versus command-line, or type of database to support. Users may need a
different configuration than the default, so the ports system provides
hooks the port author can use to control which variant will be built.
Supporting these options properly will make users happy, and effectively
provide two or more ports for the price of one.

5.14.1. OPTIONS

5.14.1.1. Background

OPTIONS_* give the user installing the port a dialog showing the
available options, and then saves those options to
${PORT_DBDIR}/${OPTIONS_NAME}/options. The next time the port is built,
the options are reused. PORT_DBDIR defaults to /var/db/ports.
OPTIONS_NAME is to the port origin with an underscore as the space
separator, for example, for dns/bind99 it will be dns_bind99.

When the user runs make config (or runs make build for the first time),
the framework checks for ${PORT_DBDIR}/${OPTIONS_NAME}/options. If that
file does not exist, the values of OPTIONS_* are used, and a dialog box
is displayed where the options can be enabled or disabled. Then options
is saved and the configured variables are used when building the port.

If a new version of the port adds new OPTIONS, the dialog will be
presented to the user with the saved values of old OPTIONS prefilled.

make showconfig shows the saved configuration. Use make rmconfig to
remove the saved configuration.

5.14.1.2. Syntax

OPTIONS_DEFINE contains a list of OPTIONS to be used. These are
independent of each other and are not grouped:

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=  OPT1 OPT2

Once defined, OPTIONS are described (optional, but strongly
recommended):

    OPT1_DESC=  Describe OPT1
    OPT2_DESC=  Describe OPT2
    OPT3_DESC=  Describe OPT3
    OPT4_DESC=  Describe OPT4
    OPT5_DESC=  Describe OPT5
    OPT6_DESC=  Describe OPT6

ports/Mk/bsd.options.desc.mk has descriptions for many common OPTIONS.
While often useful, override them if the description is insufficient for
the port.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | When describing options, view it  |
|                                   | from the perspective of the user: |
|                                   | "What functionality does it       |
|                                   | change?" and "Why would I want to |
|                                   | enable this?" Do not just repeat  |
|                                   | the name. For example, describing |
|                                   | the NLS option as "include NLS    |
|                                   | support" does not help the user,  |
|                                   | who can already see the option    |
|                                   | name but may not know what it     |
|                                   | means. Describing it as "Native   |
|                                   | Language Support via gettext      |
|                                   | utilities" is much more helpful.  |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Option names are always in all    |
|                                   | uppercase. They cannot use mixed  |
|                                   | case or lowercase.                |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

OPTIONS can be grouped as radio choices, where only one choice from each
group is allowed:

    OPTIONS_SINGLE=     SG1
    OPTIONS_SINGLE_SG1= OPT3 OPT4

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | There must be one of each         |
|                                   | OPTIONS_SINGLE group selected at  |
|                                   | all times for the options to be   |
|                                   | valid. One option of each group   |
|                                   | must be added to OPTIONS_DEFAULT. |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

OPTIONS can be grouped as radio choices, where none or only one choice
from each group is allowed:

    OPTIONS_RADIO=      RG1
    OPTIONS_RADIO_RG1=  OPT7 OPT8

OPTIONS can also be grouped as "multiple-choice" lists, where at least
one option must be enabled:

    OPTIONS_MULTI=        MG1
    OPTIONS_MULTI_MG1=  OPT5 OPT6

OPTIONS can also be grouped as "multiple-choice" lists, where none or
any option can be enabled:

    OPTIONS_GROUP=       GG1
    OPTIONS_GROUP_GG1=  OPT9 OPT10

OPTIONS are unset by default, unless they are listed in OPTIONS_DEFAULT:

    OPTIONS_DEFAULT=   OPT1 OPT3 OPT6

OPTIONS definitions must appear before the inclusion of
bsd.port.options.mk. PORT_OPTIONS values can only be tested after the
inclusion of bsd.port.options.mk. Inclusion of bsd.port.pre.mk can be
used instead, too, and is still widely used in ports written before the
introduction of bsd.port.options.mk. But be aware that some variables
will not work as expected after the inclusion of bsd.port.pre.mk,
typically some USE_* flags.

Example 43. Simple Use of OPTIONS

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=   FOO BAR
    OPTIONS_DEFAULT=FOO

    FOO_DESC=   Option foo support
    BAR_DESC=   Feature bar support

    # Will add --with-foo / --without-foo
    FOO_CONFIGURE_WITH= foo
    BAR_RUN_DEPENDS=    bar:bar/bar

    .include <bsd.port.mk>

Example 44. Check for Unset Port OPTIONS

    .if ! ${PORT_OPTIONS:MEXAMPLES}
    CONFIGURE_ARGS+=--without-examples
    .endif

The form shown above is discouraged. The preferred method is using a
configure knob to really enable and disable the feature to match the
option:

    # Will add --with-examples / --without-examples
    EXAMPLES_CONFIGURE_WITH=    examples

Example 45. Practical Use of OPTIONS

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=        EXAMPLES
    OPTIONS_DEFAULT=    PGSQL LDAP SSL

    OPTIONS_SINGLE=     BACKEND
    OPTIONS_SINGLE_BACKEND= MYSQL PGSQL BDB

    OPTIONS_MULTI=      AUTH
    OPTIONS_MULTI_AUTH= LDAP PAM SSL

    EXAMPLES_DESC=      Install extra examples
    MYSQL_DESC=     Use MySQL as backend
    PGSQL_DESC=     Use PostgreSQL as backend
    BDB_DESC=       Use Berkeley DB as backend
    LDAP_DESC=      Build with LDAP authentication support
    PAM_DESC=       Build with PAM support
    SSL_DESC=       Build with OpenSSL support

    # Will add USE_PGSQL=yes
    PGSQL_USE=  pgsql=yes
    # Will add --enable-postgres / --disable-postgres
    PGSQL_CONFIGURE_ENABLE= postgres

    ICU_LIB_DEPENDS=    libicuuc.so:devel/icu

    # Will add --with-examples / --without-examples
    EXAMPLES_CONFIGURE_WITH=    examples

    # Check other OPTIONS

    .include <bsd.port.mk>

5.14.1.3. Default Options

These options are always on by default.

-   DOCS - build and install documentation.

-   NLS - Native Language Support.

-   EXAMPLES - build and install examples.

-   IPV6 - IPv6 protocol support.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | There is no need to add these to  |
|                                   | OPTIONS_DEFAULT. To have them     |
|                                   | active, and show up in the        |
|                                   | options selection dialog,         |
|                                   | however, they must be added to    |
|                                   | OPTIONS_DEFINE.                   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

5.14.2. Feature Auto-Activation

When using a GNU configure script, keep an eye on which optional
features are activated by auto-detection. Explicitly disable optional
features that are not needed by adding --without-xxx or --disable-xxx in
CONFIGURE_ARGS.

Example 46. Wrong Handling of an Option

    .if ${PORT_OPTIONS:MFOO}
    LIB_DEPENDS+=       libfoo.so:devel/foo
    CONFIGURE_ARGS+=    --enable-foo
    .endif

In the example above, imagine a library libfoo is installed on the
system. The user does not want this application to use libfoo, so he
toggled the option off in the make config dialog. But the application’s
configure script detects the library present in the system and includes
its support in the resulting executable. Now when the user decides to
remove libfoo from the system, the ports system does not protest (no
dependency on libfoo was recorded) but the application breaks.

Example 47. Correct Handling of an Option

    FOO_LIB_DEPENDS=     libfoo.so:devel/foo
    # Will add --enable-foo / --disable-foo
    FOO_CONFIGURE_ENABLE=   foo

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Under some circumstances, the     |
|                                   | shorthand conditional syntax can  |
|                                   | cause problems with complex       |
|                                   | constructs. The errors are        |
|                                   | usually Malformed conditional, an |
|                                   | alternative syntax can be used.   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   |     .if !empty(VARIABLE:MVALUE)   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | as an alternative to              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   |     .if ${VARIABLE:MVALUE}        |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

5.14.3. Options Helpers

There are some macros to help simplify conditional values which differ
based on the options set. For easier access, a comprehensive list is
provided:

PLIST_SUB, SUB_LIST

    For automatic %%OPT%% and %%NOOPT%% generation, see OPTIONS_SUB.

    For more complex usage, see Generic Variables Replacement,
    OPT_VARIABLE and OPT_VARIABLE_OFF.

CONFIGURE_ARGS

    For --enable-x and --disable-x, see OPT_CONFIGURE_ENABLE.

    For --with-x and --without-x, see OPT_CONFIGURE_WITH.

    For all other cases, see OPT_CONFIGURE_ON and OPT_CONFIGURE_OFF.

CMAKE_ARGS

    For arguments that are booleans (on, off, true, false, 0, 1) see
    OPT_CMAKE_BOOL and OPT_CMAKE_BOOL_OFF.

    For all other cases, see OPT_CMAKE_ON and OPT_CMAKE_OFF.

MESON_ARGS

    For arguments that take true or false, see OPT_MESON_TRUE and
    OPT_MESON_FALSE.

    For arguments that take yes or no, use OPT_MESON_YES and
    OPT_MESON_NO.

    For arguments that take enabled or disabled, see OPT_MESON_ENABLED
    and OPT_MESON_DISABLED.

    For all other cases, use OPT_MESON_ON and OPT_MESON_OFF.

QMAKE_ARGS

    See OPT_QMAKE_ON and OPT_QMAKE_OFF.

USE_*

    See OPT_USE and OPT_USE_OFF.

*_DEPENDS

    See Dependencies, OPT_DEPTYPE and OPT_DEPTYPE_OFF.

* (Any variable)

    The most used variables have direct helpers, see Generic Variables
    Replacement, OPT_VARIABLE and OPT_VARIABLE_OFF.

    For any variable without a specific helper, see OPT_VARS and
    OPT_VARS_OFF.

Options dependencies

    When an option need another option to work, see OPT_IMPLIES.

Options conflicts

    When an option cannot work if another is also enabled, see
    OPT_PREVENTS and OPT_PREVENTS_MSG.

Build targets

    When an option need some extra processing, see Additional Build
    Targets, target-OPT-on and target-OPT-off.

5.14.3.1. OPTIONS_SUB

If OPTIONS_SUB is set to yes then each of the options added to
OPTIONS_DEFINE will be added to PLIST_SUB and SUB_LIST, for example:

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=    OPT1
    OPTIONS_SUB=    yes

is equivalent to:

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=    OPT1

    .include <bsd.port.options.mk>

    .if ${PORT_OPTIONS:MOPT1}
    PLIST_SUB+= OPT1="" NO_OPT1="@comment "
    SUB_LIST+=  OPT1="" NO_OPT1="@comment "
    .else
    PLIST_SUB+= OPT1="@comment " NO_OPT1=""
    SUB_LIST+=  OPT1="@comment " NO_OPT1=""
    .endif

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | The value of OPTIONS_SUB is       |
|                                   | ignored. Setting it to any value  |
|                                   | will add PLIST_SUB and SUB_LIST   |
|                                   | entries for all options.          |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

5.14.3.2. OPT_USE and OPT_USE_OFF

When option OPT is selected, for each key=value pair in OPT_USE, value
is appended to the corresponding USE_KEY. If value has spaces in it,
replace them with commas and they will be changed back to spaces during
processing. OPT_USE_OFF works the same way, but when OPT is not
selected. For example:

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=  OPT1
    OPT1_USES=  xorg
    OPT1_USE=   mysql=yes xorg=x11,xextproto,xext,xrandr
    OPT1_USE_OFF=   openssl=yes

is equivalent to:

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=    OPT1

    .include <bsd.port.options.mk>

    .if ${PORT_OPTIONS:MOPT1}
    USE_MYSQL=  yes
    USES+=      xorg
    USE_XORG=   x11 xextproto xext xrandr
    .else
    USE_OPENSSL=    yes
    .endif

5.14.3.3. CONFIGURE_ARGS Helpers

5.14.3.3.1. OPT_CONFIGURE_ENABLE

When option OPT is selected, for each entry in OPT_CONFIGURE_ENABLE then
--enable-entry is appended to CONFIGURE_ARGS. When option OPT is not
selected, --disable-entry is appended to CONFIGURE_ARGS. An optional
argument can be specified with an = symbol. This argument is only
appended to the --enable-entry configure option. For example:

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=  OPT1 OPT2
    OPT1_CONFIGURE_ENABLE=  test1 test2
    OPT2_CONFIGURE_ENABLE=  test2=exhaustive

is equivalent to:

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=   OPT1

    .include <bsd.port.options.mk>

    .if ${PORT_OPTIONS:MOPT1}
    CONFIGURE_ARGS+=    --enable-test1 --enable-test2
    .else
    CONFIGURE_ARGS+=    --disable-test1 --disable-test2
    .endif

    .if ${PORT_OPTIONS:MOPT2}
    CONFIGURE_ARGS+=    --enable-test2=exhaustive
    .else
    CONFIGURE_ARGS+=    --disable-test2
    .endif

5.14.3.3.2. OPT_CONFIGURE_WITH

When option OPT is selected, for each entry in OPT_CONFIGURE_WITH then
--with-_entry is appended to CONFIGURE_ARGS. When option OPT is not
selected, --without-entry is appended to CONFIGURE_ARGS. An optional
argument can be specified with an = symbol. This argument is only
appended to the --with-entry configure option. For example:

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=  OPT1 OPT2
    OPT1_CONFIGURE_WITH=    test1
    OPT2_CONFIGURE_WITH=    test2=exhaustive

is equivalent to:

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=   OPT1 OPT2

    .include <bsd.port.options.mk>

    .if ${PORT_OPTIONS:MOPT1}
    CONFIGURE_ARGS+=    --with-test1
    .else
    CONFIGURE_ARGS+=    --without-test1
    .endif

    .if ${PORT_OPTIONS:MOPT2}
    CONFIGURE_ARGS+=    --with-test2=exhaustive
    .else
    CONFIGURE_ARGS+=    --without-test2
    .endif

5.14.3.3.3. OPT_CONFIGURE_ON and OPT_CONFIGURE_OFF

When option OPT is selected, the value of OPT_CONFIGURE_ON, if defined,
is appended to CONFIGURE_ARGS. OPT_CONFIGURE_OFF works the same way, but
when OPT is not selected. For example:

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=  OPT1
    OPT1_CONFIGURE_ON=  --add-test
    OPT1_CONFIGURE_OFF= --no-test

is equivalent to:

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=  OPT1

    .include <bsd.port.options.mk>

    .if ${PORT_OPTIONS:MOPT1}
    CONFIGURE_ARGS+=    --add-test
    .else
    CONFIGURE_ARGS+=    --no-test
    .endif

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Most of the time, the helpers in  |
|                                   | OPT_CONFIGURE_ENABLE and          |
|                                   | OPT_CONFIGURE_WITH provide a      |
|                                   | shorter and more comprehensive    |
|                                   | functionality.                    |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

5.14.3.4. CMAKE_ARGS Helpers

5.14.3.4.1. OPT_CMAKE_ON and OPT_CMAKE_OFF

When option OPT is selected, the value of OPT_CMAKE_ON, if defined, is
appended to CMAKE_ARGS. OPT_CMAKE_OFF works the same way, but when OPT
is not selected. For example:

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=  OPT1
    OPT1_CMAKE_ON=  -DTEST:BOOL=true -DDEBUG:BOOL=true
    OPT1_CMAKE_OFF= -DOPTIMIZE:BOOL=true

is equivalent to:

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=   OPT1

    .include <bsd.port.options.mk>

    .if ${PORT_OPTIONS:MOPT1}
    CMAKE_ARGS+=    -DTEST:BOOL=true -DDEBUG:BOOL=true
    .else
    CMAKE_ARGS+=    -DOPTIMIZE:BOOL=true
    .endif

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | See OPT_CMAKE_BOOL and            |
|                                   | OPT_CMAKE_BOOL_OFF for a shorter  |
|                                   | helper when the value is boolean. |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

5.14.3.4.2. OPT_CMAKE_BOOL and OPT_CMAKE_BOOL_OFF

When option OPT is selected, for each entry in OPT_CMAKE_BOOL then
-D_entry_:BOOL=true is appended to CMAKE_ARGS. When option OPT is not
selected, -D_entry_:BOOL=false is appended to CONFIGURE_ARGS.
OPT_CMAKE_BOOL_OFF is the opposite, -D_entry_:BOOL=false is appended to
CMAKE_ARGS when the option is selected, and -D_entry_:BOOL=true when the
option is not selected. For example:

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=  OPT1
    OPT1_CMAKE_BOOL=    TEST DEBUG
    OPT1_CMAKE_BOOL_OFF=    OPTIMIZE

is equivalent to:

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=   OPT1

    .include <bsd.port.options.mk>

    .if ${PORT_OPTIONS:MOPT1}
    CMAKE_ARGS+=    -DTEST:BOOL=true -DDEBUG:BOOL=true \
            -DOPTIMIZE:BOOL=false
    .else
    CMAKE_ARGS+=    -DTEST:BOOL=false -DDEBUG:BOOL=false \
            -DOPTIMIZE:BOOL=true
    .endif

5.14.3.5. MESON_ARGS Helpers

5.14.3.5.1. OPT_MESON_ON and OPT_MESON_OFF

When option OPT is selected, the value of OPT_MESON_ON, if defined, is
appended to MESON_ARGS. OPT_MESON_OFF works the same way, but when OPT
is not selected. For example:

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=  OPT1
    OPT1_MESON_ON=  -Dopt=1
    OPT1_MESON_OFF= -Dopt=2

is equivalent to:

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=    OPT1

    .include <bsd.port.options.mk>

    .if ${PORT_OPTIONS:MOPT1}
    MESON_ARGS+=    -Dopt=1
    .else
    MESON_ARGS+=    -Dopt=2
    .endif

5.14.3.5.2. OPT_MESON_TRUE and OPT_MESON_FALSE

When option OPT is selected, for each entry in OPT_MESON_TRUE then
-D_entry_=true is appended to MESON_ARGS. When option OPT is not
selected, -D_entry_=false is appended to MESON_ARGS. OPT_MESON_FALSE is
the opposite, -D_entry_=false is appended to MESON_ARGS when the option
is selected, and -D_entry_=true when the option is not selected. For
example:

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=  OPT1
    OPT1_MESON_TRUE=    test debug
    OPT1_MESON_FALSE=   optimize

is equivalent to:

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=   OPT1

    .include <bsd.port.options.mk>

    .if ${PORT_OPTIONS:MOPT1}
    MESON_ARGS+=    -Dtest=true -Ddebug=true \
            -Doptimize=false
    .else
    MESON_ARGS+=    -Dtest=false -Ddebug=false \
            -Doptimize=true
    .endif

5.14.3.5.3. OPT_MESON_YES and OPT_MESON_NO

When option OPT is selected, for each entry in OPT_MESON_YES then
-D_entry_=yes is appended to MESON_ARGS. When option OPT is not
selected, -D_entry_=no is appended to MESON_ARGS. OPT_MESON_NO is the
opposite, -D_entry_=no is appended to MESON_ARGS when the option is
selected, and -D_entry_=yes when the option is not selected. For
example:

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=  OPT1
    OPT1_MESON_YES= test debug
    OPT1_MESON_NO=  optimize

is equivalent to:

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=   OPT1

    .include <bsd.port.options.mk>

    .if ${PORT_OPTIONS:MOPT1}
    MESON_ARGS+=    -Dtest=yes -Ddebug=yes \
            -Doptimize=no
    .else
    MESON_ARGS+=    -Dtest=no -Ddebug=no \
            -Doptimize=yes
    .endif

5.14.3.5.4. OPT_MESON_ENABLED and OPT_MESON_DISABLED

When option OPT is selected, for each entry in OPT_MESON_ENABLED then
-D_entry_=enabled is appended to MESON_ARGS. When option OPT is not
selected, -D_entry_=disabled is appended to MESON_ARGS.
OPT_MESON_DISABLED is the opposite, -D_entry_=disabled is appended to
MESON_ARGS when the option is selected, and -D_entry_=enabled when the
option is not selected. For example:

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=  OPT1
    OPT1_MESON_ENABLED= test
    OPT1_MESON_DISABLED=    debug

is equivalent to:

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=  OPT1

    .include <bsd.port.options.mk>

    .if ${PORT_OPTIONS:MOPT1}
    MESON_ARGS+=    -Dtest=enabled -Ddebug=disabled
    .else
    MESON_ARGS+=    -Dtest=disabled -Ddebug=enabled
    .endif

5.14.3.6. OPT_QMAKE_ON and OPT_QMAKE_OFF

When option OPT is selected, the value of OPT_QMAKE_ON, if defined, is
appended to QMAKE_ARGS. OPT_QMAKE_OFF works the same way, but when OPT
is not selected. For example:

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=  OPT1
    OPT1_QMAKE_ON=  -DTEST:BOOL=true
    OPT1_QMAKE_OFF= -DPRODUCTION:BOOL=true

is equivalent to:

    OPTIONS_DEFINE= OPT1

    .include <bsd.port.options.mk>

    .if ${PORT_OPTIONS:MOPT1}
    QMAKE_ARGS+=    -DTEST:BOOL=true
    .else
    QMAKE_ARGS+=    -DPRODUCTION:BOOL=true
    .endif

5.14.3.7. OPT_IMPLIES

Provides a way to add dependencies between options.

When OPT is selected, all the options listed in this variable will be
selected too. Using the OPT_CONFIGURE_ENABLE described earlier to
illustrate:

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=    OPT1 OPT2
    OPT1_IMPLIES=   OPT2

    OPT1_CONFIGURE_ENABLE=  opt1
    OPT2_CONFIGURE_ENABLE=  opt2

Is equivalent to:

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=   OPT1 OPT2

    .include <bsd.port.options.mk>

    .if ${PORT_OPTIONS:MOPT1}
    CONFIGURE_ARGS+=    --enable-opt1
    .else
    CONFIGURE_ARGS+=    --disable-opt1
    .endif

    .if ${PORT_OPTIONS:MOPT2} || ${PORT_OPTIONS:MOPT1}
    CONFIGURE_ARGS+=    --enable-opt2
    .else
    CONFIGURE_ARGS+=    --disable-opt2
    .endif

Example 48. Simple Use of OPT_IMPLIES

This port has a X11 option, and a GNOME option that needs the X11 option
to be selected to build.

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=   X11 GNOME
    OPTIONS_DEFAULT=    X11

    X11_USES=   xorg
    X11_USE=    xorg=xi,xextproto
    GNOME_USE=  gnome=gtk30
    GNOME_IMPLIES=  X11

5.14.3.8. OPT_PREVENTS and OPT_PREVENTS_MSG

Provides a way to add conflicts between options.

When OPT is selected, all the options listed in OPT_PREVENTS must be
un-selected. If OPT_PREVENTS_MSG is set and a conflict is triggered, its
content will be shown explaining why they conflict. For example:

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=  OPT1 OPT2
    OPT1_PREVENTS=  OPT2
    OPT1_PREVENTS_MSG=  OPT1 and OPT2 enable conflicting options

Is roughly equivalent to:

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=   OPT1 OPT2

    .include <bsd.port.options.mk>

    .if ${PORT_OPTIONS:MOPT2} && ${PORT_OPTIONS:MOPT1}
    BROKEN= Option OPT1 conflicts with OPT2 (select only one)
    .endif

The only difference is that the first one will write an error after
running make config, suggesting changing the selected options.

Example 49. Simple Use of OPT_PREVENTS

This port has X509 and SCTP options. Both options add patches, but the
patches conflict with each other, so they cannot be selected at the same
time.

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=  X509 SCTP

    SCTP_PATCHFILES=    ${PORTNAME}-6.8p1-sctp-2573.patch.gz:-p1
    SCTP_CONFIGURE_WITH=    sctp

    X509_PATCH_SITES=   http://www.roumenpetrov.info/openssh/x509/:x509
    X509_PATCHFILES=    ${PORTNAME}-7.0p1+x509-8.5.diff.gz:-p1:x509
    X509_PREVENTS=      SCTP
    X509_PREVENTS_MSG=  X509 and SCTP patches conflict

5.14.3.9. OPT_VARS and OPT_VARS_OFF

Provides a generic way to set and append to variables.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Before using OPT_VARS and         |
|                                   | OPT_VARS_OFF, see if there is     |
|                                   | already a more specific helper    |
|                                   | available in Generic Variables    |
|                                   | Replacement, OPT_VARIABLE and     |
|                                   | OPT_VARIABLE_OFF.                 |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

When option OPT is selected, and OPT_VARS defined, key=value and
key+=value pairs are evaluated from OPT_VARS. An = cause the existing
value of KEY to be overwritten, an += appends to the value. OPT_VARS_OFF
works the same way, but when OPT is not selected.

    OPTIONS_DEFINE= OPT1 OPT2 OPT3
    OPT1_VARS=  also_build+=bin1
    OPT2_VARS=  also_build+=bin2
    OPT3_VARS=  bin3_build=yes
    OPT3_VARS_OFF=  bin3_build=no

    MAKE_ARGS=  ALSO_BUILD="${ALSO_BUILD}" BIN3_BUILD="${BIN3_BUILD}"

is equivalent to:

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=  OPT1 OPT2

    MAKE_ARGS=  ALSO_BUILD="${ALSO_BUILD}" BIN3_BUILD="${BIN3_BUILD}"

    .include <bsd.port.options.mk>

    .if ${PORT_OPTIONS:MOPT1}
    ALSO_BUILD+=    bin1
    .endif

    .if ${PORT_OPTIONS:MOPT2}
    ALSO_BUILD+=    bin2
    .endif

    .if ${PORT_OPTIONS:MOPT2}
    BIN3_BUILD= yes
    .else
    BIN3_BUILD= no
    .endif

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Values containing whitespace must |
|                                   | be enclosed in quotes:            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   |     OPT_VARS=    foo="bar baz"    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This is due to the way make(1)    |
|                                   | variable expansion deals with     |
|                                   | whitespace. When                  |
|                                   | OPT_VARS= foo=bar baz is          |
|                                   | expanded, the variable ends up    |
|                                   | containing two strings, foo=bar   |
|                                   | and baz. But the submitter        |
|                                   | probably intended there to be     |
|                                   | only one string, foo=bar baz.     |
|                                   | Quoting the value prevents        |
|                                   | whitespace from being used as a   |
|                                   | delimiter.                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Also, do not add extra spaces     |
|                                   | after the var= sign and before    |
|                                   | the value, it would also be split |
|                                   | into two strings. This will not   |
|                                   | work:                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   |     OPT_VARS=    foo=    bar      |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

5.14.3.10. Dependencies, OPT_DEPTYPE and OPT_DEPTYPE_OFF

For any of these dependency types:

-   PKG_DEPENDS

-   EXTRACT_DEPENDS

-   PATCH_DEPENDS

-   FETCH_DEPENDS

-   BUILD_DEPENDS

-   LIB_DEPENDS

-   RUN_DEPENDS

When option OPT is selected, the value of OPT_DEPTYPE, if defined, is
appended to DEPTYPE. OPT_DEPTYPE_OFF works the same, but when OPT is not
selected. For example:

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=  OPT1
    OPT1_LIB_DEPENDS=   liba.so:devel/a
    OPT1_LIB_DEPENDS_OFF=   libb.so:devel/b

is equivalent to:

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=    OPT1

    .include <bsd.port.options.mk>

    .if ${PORT_OPTIONS:MOPT1}
    LIB_DEPENDS+=   liba.so:devel/a
    .else
    LIB_DEPENDS+=   libb.so:devel/b
    .endif

5.14.3.11. Generic Variables Replacement, OPT_VARIABLE and OPT_VARIABLE_OFF

For any of these variables:

-   ALL_TARGET

-   BINARY_ALIAS

-   BROKEN

-   CATEGORIES

-   CFLAGS

-   CONFIGURE_ENV

-   CONFLICTS

-   CONFLICTS_BUILD

-   PLIST_FILES

-   PLIST_SUB

-   PORTDOCS

-   PORTEXAMPLES

-   SUB_FILES

-   SUB_LIST

-   TEST_TARGET

-   USES

When option OPT is selected, the value of OPT_ABOVEVARIABLE, if defined,
is appended to ABOVEVARIABLE. OPT_ABOVEVARIABLE_OFF works the same way,
but when OPT is not selected. For example:

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=  OPT1
    OPT1_USES=  gmake
    OPT1_CFLAGS_OFF=    -DTEST

is equivalent to:

    OPTIONS_DEFINE= OPT1

    .include <bsd.port.options.mk>

    .if ${PORT_OPTIONS:MOPT1}
    USES+=      gmake
    .else
    CFLAGS+=    -DTEST
    .endif

|                                   | value of all doc; if the option   |
|                                   | is disabled, it would have a      |
|                                   | value of all.                     |

|                                   | of all.                           |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

5.14.3.12. Additional Build Targets, target-OPT-on and target-OPT-off

These Makefile targets can accept optional extra build targets:

-   pre-fetch

-   do-fetch

-   post-fetch

-   pre-extract

-   do-extract

-   post-extract

-   pre-patch

-   do-patch

-   post-patch

-   pre-configure

-   do-configure

-   post-configure

-   pre-build

-   do-build

-   post-build

-   pre-install

-   do-install

-   post-install

-   post-stage

-   pre-package

-   do-package

-   post-package

When option OPT is selected, the target TARGET-OPT-on, if defined, is
executed after TARGET. TARGET-OPT-off works the same way, but when OPT
is not selected. For example:

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=  OPT1

    post-patch-OPT1-on:
        @${REINPLACE_CMD} -e '/opt1/s|/usr/bin/|${EXAMPLESDIR}/|' ${WRKSRC}/Makefile

    post-patch-OPT1-off:
        @${REINPLACE_CMD} -e '/opt1/s|/usr/bin/|${PREFIX}/bin/|' ${WRKSRC}/Makefile

is equivalent to:

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=    OPT1

    .include <bsd.port.options.mk>

    post-patch:
    .if ${PORT_OPTIONS:MOPT1}
        @${REINPLACE_CMD} -e '/opt1/s|/usr/bin/|${EXAMPLESDIR}/|' ${WRKSRC}/Makefile
    .else
        @${REINPLACE_CMD} -e '/opt1/s|/usr/bin/|${PREFIX}/bin/|' ${WRKSRC}/Makefile
    .endif

5.15. Specifying the Working Directory

Each port is extracted into a working directory, which must be writable.
The ports system defaults to having DISTFILES unpack in to a directory
called ${DISTNAME}. In other words, if the Makefile has:

    PORTNAME=    foo
    DISTVERSION=    1.0

then the port’s distribution files contain a top-level directory,
foo-1.0, and the rest of the files are located under that directory.

A number of variables can be overridden if that is not the case.

5.15.1. WRKSRC

The variable lists the name of the directory that is created when the
application’s distfiles are extracted. If our previous example extracted
into a directory called foo (and not foo-1.0) write:

    WRKSRC=    ${WRKDIR}/foo

or possibly

    WRKSRC=    ${WRKDIR}/${PORTNAME}

5.15.2. WRKSRC_SUBDIR

If the source files needed for the port are in a subdirectory of the
extracted distribution file, set WRKSRC_SUBDIR to that directory.

    WRKSRC_SUBDIR=    src

5.15.3. NO_WRKSUBDIR

If the port does not extract in to a subdirectory at all, then set
NO_WRKSUBDIR to indicate that.

    NO_WRKSUBDIR=   yes

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Because WRKDIR is the only        |
|                                   | directory that is supposed to be  |
|                                   | writable during the build, and is |
|                                   | used to store many files          |
|                                   | recording the status of the       |
|                                   | build, the port’s extraction will |
|                                   | be forced into a subdirectory.    |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

5.16. Conflict Handling

There are three different variables to register a conflict between
packages and ports: CONFLICTS, CONFLICTS_INSTALL and CONFLICTS_BUILD.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | The conflict variables            |
|                                   | automatically set the variable    |
|                                   | IGNORE, which is more fully       |
|                                   | documented in Marking a Port Not  |
|                                   | Installable with BROKEN.          |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

When removing one of several conflicting ports, it is advisable to
retain CONFLICTS in those other ports for a few months to cater for
users who only update once in a while.

CONFLICTS_INSTALL

    If the package cannot coexist with other packages (because of file
    conflicts, runtime incompatibilities, etc.). CONFLICTS_INSTALL check
    is done after the build stage and prior to the install stage.

CONFLICTS_BUILD

    If the port cannot be built when other specific ports are already
    installed. Build conflicts are not recorded in the resulting
    package.

CONFLICTS

    If the port cannot be built if a certain port is already installed
    and the resulting package cannot coexist with the other package.
    CONFLICTS check is done prior to the build stage and prior to the
    install stage.

Each space-separated item in the CONFLICTS* variable values is matched
against packages except the one being built, using shell globbing rules.
This allows listing all flavors of a port in a conflict list instead of
having to take pains to exclude the flavor being built from that list.
For example, if git-lite is installed, CONFLICTS_INSTALL=git git-lite
would allow to perform:

    % make -C devel/git FLAVOR=lite all deinstall install

But the following command would report a conflict, since the package
base name installed is git-lite, while git would be built, but cannot be
installed in addition to git-lite:

    % make -C devel/git FLAVOR=default all deinstall install

Without that feature, the Makefile would need one
_flavor__CONFLICTS_INSTALL for each flavor, listing every other flavor.

The most common content of one of these variable is the package base of
another port. The package base is the package name without the appended
version, it can be obtained by running make -V PKGBASE.

Example 50. Basic usage of CONFLICTS*

dns/bind99 cannot be installed if dns/bind910 is present because they
install same files. First gather the package base to use:

    % make -C dns/bind99 -V PKGBASE
    bind99
    % make -C dns/bind910 -V PKGBASE
    bind910

Then add to the Makefile of dns/bind99:

    CONFLICTS_INSTALL=  bind910

And add to the Makefile of dns/bind910:

    CONFLICTS_INSTALL=    bind99

Sometimes, only certain versions of another port are incompatible. When
this is the case, use the full package name including the version. If
necessary, use shell globs like * and ? so that all necessary versions
are matched.

Example 51. Using CONFLICTS* With Globs.

From versions from 2.0 and up-to 2.4.1_2, deskutils/gnotime used to
install a bundled version of databases/qof.

To reflect this past, the Makefile of databases/qof contains:

    CONFLICTS_INSTALL=    gnotime-2.[0-3]* \
                gnotime-2.4.0* gnotime-2.4.1 \
                gnotime-2.4.1_[12]

The first entry match versions 2.0 through 2.3, the second all the
revisions of 2.4.0, the third the exact 2.4.1 version, and the last the
first and second revisions of the 2.4.1 version.

deskutils/gnotime does not have any conflicts line because its current
version does not conflict with anything else.

The variable DISABLE_CONFLICTS may be temporarily set when making
targets that are not affected by conflicts. The variable is not to be
set in port Makefiles.

    % make -DDISABLE_CONFLICTS patch

5.17. Installing Files

|                                   | important to the end user because |
|                                   | it adds files to their system.    |
|                                   | All the additional commands run   |
|                                   | in the port Makefile's *-install  |
|                                   | targets should be echoed to the   |
|                                   | screen. Do not silence these      |
|                                   | commands with @ or .SILENT.       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

5.17.1. INSTALL_* Macros

Use the macros provided in bsd.port.mk to ensure correct modes of files
in the port’s *-install targets. Set ownership directly in pkg-plist
with the corresponding entries, such as @(owner,group,), @owner owner,
and @group group. These operators work until overridden, or until the
end of pkg-plist, so remember to reset them after they are no longer
needed. The default ownership is root:wheel. See Base Keywords for more
information.

-   INSTALL_PROGRAM is a command to install binary executables.

-   INSTALL_SCRIPT is a command to install executable scripts.

-   INSTALL_LIB is a command to install shared libraries (but not static
    libraries).

-   INSTALL_KLD is a command to install kernel loadable modules. Some
    architectures do not like having the modules stripped, so use this
    command instead of INSTALL_PROGRAM.

-   INSTALL_DATA is a command to install sharable data, including static
    libraries.

-   INSTALL_MAN is a command to install manpages and other documentation
    (it does not compress anything).

These variables are set to the install(1) command with the appropriate
flags for each situation.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Do not use INSTALL_LIB to install |
|                                   | static libraries, because         |
|                                   | stripping them renders them       |
|                                   | useless. Use INSTALL_DATA         |
|                                   | instead.                          |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

5.17.2. Stripping Binaries and Shared Libraries

Installed binaries should be stripped. Do not strip binaries manually
unless absolutely required. The INSTALL_PROGRAM macro installs and
strips a binary at the same time. The INSTALL_LIB macro does the same
thing to shared libraries.

When a file must be stripped, but neither INSTALL_PROGRAM nor
INSTALL_LIB macros are desirable, ${STRIP_CMD} strips the program or
shared library. This is typically done within the post-install target.
For example:

    post-install:
        ${STRIP_CMD} ${STAGEDIR}${PREFIX}/bin/xdl

When multiple files need to be stripped:

    post-install:
    .for l in geometry media body track world
        ${STRIP_CMD} ${STAGEDIR}${PREFIX}/lib/lib${PORTNAME}-${l}.so.0
    .endfor

Use file(1) on a file to determine if it has been stripped. Binaries are
reported by file(1) as stripped, or not stripped. Additionally, strip(1)
will detect programs that have already been stripped and exit cleanly.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | When WITH_DEBUG is defined, elf   |
|                                   | files must not be stripped.       |

|                                   | or remove it unconditionally and  |
|                                   | use STRIP_CMD in post-install.    |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

5.17.3. Installing a Whole Tree of Files

Sometimes, a large number of files must be installed while preserving
their hierarchical organization. For example, copying over a whole
directory tree from WRKSRC to a target directory under PREFIX. Note that
PREFIX, EXAMPLESDIR, DATADIR, and other path variables must always be
prepended with STAGEDIR to respect staging (see Staging).

Two macros exist for this situation. The advantage of using these macros
instead of cp is that they guarantee proper file ownership and
permissions on target files. The first macro, COPYTREE_BIN, will set all
the installed files to be executable, thus being suitable for installing
into PREFIX/bin. The second macro, COPYTREE_SHARE, does not set
executable permissions on files, and is therefore suitable for
installing files under PREFIX/share target.

    post-install:
        ${MKDIR} ${STAGEDIR}${EXAMPLESDIR}
        (cd ${WRKSRC}/examples && ${COPYTREE_SHARE} . ${STAGEDIR}${EXAMPLESDIR})

This example will install the contents of the examples directory in the
vendor distfile to the proper examples location of the port.

    post-install:
        ${MKDIR} ${STAGEDIR}${DATADIR}/summer
        (cd ${WRKSRC}/temperatures && ${COPYTREE_SHARE} "June July August" ${STAGEDIR}${DATADIR}/summer)

And this example will install the data of summer months to the summer
subdirectory of a DATADIR.

Additional find arguments can be passed via the third argument to
COPYTREE_* macros. For example, to install all files from the first
example except Makefiles, one can use these commands.

    post-install:
        ${MKDIR} ${STAGEDIR}${EXAMPLESDIR}
        (cd ${WRKSRC}/examples && \
        ${COPYTREE_SHARE} . ${STAGEDIR}${EXAMPLESDIR} "! -name Makefile")

These macros do not add the installed files to pkg-plist. They must be
added manually. For optional documentation (PORTDOCS, see Install
Additional Documentation) and examples (PORTEXAMPLES), the %%PORTDOCS%%
or %%PORTEXAMPLES%% prefixes must be prepended in pkg-plist.

5.17.4. Install Additional Documentation

If the software has some documentation other than the standard man and
info pages that is useful for the user, install it under DOCSDIR. This
can be done, like the previous item, in the post-install target.

Create a new directory for the port. The directory name is DOCSDIR. This
usually equals PORTNAME. However, if the user might want different
versions of the port to be installed at the same time, the whole PKGNAME
can be used.

Since only the files listed in pkg-plist are installed, it is safe to
always install documentation to STAGEDIR (see Staging). Hence .if blocks
are only needed when the installed files are large enough to cause
significant I/O overhead.

    post-install:
        ${MKDIR} ${STAGEDIR}${DOCSDIR}
        ${INSTALL_DATA} ${WRKSRC}/docs/xvdocs.ps ${STAGEDIR}${DOCSDIR}

On the other hand, if there is a DOCS option in the port, install the
documentation in a post-install-DOCS-on target. These targets are
described in Additional Build Targets, target-OPT-on and target-OPT-off.

Here are some handy variables and how they are expanded by default when
used in the Makefile:

-   DATADIR gets expanded to PREFIX/share/PORTNAME.

-   DATADIR_REL gets expanded to share/PORTNAME.

-   DOCSDIR gets expanded to PREFIX/share/doc/PORTNAME.

-   DOCSDIR_REL gets expanded to share/doc/PORTNAME.

-   EXAMPLESDIR gets expanded to PREFIX/share/examples/PORTNAME.

-   EXAMPLESDIR_REL gets expanded to share/examples/PORTNAME.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | The DOCS option only controls     |
|                                   | additional documentation          |
|                                   | installed in DOCSDIR. It does not |
|                                   | apply to standard man pages and   |
|                                   | info pages. Things installed in   |
|                                   | EXAMPLESDIR are controlled by the |
|                                   | EXAMPLES option.                  |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

These variables are exported to PLIST_SUB. Their values will appear
there as pathnames relative to PREFIX if possible. That is,
share/doc/PORTNAME will be substituted for %%DOCSDIR%% in the packing
list by default, and so on. (See more on pkg-plist substitution here.)

All conditionally installed documentation files and directories are
included in pkg-plist with the %%PORTDOCS%% prefix, for example:

    %%PORTDOCS%%%%DOCSDIR%%/AUTHORS
    %%PORTDOCS%%%%DOCSDIR%%/CONTACT

As an alternative to enumerating the documentation files in pkg-plist, a
port can set the variable PORTDOCS to a list of file names and shell
glob patterns to add to the final packing list. The names will be
relative to DOCSDIR. Therefore, a port that utilizes PORTDOCS, and uses
a non-default location for its documentation, must set DOCSDIR
accordingly. If a directory is listed in PORTDOCS or matched by a glob
pattern from this variable, the entire subtree of contained files and
directories will be registered in the final packing list. If the DOCS
option has been unset then files and directories listed in PORTDOCS
would not be installed or added to port packing list. Installing the
documentation at PORTDOCS as shown above remains up to the port itself.
A typical example of utilizing PORTDOCS:

    PORTDOCS=   README.* ChangeLog docs/*

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | The equivalents of PORTDOCS for   |
|                                   | files installed under DATADIR and |
|                                   | EXAMPLESDIR are PORTDATA and      |
|                                   | PORTEXAMPLES, respectively.       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The contents of pkg-message are   |
|                                   | displayed upon installation. See  |
|                                   | the section on using pkg-message  |
|                                   | for details. pkg-message does not |
|                                   | need to be added to pkg-plist.    |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

5.17.5. Subdirectories Under PREFIX

Try to let the port put things in the right subdirectories of PREFIX.
Some ports lump everything and put it in the subdirectory with the
port’s name, which is incorrect. Also, many ports put everything except
binaries, header files and manual pages in a subdirectory of lib, which
does not work well with the BSD paradigm. Many of the files must be
moved to one of these directories: etc (setup/configuration files),
libexec (executables started internally), sbin (executables for
superusers/managers), info (documentation for info browser) or share
(architecture independent files). See hier(7) for details; the rules
governing /usr pretty much apply to /usr/local too. The exception are
ports dealing with USENET "news". They may use PREFIX/news as a
destination for their files.

5.18. Use BINARY_ALIAS to Rename Commands Instead of Patching the Build

When BINARY_ALIAS is defined it will create symlinks of the given
commands in a directory which will be prepended to PATH.

Use it to substitute hardcoded commands the build phase relies on
without having to patch any build files.

Example 52. Using BINARY_ALIAS to Make gsed Available as sed

Some ports expect sed to behave like GNU sed and use features that
sed(1) does not provide. GNU sed is available from textproc/gsed on
FreeBSD.

Use BINARY_ALIAS to substitute sed with gsed for the duration of the
build:

    BUILD_DEPENDS=   gsed:textproc/gsed
    ...
    BINARY_ALIAS=   sed=gsed

Example 53. Using BINARY_ALIAS to Provide Aliases for Hardcoded python3
Commands

A port that has a hardcoded reference to python3 in its build scripts
will need to have it available in PATH at build time. Use BINARY_ALIAS
to create an alias that points to the right Python 3 binary:

    USES=  python:3.4+,build
    ...
    BINARY_ALIAS=   python3=${PYTHON_CMD}

See Using Python for more information about USES=python.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Binary aliases are created after  |
|                                   | the dependencies provided via     |
|                                   | BUILD_DEPENDS and LIB_DEPENDS are |
|                                   | processed and before the          |
|                                   | configure target. This leads to   |
|                                   | various limitations. For example, |
|                                   | programs installed via            |
|                                   | TEST_DEPENDS cannot be used to    |
|                                   | create a binary alias as test     |
|                                   | dependencies specified this way   |
|                                   | are processed after binary        |
|                                   | aliases are created.              |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Chapter 6. Special Considerations

This section explains the most common things to consider when creating a
port.

6.1. Staging

bsd.port.mk expects ports to work with a "stage directory". This means
that a port must not install files directly to the regular destination
directories (that is, under PREFIX, for example) but instead into a
separate directory from which the package is then built. In many cases,
this does not require root privileges, making it possible to build
packages as an unprivileged user. With staging, the port is built and
installed into the stage directory, STAGEDIR. A package is created from
the stage directory and then installed on the system. Automake tools
refer to this concept as DESTDIR, but in FreeBSD, DESTDIR has a
different meaning (see PREFIX and DESTDIR).

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | No port really needs to be root.  |
|                                   | It can mostly be avoided by using |
|                                   | USES=uidfix. If the port still    |
|                                   | runs commands like chown(8),      |
|                                   | chgrp(1), or forces owner or      |
|                                   | group with install(1) then use    |
|                                   | USES=fakeroot to fake those       |
|                                   | calls. Some patching of the       |
|                                   | port’s Makefiles will be needed.  |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Meta ports, or ports that do not install files themselves but only
depend on other ports, must avoid needlessly extracting the mtree(8) to
the stage directory. This is the basic directory layout of the package,
and these empty directories will be seen as orphans. To prevent mtree(8)
extraction, add this line:

    NO_MTREE=  yes

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Metaports should use              |
|                                   | USES=metaport. It sets up         |
|                                   | defaults for ports that do not    |
|                                   | fetch, build, or install          |
|                                   | anything.                         |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Staging is enabled by prepending STAGEDIR to paths used in the
pre-install, do-install, and post-install targets (see the examples
through the book). Typically, this includes PREFIX, ETCDIR, DATADIR,
EXAMPLESDIR, MANPREFIX, DOCSDIR, and so on. Directories should be
created as part of the post-install target. Avoid using absolute paths
whenever possible.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Ports that install kernel modules |
|                                   | must prepend STAGEDIR to their    |
|                                   | destination, by default           |
|                                   | /boot/modules.                    |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

6.1.1. Handling Symbolic Links

When creating a symbolic link, relative ones are strongly recommended.
Use ${RLN} to create relative symbolic links. It uses install(1) under
the hood to automatically figure out the relative link to create.

Example 54. Create Relative Symbolic Links Automatically

${RLN} uses install(1)'s relative symbolic feature which frees the
porter of computing the relative path.

    ${RLN} ${STAGEDIR}${PREFIX}/lib/libfoo.so.42 ${STAGEDIR}${PREFIX}/lib/libfoo.so
    ${RLN} ${STAGEDIR}${PREFIX}/libexec/foo/bar ${STAGEDIR}${PREFIX}/bin/bar
    ${RLN} ${STAGEDIR}/var/cache/foo ${STAGEDIR}${PREFIX}/share/foo

Will generate:

    % ls -lF ${STAGEDIR}${PREFIX}/lib
    lrwxr-xr-x  1 nobody  nobody    181 Aug  3 11:27 libfoo.so@ -> libfoo.so.42
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 nobody  nobody     15 Aug  3 11:24 libfoo.so.42*
    % ls -lF ${STAGEDIR}${PREFIX}/bin
    lrwxr-xr-x  1 nobody  nobody    181 Aug  3 11:27 bar@ -> ../libexec/foo/bar
    % ls -lF ${STAGEDIRDIR}${PREFIX}/share
    lrwxr-xr-x  1 nobody  nobody    181 Aug  3 11:27 foo@ -> ../../../var/cache/foo

6.2. Bundled Libraries

This section explains why bundled dependencies are considered bad and
what to do about them.

6.2.1. Why Bundled Libraries Are Bad

Some software requires the porter to locate third-party libraries and
add the required dependencies to the port. Other software bundles all
necessary libraries into the distribution file. The second approach
seems easier at first, but there are some serious drawbacks:

This list is loosely based on the Fedora and Gentoo wikis, both licensed
under the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license.

Security

    If vulnerabilities are found in the upstream library and fixed
    there, they might not be fixed in the library bundled with the port.
    One reason could be that the author is not aware of the problem.
    This means that the porter must fix them, or upgrade to a
    non-vulnerable version, and send a patch to the author. This all
    takes time, which results in software being vulnerable longer than
    necessary. This in turn makes it harder to coordinate a fix without
    unnecessarily leaking information about the vulnerability.

Bugs

    This problem is similar to the problem with security in the last
    paragraph, but generally less severe.

Forking

    It is easier for the author to fork the upstream library once it is
    bundled. While convenient on first sight, it means that the code
    diverges from upstream making it harder to address security or other
    problems with the software. A reason for this is that patching
    becomes harder.

    Another problem of forking is that because code diverges from
    upstream, bugs get solved over and over again instead of just once
    at a central location. This defeats the idea of open source software
    in the first place.

Symbol collision

    When a library is installed on the system, it might collide with the
    bundled version. This can cause immediate errors at compile or link
    time. It can also cause errors when running the program which might
    be harder to track down. The latter problem could be caused because
    the versions of the two libraries are incompatible.

Licensing

    When bundling projects from different sources, license issues can
    arise more easily, especially when licenses are incompatible.

Waste of resources

    Bundled libraries waste resources on several levels. It takes longer
    to build the actual application, especially if these libraries are
    already present on the system. At run-time, they can take up
    unnecessary memory when the system-wide library is already loaded by
    one program and the bundled library is loaded by another program.

Waste of effort

    When a library needs patches for FreeBSD, these patches have to be
    duplicated again in the bundled library. This wastes developer time
    because the patches might not apply cleanly. It can also be hard to
    notice that these patches are required in the first place.

6.2.2. What to do About Bundled Libraries

Whenever possible, use the unbundled version of the library by adding a
LIB_DEPENDS to the port. If such a port does not exist yet, consider
creating it.

Only use bundled libraries if the upstream has a good track record on
security and using unbundled versions leads to overly complex patches.

|                                   | port has to bundle libraries,     |
|                                   | because they are in a different   |
|                                   | architecture, or they have been   |
|                                   | modified to fit the software’s    |
|                                   | use. In that case, those          |
|                                   | libraries should not be exposed   |
|                                   | to other ports for linking. Add   |
|                                   | BUNDLE_LIBS=yes to the port’s     |
|                                   | Makefile. This will tell pkg(8)   |
|                                   | to not compute provided           |
|                                   | libraries. Always ask the Ports   |
|                                   | Management Team                   |
|                                   | <portmgr@FreeBSD.org> before      |
|                                   | adding this to a port.            |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

6.3. Shared Libraries

If the port installs one or more shared libraries, define a USE_LDCONFIG
make variable, which will instruct a bsd.port.mk to run ${LDCONFIG} -m
on the directory where the new library is installed (usually PREFIX/lib)
during post-install target to register it into the shared library cache.
This variable, when defined, will also facilitate addition of an
appropriate @exec /sbin/ldconfig -m and @unexec /sbin/ldconfig -R pair
into pkg-plist, so that a user who installed the package can start using
the shared library immediately and de-installation will not cause the
system to still believe the library is there.

    USE_LDCONFIG=  yes

The default directory can be overridden by setting USE_LDCONFIG to a
list of directories into which shared libraries are to be installed. For
example, if the port installs shared libraries into PREFIX/lib/foo and
PREFIX/lib/bar use this in Makefile:

    USE_LDCONFIG= ${PREFIX}/lib/foo ${PREFIX}/lib/bar

Please double-check, often this is not necessary at all or can be
avoided through -rpath or setting LD_RUN_PATH during linking (see
lang/mosml for an example), or through a shell-wrapper which sets
LD_LIBRARY_PATH before invoking the binary, like www/seamonkey does.

When installing 32-bit libraries on a 64-bit system, use USE_LDCONFIG32
instead.

If the software uses autotools, and specifically libtool, add
USES=libtool.

When the major library version number increments in the update to the
new port version, all other ports that link to the affected library must
have their PORTREVISION incremented, to force recompilation with the new
library version.

6.4. Ports with Distribution Restrictions or Legal Concerns

Licenses vary, and some of them place restrictions on how the
application can be packaged, whether it can be sold for profit, and so
on.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | It is the responsibility of a     |
|                                   | porter to read the licensing      |
|                                   | terms of the software and make    |
|                                   | sure that the FreeBSD project     |
|                                   | will not be held accountable for  |
|                                   | violating them by redistributing  |
|                                   | the source or compiled binaries   |
|                                   | either via FTP/HTTP or CD-ROM. If |
|                                   | in doubt, please contact the      |
|                                   | FreeBSD ports mailing list.       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

In situations like this, the variables described in the next sections
can be set.

6.4.1. NO_PACKAGE

This variable indicates that we may not generate a binary package of the
application. For instance, the license may disallow binary
redistribution, or it may prohibit distribution of packages created from
patched sources.

However, the port’s DISTFILES may be freely mirrored on FTP/HTTP. They
may also be distributed on a CD-ROM (or similar media) unless NO_CDROM
is set as well.

If the binary package is not generally useful, and the application must
always be compiled from the source code, use NO_PACKAGE. For example, if
the application has configuration information that is site specific hard
coded into it at compile time, set NO_PACKAGE.

Set NO_PACKAGE to a string describing the reason why the package cannot
be generated.

6.4.2. NO_CDROM

This variable alone indicates that, although we are allowed to generate
binary packages, we may put neither those packages nor the port’s
DISTFILES onto a CD-ROM (or similar media) for resale. However, the
binary packages and the port’s DISTFILES will still be available via
FTP/HTTP.

If this variable is set along with NO_PACKAGE, then only the port’s
DISTFILES will be available, and only via FTP/HTTP.

Set NO_CDROM to a string describing the reason why the port cannot be
redistributed on CD-ROM. For instance, use this if the port’s license is
for "non-commercial" use only.

6.4.3. NOFETCHFILES

Files defined in NOFETCHFILES are not fetchable from any of
MASTER_SITES. An example of such a file is when the file is supplied on
CD-ROM by the vendor.

Tools which check for the availability of these files on MASTER_SITES
have to ignore these files and not report about them.

6.4.4. RESTRICTED

Set this variable alone if the application’s license permits neither
mirroring the application’s DISTFILES nor distributing the binary
package in any way.

Do not set NO_CDROM or NO_PACKAGE along with RESTRICTED, since the
latter variable implies the former ones.

Set RESTRICTED to a string describing the reason why the port cannot be
redistributed. Typically, this indicates that the port contains
proprietary software and that the user will need to manually download
the DISTFILES, possibly after registering for the software or agreeing
to accept the terms of an EULA.

6.4.5. RESTRICTED_FILES

When RESTRICTED or NO_CDROM is set, this variable defaults to
${DISTFILES} ${PATCHFILES}, otherwise it is empty. If only some of the
distribution files are restricted, then set this variable to list them.

6.4.6. LEGAL_TEXT

If the port has legal concerns not addressed by the above variables, set
LEGAL_TEXT to a string explaining the concern. For example, if special
permission was obtained for FreeBSD to redistribute the binary, this
variable must indicate so.

6.4.7. /usr/ports/LEGAL and LEGAL

A port which sets any of the above variables must also be added to
/usr/ports/LEGAL. The first column is a glob which matches the
restricted distfiles. The second column is the port’s origin. The third
column is the output of make -VLEGAL.

6.4.8. Examples

The preferred way to state "the distfiles for this port must be fetched
manually" is as follows:

    .if !exists(${DISTDIR}/${DISTNAME}${EXTRACT_SUFX})
    IGNORE= may not be redistributed because of licensing reasons. Please visit some-website to accept their license and download ${DISTFILES} into ${DISTDIR}
    .endif

This both informs the user, and sets the proper metadata on the user’s
machine for use by automated programs.

Note that this stanza must be preceded by an inclusion of
bsd.port.pre.mk.

6.5. Building Mechanisms

6.5.1. Building Ports in Parallel

The FreeBSD ports framework supports parallel building using multiple
make sub-processes, which allows SMP systems to utilize all of their
available CPU power, allowing port builds to be faster and more
effective.

This is achieved by passing -jX flag to make(1) running on vendor code.
This is the default build behavior of ports. Unfortunately, not all
ports handle parallel building well and it may be required to explicitly
disable this feature by adding the MAKE_JOBS_UNSAFE=yes variable. It is
used when a port is known to be broken with -jX due to race conditions
causing intermittent build failures.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | When setting MAKE_JOBS_UNSAFE, it |
|                                   | is very important to explain      |
|                                   | either with a comment in the      |
|                                   | Makefile, or at least in the      |
|                                   | commit message, why the port does |
|                                   | not build when enabling.          |
|                                   | Otherwise, it is almost           |
|                                   | impossible to either fix the      |
|                                   | problem, or test if it has been   |
|                                   | fixed when committing an update   |
|                                   | at a later date.                  |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

6.5.2. make, gmake, and imake

Several differing make implementations exist. Ported software often
requires a particular implementation, like GNU`make`, known in FreeBSD
as gmake.

If the port uses GNU make, add gmake to USES.

MAKE_CMD can be used to reference the specific command configured by the
USES setting in the port’s Makefile. Only use MAKE_CMD within the
application Makefiles in WRKSRC to call the make implementation expected
by the ported software.

If the port is an X application that uses imake to create Makefiles from
Imakefiles, set USES= imake. See the USES=imake section of Using USES
Macros for more details.

If the port’s source Makefile has something other than all as the main
build target, set ALL_TARGET accordingly. The same goes for install and
INSTALL_TARGET.

6.5.3. configure Script

If the port uses the configure script to generate Makefile from
Makefile.in, set GNU_CONFIGURE=yes. To give extra arguments to the
configure script (the default argument is
--prefix=${PREFIX} --infodir=${PREFIX}/${INFO_PATH} --mandir=${MANPREFIX}/man --build=${CONFIGURE_TARGET}),
set those extra arguments in CONFIGURE_ARGS. Extra environment variables
can be passed using CONFIGURE_ENV.

| GNU_CONFIGURE                     | The port uses configure script to |

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| HAS_CONFIGURE                     | Same as GNU_CONFIGURE, except     |

6.5.4. Using cmake

For ports that use CMake, define USES= cmake.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

|                                   | is set.                           |

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

: Table 11. Variables the Users Can Define for cmake Builds

CMake supports these build profiles: Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo and
MinSizeRel. Debug and Release profiles respect system *FLAGS,
RelWithDebInfo and MinSizeRel will set CFLAGS to -O2 -g and -Os -DNDEBUG
correspondingly. The lower-cased value of CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is exported
to PLIST_SUB and must be used if the port installs *.cmake depending on
the build type (see devel/kf5-kcrash for an example). Please note that
some projects may define their own build profiles and/or force
particular build type by setting CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE in CMakeLists.txt. To
make a port for such a project respect CFLAGS and WITH_DEBUG, the
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE definitions must be removed from those files.

Most CMake-based projects support an out-of-source method of building.
The out-of-source build for a port is the default setting. An in-source
build can be requested by using the :insource suffix. With out-of-source
builds, CONFIGURE_WRKSRC, BUILD_WRKSRC and INSTALL_WRKSRC will be set to
${WRKDIR}/.build and this directory will be used to keep all files
generated during configuration and build stages, leaving the source
directory intact.

Example 55. USES= cmake Example

This snippet demonstrates the use of CMake for a port. CMAKE_SOURCE_PATH
is not usually required, but can be set when the sources are not located
in the top directory, or if only a subset of the project is intended to
be built by the port.

    USES=           cmake
    CMAKE_SOURCE_PATH=  ${WRKSRC}/subproject

Example 56. CMAKE_ON and CMAKE_OFF

When adding boolean values to CMAKE_ARGS, it is easier to use the
CMAKE_ON and CMAKE_OFF variables instead. This:

    CMAKE_ON=    VAR1 VAR2
    CMAKE_OFF=  VAR3

Is equivalent to:

    CMAKE_ARGS=   -DVAR1:BOOL=TRUE -DVAR2:BOOL=TRUE -DVAR3:BOOL=FALSE

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | This is only for the default      |
|                                   | values off CMAKE_ARGS. The        |
|                                   | helpers described in              |
|                                   | OPT_CMAKE_BOOL and                |
|                                   | OPT_CMAKE_BOOL_OFF use the same   |
|                                   | semantics, but for optional       |
|                                   | values.                           |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

6.5.5. Using scons

If the port uses SCons, define USES=scons.

To make third party SConstruct respect everything that is passed to
SCons in the environment (that is, most importantly,
CC/CXX/CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS), patch SConstruct so build Environment is
constructed like this:

    env = Environment(**ARGUMENTS)

It may be then modified with env.Append and env.Replace.

6.5.6. Building Rust Applications with cargo

For ports that use Cargo, define USES=cargo.

Example 57. Creating a Port for a Simple Rust Application

Creating a Cargo based port is a three stage process. First we need to
provide a ports template that fetches the application distribution file:

    PORTNAME=   tokei
    DISTVERSIONPREFIX=  v
    DISTVERSION=    7.0.2
    CATEGORIES= devel

    MAINTAINER= tobik@FreeBSD.org
    COMMENT=    Display statistics about your code
    WWW=        https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei/

    USES=       cargo
    USE_GITHUB= yes
    GH_ACCOUNT= Aaronepower

    .include <bsd.port.mk>

Generate an initial distinfo:

    % make makesum
    => Aaronepower-tokei-v7.0.2_GH0.tar.gz doesn't seem to exist in /usr/ports/distfiles/.
    => Attempting to fetch https://codeload.github.com/Aaronepower/tokei/tar.gz/v7.0.2?dummy=/Aaronepower-tokei-v7.0.2_GH0.tar.gz
    fetch: https://codeload.github.com/Aaronepower/tokei/tar.gz/v7.0.2?dummy=/Aaronepower-tokei-v7.0.2_GH0.tar.gz: size of remote file is not known
    Aaronepower-tokei-v7.0.2_GH0.tar.gz                     45 kB  239 kBps 00m00s

Now the distribution file is ready to use and we can go ahead and
extract crate dependencies from the bundled Cargo.lock:

    % make cargo-crates
    CARGO_CRATES=   aho-corasick-0.6.4 \
                    ansi_term-0.11.0 \
                    arrayvec-0.4.7 \
                    atty-0.2.9 \
                    bitflags-1.0.1 \
                    byteorder-1.2.2 \
                    [...]

The output of this command needs to be pasted directly into the
Makefile:

    PORTNAME=    tokei
    DISTVERSIONPREFIX=  v
    DISTVERSION=    7.0.2
    CATEGORIES= devel

    MAINTAINER= tobik@FreeBSD.org

distinfo needs to be regenerated to contain all the crate distribution

The port is now ready for a test build and further adjustments like
creating a plist, writing a description, adding license information,
options, etc. as normal.

If you are not testing your port in a clean environment like with
Poudriere, remember to run make clean before any testing.

Example 58. Enabling Additional Application Features

Some applications define additional features in their Cargo.toml. They
can be compiled in by setting CARGO_FEATURES in the port.

Here we enable Tokei’s json and yaml features:

    CARGO_FEATURES= json yaml

Example 59. Encoding Application Features As Port Options

An example [features] section in Cargo.toml could look like this:

    [features]
    pulseaudio_backend = ["librespot-playback/pulseaudio-backend"]
    portaudio_backend = ["librespot-playback/portaudio-backend"]
    default = ["pulseaudio_backend"]

pulseaudio_backend is a default feature. It is always enabled unless we
explicitly turn off default features by adding --no-default-features to
CARGO_FEATURES. Here we turn the portaudio_backend and
pulseaudio_backend features into port options:

    CARGO_FEATURES=   --no-default-features

    OPTIONS_DEFINE= PORTAUDIO PULSEAUDIO

    PORTAUDIO_VARS=     CARGO_FEATURES+=portaudio_backend
    PULSEAUDIO_VARS=    CARGO_FEATURES+=pulseaudio_backend

Example 60. Listing Crate Licenses

Crates have their own licenses. It is important to know what they are
when adding a LICENSE block to the port (see Licenses). The helper
target cargo-crates-licenses will try to list all the licenses of all
crates defined in CARGO_CRATES.

    % make cargo-crates-licenses
    aho-corasick-0.6.4  Unlicense/MIT
    ansi_term-0.11.0    MIT
    arrayvec-0.4.7      MIT/Apache-2.0
    atty-0.2.9          MIT
    bitflags-1.0.1      MIT/Apache-2.0
    byteorder-1.2.2     Unlicense/MIT

6.5.7. Using meson

For ports that use Meson, define USES=meson.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

: Table 13. Variables for Ports That Use meson

Example 61. USES=meson Example

This snippet demonstrates the use of Meson for a port.

    USES=     meson
    MESON_ARGS= -Dfoo=enabled

6.5.8. Building Go Applications

For ports that use Go, define USES=go. Refer to go for a list of
variables that can be set to control the build process.

Example 62. Creating a Port for a Go Modules Based Application

In most cases, it is sufficient to set the GO_MODULE variable to the
value specified by the module directive in go.mod:

    PORTNAME=       hey
    PORTVERSION=    0.1.4
    DISTVERSIONPREFIX=      v
    CATEGORIES=     benchmarks

    MAINTAINER=     dmgk@FreeBSD.org
    COMMENT=        Tiny program that sends some load to a web application
    WWW=            https://github.com/rakyll/hey/

    LICENSE=        APACHE20
    LICENSE_FILE=   ${WRKSRC}/LICENSE

    USES=           go:modules
    GO_MODULE=      github.com/rakyll/hey

    PLIST_FILES=    bin/hey

    .include <bsd.port.mk>

If the "easy" way is not adequate or more control over dependencies is
needed, the full porting process is described below.

Creating a Go-based port is a five-stage process. First we need to
provide a ports template that fetches the application distribution file:

    PORTNAME=   ghq
    DISTVERSIONPREFIX=  v
    DISTVERSION=    0.12.5
    CATEGORIES= devel

    MAINTAINER= tobik@FreeBSD.org
    COMMENT=    Remote repository management made easy
    WWW=        https://github.com/x-motemen/ghq/

    USES=       go:modules
    USE_GITHUB= yes
    GH_ACCOUNT= motemen

    .include <bsd.port.mk>

Generate an initial distinfo:

    % make makesum
    ===>  License MIT accepted by the user
    => motemen-ghq-v0.12.5_GH0.tar.gz doesn't seem to exist in /usr/ports/distfiles/.
    => Attempting to fetch https://codeload.github.com/motemen/ghq/tar.gz/v0.12.5?dummy=/motemen-ghq-v0.12.5_GH0.tar.gz
    fetch: https://codeload.github.com/motemen/ghq/tar.gz/v0.12.5?dummy=/motemen-ghq-v0.12.5_GH0.tar.gz: size of remote file is not known
    motemen-ghq-v0.12.5_GH0.tar.gz                          32 kB  177 kBps    00s

Now the distribution file is ready to use and we can extract the
required Go module dependencies. This step requires having
ports-mgmt/modules2tuple installed:

    % make gomod-vendor
    [...]
    GH_TUPLE=    \
            Songmu:gitconfig:v0.0.2:songmu_gitconfig/vendor/github.com/Songmu/gitconfig \

            urfave:cli:v1.20.0:urfave_cli/vendor/github.com/urfave/cli

The output of this command needs to be pasted directly into the
Makefile:

    PORTNAME=    ghq
    DISTVERSIONPREFIX=  v
    DISTVERSION=    0.12.5
    CATEGORIES= devel

    MAINTAINER= tobik@FreeBSD.org

            urfave:cli:v1.20.0:urfave_cli/vendor/github.com/urfave/cli

    .include <bsd.port.mk>

distinfo needs to be regenerated to contain all the distribution files:

    % make makesum
    => Songmu-gitconfig-v0.0.2_GH0.tar.gz doesn't seem to exist in /usr/ports/distfiles/.
    => Attempting to fetch https://codeload.github.com/Songmu/gitconfig/tar.gz/v0.0.2?dummy=/Songmu-gitconfig-v0.0.2_GH0.tar.gz

    [...]

The port is now ready for a test build and further adjustments like
creating a plist, writing a description, adding license information,
options, etc. as normal.

If you are not testing your port in a clean environment like with
Poudriere, remember to run make clean before any testing.

Example 63. Setting Output Binary Name or Installation Path

Some ports need to install the resulting binary under a different name
or to a path other than the default ${PREFIX}/bin. This can be done by
using GO_TARGET tuple syntax, for example:

    GO_TARGET=  ./cmd/ipfs:ipfs-go

will install ipfs binary as ${PREFIX}/bin/ipfs-go and

    GO_TARGET=  ./dnscrypt-proxy:${PREFIX}/sbin/dnscrypt-proxy

will install dnscrypt-proxy to ${PREFIX}/sbin.

6.5.9. Building Haskell Applications with cabal

For ports that use Cabal, build system defines USES=cabal. Refer to
cabal for a list of variables that can be set to control the build
process.

Example 64. Creating a Port for a Hackage-hosted Haskell Application

When preparing a Haskell Cabal port, devel/hs-cabal-install and
ports-mgmt/hs-cabal2tuple programs are required, so make sure they are
installed beforehand. First we need to define common ports variables
that allow cabal-install to fetch the package distribution file:

    PORTNAME= ShellCheck
    DISTVERSION=    0.6.0
    CATEGORIES= devel

    MAINTAINER= haskell@FreeBSD.org
    COMMENT=    Shell script analysis tool
    WWW=        https://www.shellcheck.net/

    USES=       cabal

    .include <bsd.port.mk>

This minimal Makefile fetches the distribution file with the
cabal-extract helper target:

    % make cabal-extract
    [...]
    Downloading the latest package list from hackage.haskell.org
    cabal get ShellCheck-0.6.0
    Downloading  ShellCheck-0.6.0
    Downloaded   ShellCheck-0.6.0
    Unpacking to ShellCheck-0.6.0/

Now that we have ShellCheck.cabal package description file under
${WRKSRC}, we can use cabal-configure to generate the build plan:

    % make cabal-configure
    [...]
    Resolving dependencies...
    Build profile: -w ghc-8.10.7 -O1
    In order, the following would be built (use -v for more details):
     - Diff-0.4.1 (lib) (requires download & build)
     - OneTuple-0.3.1 (lib) (requires download & build)
    [...]

Once done, a list of required dependencies can generated:

    % make make-use-cabal
    USE_CABAL=   QuickCheck-2.12.6.1 \
            hashable-1.3.0.0 \
            integer-logarithms-1.0.3 \
    [...]

Haskell packages may contain revisions, just like FreeBSD ports.
Revisions can affect .cabal files only. Note additional version numbers
after the _ symbol. Put newly generated USE_CABAL list instead of an old
one.

Finally, distinfo needs to be regenerated to contain all the
distribution files:

    % make makesum
    => ShellCheck-0.6.0.tar.gz doesn't seem to exist in /usr/local/poudriere/ports/git/distfiles/cabal.
    => Attempting to fetch https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ShellCheck-0.6.0/ShellCheck-0.6.0.tar.gz
    ShellCheck-0.6.0.tar.gz                                136 kB  642 kBps    00s
    => QuickCheck-2.12.6.1/QuickCheck-2.12.6.1.tar.gz doesn't seem to exist in /usr/local/poudriere/ports/git/distfiles/cabal.
    => Attempting to fetch https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck-2.12.6.1/QuickCheck-2.12.6.1.tar.gz
    QuickCheck-2.12.6.1/QuickCheck-2.12.6.1.tar.gz          65 kB  361 kBps    00s
    [...]

The port is now ready for a test build and further adjustments like
creating a plist, writing a description, adding license information,
options, etc. as normal.

If you are not testing your port in a clean environment like with
Poudriere, remember to run make clean before any testing.

Some Haskell ports install various data files under share/${PORTNAME}.
For such cases special handling is required on the port side. The port
should define the CABAL_WRAPPER_SCRIPTS knob listing each executable
that is going to use data files. Moreover, in rare cases the program
being ported uses data files of other Haskell packages, in which case
the FOO_DATADIR_VARS comes to the rescue.

Example 65. Handling Data Files in a Haskell Port

devel/hs-profiteur is a Haskell application that generates a single-page
HTML with some content.

    PORTNAME= profiteur

    [...]

    USES=       cabal

    USE_CABAL=  OneTuple-0.3.1_2 \
            QuickCheck-2.14.2 \
            [...]

    .include <bsd.port.mk>

It installs HTML templates under share/profiteur, so we need to add
CABAL_WRAPPER_SCRIPTS knob:

    [...]

    USE_CABAL=  OneTuple-0.3.1_2 \
            QuickCheck-2.14.2 \
            [...]


    CABAL_WRAPPER_SCRIPTS=      ${CABAL_EXECUTABLES}

    .include <bsd.port.mk>

The program also tries to access the jquery.js file, which is a part of
js-jquery-3.3.1 Haskell package. For that file to be found, we need to
make the wrapper script to look for js-jquery data files in
share/profiteur too. We use profiteur_DATADIR_VARS for this:

    [...]

    CABAL_WRAPPER_SCRIPTS=      ${CABAL_EXECUTABLES}
    profiteur_DATADIR_VARS=     js-jquery

    .include <bsd.port.mk>

Now the port will install the actual binary into libexec/cabal/profiteur
and the script into bin/profiteur.

There is no easy way to find out a proper value for the FOO_DATADIR_VARS
knob apart from running the program and checking that everything works.
Luckily, the need to use FOO_DATADIR_VARS is very rare.

Another corner case when porting complex Haskell programs is the
presence of VCS dependencies in the cabal.project file.

Example 66. Porting Haskell Applications with VCS Dependencies

net-p2p/cardano-node is an extremely complex piece of software. In its
cabal.project there are a lot of blocks like this:

    [...]
    source-repository-package
      type: git
      location: https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-crypto
      tag: f73079303f663e028288f9f4a9e08bcca39a923e
    [...]

Dependencies of type source-repository-package are automatically pulled
in by cabal during the build process. Unfortunately, this makes use of
the network after the fetch stage. This is disallowed by the ports
framework. These sources need to be listed in the port’s Makefile. The
make-use-cabal helper target can make it easy for packages hosted on
GitHub. Running this target after the usual cabal-extract and
cabal-configure will produce not only the USE_CABAL knob, but also
GH_TUPLE:

    % make make-use-cabal
    USE_CABAL=   Diff-0.4.1 \
            Glob-0.10.2_3 \
            HUnit-1.6.2.0 \
            [...]

    GH_TUPLE=        input-output-hk:cardano-base:0f3a867493059e650cda69e20a5cbf1ace289a57:cardano_base/dist-newstyle/src/cardano-b_-c8db9876882556ed \
            input-output-hk:cardano-crypto:f73079303f663e028288f9f4a9e08bcca39a923e:cardano_crypto/dist-newstyle/src/cardano-c_-253fd88117badd8f \
            [...]

It might be useful to separate the GH_TUPLE items coming from
make-use-cabal from the other ones to make it easy to update the port:

    GH_TUPLE=   input-output-hk:cardano-base:0f3a867493059e650cda69e20a5cbf1ace289a57:cardano_base/dist-newstyle/src/cardano-b_-c8db9876882556ed \
            input-output-hk:cardano-crypto:f73079303f663e028288f9f4a9e08bcca39a923e:cardano_crypto/dist-newstyle/src/cardano-c_-253fd88117badd8f \
            [...]

    GH_TUPLE+=  bitcoin-core:secp256k1:ac83be33d0956faf6b7f61a60ab524ef7d6a473a:secp

Haskell ports with VCS dependencies also require the following hack for
the time being:

    BINARY_ALIAS=   git=true

6.6. Using GNU Autotools

If a port needs any of the GNU Autotools software, add USES=autoreconf.
See autoreconf for more information.

6.7. Using GNU gettext

6.7.1. Basic Usage

If the port requires gettext, set USES= gettext, and the port will
inherit a dependency on libintl.so from devel/gettext. Other values for
gettext usage are listed in USES=gettext.

A rather common case is a port using gettext and configure. Generally,
GNU configure should be able to locate gettext automatically.

    USES=  gettext
    GNU_CONFIGURE=  yes

If it ever fails to, hints at the location of gettext can be passed in
CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS using localbase as follows:

    USES=    gettext localbase:ldflags
    GNU_CONFIGURE=  yes

6.7.2. Optional Usage

Some software products allow for disabling NLS. For example, through
passing --disable-nls to configure. In that case, the port must use
gettext conditionally, depending on the status of the NLS option. For
ports of low to medium complexity, use this idiom:

    GNU_CONFIGURE=     yes

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=     NLS
    OPTIONS_SUB=        yes

    NLS_USES=       gettext
    NLS_CONFIGURE_ENABLE=   nls

    .include <bsd.port.mk>

Or using the older way of using options:

    GNU_CONFIGURE=     yes

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=     NLS

    .include <bsd.port.options.mk>

    .if ${PORT_OPTIONS:MNLS}
    USES+=          gettext
    PLIST_SUB+=     NLS=""
    .else
    CONFIGURE_ARGS+=    --disable-nls
    PLIST_SUB+=     NLS="@comment "
    .endif

    .include <bsd.port.mk>

The next item on the to-do list is to arrange so that the message
catalog files are included in the packing list conditionally. The
Makefile part of this task is already provided by the idiom. It is
explained in the section on advanced pkg-plist practices. In a nutshell,
each occurrence of %%NLS%% in pkg-plist will be replaced by "`@comment
" if NLS is disabled, or by a null string if NLS is enabled. Consequently, the lines prefixed by `%%NLS%%
will become mere comments in the final packing list if NLS is off;
otherwise the prefix will be just left out. Then insert %%NLS%% before
each path to a message catalog file in pkg-plist. For example:

    %%NLS%%share/locale/fr/LC_MESSAGES/foobar.mo
    %%NLS%%share/locale/no/LC_MESSAGES/foobar.mo

In high complexity cases, more advanced techniques may be needed, such
as dynamic packing list generation.

6.7.3. Handling Message Catalog Directories

There is a point to note about installing message catalog files. The
target directories for them, which reside under LOCALBASE/share/locale,
must not be created and removed by a port. The most popular languages
have their respective directories listed in
PORTSDIR/Templates/BSD.local.dist. The directories for many other
languages are governed by the devel/gettext port. Consult its pkg-plist
and see whether the port is going to install a message catalog file for
a unique language.

6.8. Using Perl

If MASTER_SITES is set to CPAN, the correct subdirectory is usually
selected automatically. If the default subdirectory is wrong,
CPAN/Module can be used to change it. MASTER_SITES can also be set to
the old MASTER_SITE_PERL_CPAN, then the preferred value of
MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR is the top-level hierarchy name. For example, the
recommended value for p5-Module-Name is Module. The top-level hierarchy
can be examined at cpan.org. This keeps the port working when the author
of the module changes.

The exception to this rule is when the relevant directory does not exist
or the distfile does not exist in that directory. In such case, using
author’s id as MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR is allowed. The CPAN:AUTHOR macro can
be used, which will be translated to the hashed author directory. For
example, CPAN:AUTHOR will be converted to authors/id/A/AU/AUTHOR.

When a port needs Perl support, it must set USES=perl5 with the optional
USE_PERL5 described in the perl5 USES description.

|                                   | not have an official website must |

|                                   | dependency declarations. Doing so |
|                                   | assumes that perl5.mk has been    |
|                                   | included, which is not always     |
|                                   | true. Ports depending on this     |
|                                   | port will have incorrect          |
|                                   | dependencies if this port’s files |
|                                   | move later in an upgrade. The     |
|                                   | right way to declare Perl module  |

|                                   | example below.                    |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Example 67. Perl Dependency Example

    p5-IO-Tee>=0.64:devel/p5-IO-Tee

For Perl ports that install manual pages, the macro PERL5_MAN3 and
PERL5_MAN1 can be used inside pkg-plist. For example,

    lib/perl5/5.14/man/man1/event.1.gz
    lib/perl5/5.14/man/man3/AnyEvent::I3.3.gz

can be replaced with

    %%PERL5_MAN1%%/event.1.gz
    %%PERL5_MAN3%%/AnyEvent::I3.3.gz

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | There are no PERL5_MAN_x_ macros  |
|                                   | for the other sections (x in 2    |
|                                   | and 4 to 9) because those get     |
|                                   | installed in the regular          |
|                                   | directories.                      |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Example 68. A Port Which Only Requires Perl to Build

As the default USE_PERL5 value is build and run, set it to:

    USES=     perl5
    USE_PERL5=  build

Example 69. A Port Which Also Requires Perl to Patch

From time to time, using sed(1) for patching is not enough. When using
perl(1) is easier, use:

    USES=       perl5
    USE_PERL5=  patch build run

Example 70. A Perl Module Which Needs ExtUtils::MakeMaker to Build

Most Perl modules come with a Makefile.PL configure script. In this
case, set:

    USES=      perl5
    USE_PERL5=  configure

Example 71. A Perl Module Which Needs Module::Build to Build

When a Perl module comes with a Build.PL configure script, it can
require Module::Build, in which case, set

    USES=       perl5
    USE_PERL5=  modbuild

If it instead requires Module::Build::Tiny, set

    USES=       perl5
    USE_PERL5=  modbuildtiny

6.9. Using X11

6.9.1. X.Org Components

The X11 implementation available in The Ports Collection is X.Org. If
the application depends on X components, add USES= xorg and set USE_XORG
to the list of required components. A full list can be found in xorg.

The Mesa Project is an effort to provide free OpenGL implementation. To
specify a dependency on various components of this project, use USES= gl
and USE_GL. See gl for a full list of available components. For
backwards compatibility, the value of yes maps to glu.

Example 72. USE_XORG Example

    USES=     gl xorg
    USE_GL=     glu
    USE_XORG=   xrender xft xkbfile xt xaw

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| USES= imake                       | The port uses imake.              |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| XMKMF                             | Set to the path of xmkmf if not   |
|                                   | in the PATH. Defaults to          |
|                                   | xmkmf -a.                         |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

: Table 15. Variables for Ports That Use X

Example 73. Using X11-Related Variables

    # Use some X11 libraries
    USES=       xorg
    USE_XORG=   x11 xpm

6.9.2. Ports That Require Motif

If the port requires a Motif library, define USES= motif in the
Makefile. Default Motif implementation is x11-toolkits/open-motif. Users
can choose x11-toolkits/lesstif instead by setting WANT_LESSTIF in their
make.conf. Similarly x11-toolkits/open-motif-devel can be chosen by
setting WANT_OPEN_MOTIF_DEVEL in make.conf.

MOTIFLIB will be set by motif.mk to reference the appropriate Motif
library. Please patch the source of the port to use ${MOTIFLIB} wherever
the Motif library is referenced in the original Makefile or Imakefile.

There are two common cases:

-   If the port refers to the Motif library as -lXm in its Makefile or
    Imakefile, substitute ${MOTIFLIB} for it.

-   If the port uses XmClientLibs in its Imakefile, change it to
    ${MOTIFLIB} ${XTOOLLIB} ${XLIB}.

Note that MOTIFLIB (usually) expands to -L/usr/local/lib -lXm -lXp or
/usr/local/lib/libXm.a, so there is no need to add -L or -l in front.

6.9.3. X11 Fonts

If the port installs fonts for the X Window System, put them in
LOCALBASE/lib/X11/fonts/local.

6.9.4. Getting a Fake DISPLAY with Xvfb

Some applications require a working X11 display for compilation to
succeed. This poses a problem for machines that operate headless. When
this variable is used, the build infrastructure will start the virtual
framebuffer X server. The working DISPLAY is then passed to the build.
See USES=display for the possible arguments.

    USES=   display

6.9.5. Desktop Entries

Desktop entries (a Freedesktop standard) provide a way to automatically
adjust desktop features when a new program is installed, without
requiring user intervention. For example, newly-installed programs
automatically appear in the application menus of compatible desktop
environments. Desktop entries originated in the GNOME desktop
environment, but are now a standard and also work with KDE and Xfce.
This bit of automation provides a real benefit to the user, and desktop
entries are encouraged for applications which can be used in a desktop
environment.

6.9.5.1. Using Predefined .desktop Files

Ports that include predefined *.desktop must include those files in
pkg-plist and install them in the $LOCALBASE/share/applications
directory. The INSTALL_DATA macro is useful for installing these files.

6.9.5.2. Updating Desktop Database

If a port has a MimeType entry in its portname.desktop, the desktop
database must be updated after install and deinstall. To do this, define
USES= desktop-file-utils.

6.9.5.3. Creating Desktop Entries with DESKTOP_ENTRIES

Desktop entries can be easily created for applications by using
DESKTOP_ENTRIES. A file named name.desktop will be created, installed,
and added to pkg-plist automatically. Syntax is:

    DESKTOP_ENTRIES=   "NAME" "COMMENT" "ICON" "COMMAND" "CATEGORY" StartupNotify

The list of possible categories is available on the Freedesktop website.
StartupNotify indicates whether the application is compatible with
startup notifications. These are typically a graphic indicator like a
clock that appear at the mouse pointer, menu, or panel to give the user
an indication when a program is starting. A program that is compatible
with startup notifications clears the indicator after it has started.
Programs that are not compatible with startup notifications would never
clear the indicator (potentially confusing and infuriating the user),
and must have StartupNotify set to false so the indicator is not shown
at all.

Example:

    DESKTOP_ENTRIES= "ToME" "Roguelike game based on JRR Tolkien's work" \
                "${DATADIR}/xtra/graf/tome-128.png" \
                "tome -v -g" "Application;Game;RolePlaying;" \
                false

6.10. Using GNOME

6.10.1. Introduction

This chapter explains the GNOME framework as used by ports. The
framework can be loosely divided into the base components, GNOME desktop
components, and a few special macros that simplify the work of port
maintainers.

6.10.2. Using USE_GNOME

Adding this variable to the port allows the use of the macros and
components defined in bsd.gnome.mk. The code in bsd.gnome.mk adds the
needed build-time, run-time or library dependencies or the handling of
special files. GNOME applications under FreeBSD use the USE_GNOME
infrastructure. Include all the needed components as a space-separated
list. The USE_GNOME components are divided into these virtual lists:
basic components, GNOME 3 components and legacy components. If the port
needs only GTK3 libraries, this is the shortest way to define it:

    USE_GNOME=  gtk30

USE_GNOME components automatically add the dependencies they need.
Please see GNOME Components for an exhaustive list of all USE_GNOME
components and which other components they imply and their dependencies.

Here is an example Makefile for a GNOME port that uses many of the
techniques outlined in this document. Please use it as a guide for
creating new ports.

    PORTNAME=    regexxer
    DISTVERSION=    0.10
    CATEGORIES= devel textproc gnome
    MASTER_SITES=   GNOME

    MAINTAINER= kwm@FreeBSD.org
    COMMENT=    Interactive tool for performing search and replace operations
    WWW=        http://regexxer.sourceforge.net/

    USES=       gettext gmake localbase:ldflags pathfix pkgconfig tar:xz
    GNU_CONFIGURE=  yes
    USE_GNOME=  gnomeprefix intlhack gtksourceviewmm3

    GLIB_SCHEMAS=   org.regexxer.gschema.xml

    .include <bsd.port.mk>

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | The USE_GNOME macro without any   |
|                                   | arguments does not add any        |
|                                   | dependencies to the port.         |
|                                   | USE_GNOME cannot be set after     |
|                                   | bsd.port.pre.mk.                  |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

6.10.3. Variables

This section explains which macros are available and how they are used.
Like they are used in the above example. The GNOME Components has a more
in-depth explanation. USE_GNOME has to be set for these macros to be of
use.

GLIB_SCHEMAS

    List of all the glib schema files the port installs. The macro will
    add the files to the port plist and handle the registration of these
    files on install and deinstall.

    The glib schema files are written in XML and end with the
    gschema.xml extension. They are installed in the
    share/glib-2.0/schemas/ directory. These schema files contain all
    application config values with their default settings. The actual
    database used by the applications is built by glib-compile-schema,
    which is run by the GLIB_SCHEMAS macro.

        GLIB_SCHEMAS=foo.gschema.xml

    +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
    |                                   | Do not add glib schemas to the    |
    |                                   | pkg-plist. If they are listed in  |
    |                                   | pkg-plist, they will not be       |
    |                                   | registered and the applications   |
    |                                   | might not work properly.          |
    +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

GCONF_SCHEMAS

    List all the gconf schema files. The macro will add the schema files
    to the port plist and will handle their registration on install and
    deinstall.

    GConf is the XML-based database that virtually all GNOME
    applications use for storing their settings. These files are
    installed into the etc/gconf/schemas directory. This database is
    defined by installed schema files that are used to generate
    %gconf.xml key files. For each schema file installed by the port,
    there must be an entry in the Makefile:

        GCONF_SCHEMAS=my_app.schemas my_app2.schemas my_app3.schemas

    +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
    |                                   | Gconf schemas are listed in the   |
    |                                   | GCONF_SCHEMAS macro rather than   |
    |                                   | pkg-plist. If they are listed in  |
    |                                   | pkg-plist, they will not be       |
    |                                   | registered and the applications   |
    |                                   | might not work properly.          |
    +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

INSTALLS_OMF

    Open Source Metadata Framework (OMF) files are commonly used by
    GNOME 2 applications. These files contain the application help file
    information, and require special processing by ScrollKeeper/rarian.
    To properly register OMF files when installing GNOME applications
    from packages, make sure that omf files are listed in pkg-plist and
    that the port Makefile has INSTALLS_OMF defined:

        INSTALLS_OMF=yes

    When set, bsd.gnome.mk automatically scans pkg-plist and adds
    appropriate @exec and @unexec directives for each .omf to track in
    the OMF registration database.

6.11. GNOME Components

For further help with a GNOME port, look at some of the existing ports
for examples. The FreeBSD GNOME page has contact information if more
help is needed. The components are divided into GNOME components that
are currently in use and legacy components. If the component supports
argument, they are listed between parenthesis in the description. The
first is the default. "Both" is shown if the component defaults to
adding to both build and run dependencies.

6.12.1. Ports That Require Qt

The Ports Collection provides support for Qt 5 and Qt 6 with USES+=qt:5
and USES+=qt:6 respectively. Set USE_QT to the list of required Qt
components (libraries, tools, plugins).

The Qt framework exports a number of variables which can be used by
ports, some of them listed below:

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| QMAKE                             | Full path to qmake binary.        |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| LRELEASE                          | Full path to lrelease utility.    |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| MOC                               | Full path to moc.                 |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| RCC                               | Full path to rcc.                 |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| UIC                               | Full path to uic.                 |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| QT_INCDIR                         | Qt include directory.             |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| QT_LIBDIR                         | Qt libraries path.                |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| QT_PLUGINDIR                      | Qt plugins path.                  |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

: Table 20. Variables Provided to Ports That Use Qt

6.12.2. Component Selection

Individual Qt tool and library dependencies must be specified in USE_QT.
Every component can be suffixed with _build or _run, the suffix
indicating whether the dependency on the component is at buildtime or
runtime. If unsuffixed, the component will be depended on at both build-
and runtime. Usually, library components are specified unsuffixed, tool
components are mostly specified with the _build suffix and plugin
components are specified with the _run suffix. The most commonly used
components are listed below (all available components are listed in
_USE_QT_ALL, which is generated from _USE_QT_COMMON and _USE_QT[56]_ONLY
in /usr/ports/Mk/Uses/qt.mk):

: Table 23. Available Qt Plugin Components

Example 74. Selecting Qt 5 Components

In this example, the ported application uses the Qt 5 graphical user
interface library, the Qt 5 core library, all of the Qt 5 code
generation tools and Qt 5’s Makefile generator. Since the gui library
implies a dependency on the core library, core does not need to be
specified. The Qt 5 code generation tools moc, uic and rcc, as well as
the Makefile generator qmake are only needed at buildtime, thus they are
specified with the _build suffix:

    USES= qt:5
    USE_QT= gui buildtools_build qmake_build

6.12.3. Using qmake

If the application provides a qmake project file (*.pro), define
USES= qmake along with USE_QT. USES= qmake already implies a build
dependency on qmake, therefore the qmake component can be omitted from
USE_QT. Similar to CMake, qmake supports out-of-source builds, which can
be enabled by specifying the outsource argument (see USES= qmake
example). Also see Possible Arguments for USES= qmake.

: Table 25. Variables for Ports That Use qmake

When using USES= qmake, these settings are deployed:

    CONFIGURE_ARGS+=    --with-qt-includes=${QT_INCDIR} \
                --with-qt-libraries=${QT_LIBDIR} \
                --with-extra-libs=${LOCALBASE}/lib \
                --with-extra-includes=${LOCALBASE}/include

    CONFIGURE_ENV+= QTDIR="${QT_PREFIX}" QMAKE="${QMAKE}" \
            MOC="${MOC}" RCC="${RCC}" UIC="${UIC}" \
            QMAKESPEC="${QMAKESPEC}"

    PLIST_SUB+= QT_INCDIR=${QT_INCDIR_REL} \
            QT_LIBDIR=${QT_LIBDIR_REL} \
            QT_PLUGINDIR=${QT_PLUGINDIR_REL}

Some configure scripts do not support the arguments above. To suppress
modification of CONFIGURE_ENV and CONFIGURE_ARGS, set
USES= qmake:no_env.

Example 75. USES= qmake Example

This snippet demonstrates the use of qmake for a Qt 5 port:

    USES=  qmake:outsource qt:5
    USE_QT= buildtools_build

Qt applications are often written to be cross-platform and often
X11/Unix is not the platform they are developed on, which in turn leads
to certain loose ends, like:

-   Missing additional include paths. Many applications come with system
    tray icon support, but neglect to look for includes and/or libraries
    in the X11 directories. To add directories to `qmake’s include and
    library search paths via the command line, use:

        QMAKE_ARGS+= INCLUDEPATH+=${LOCALBASE}/include \
                LIBS+=-L${LOCALBASE}/lib

-   Bogus installation paths. Sometimes data such as icons or .desktop
    files are by default installed into directories which are not
    scanned by XDG-compatible applications. editors/texmaker is an
    example for this - look at patch-texmaker.pro in the files directory
    of that port for a template on how to remedy this directly in the
    qmake project file.

6.13. Using KDE

6.13.1. KDE Variable Definitions

If the application depends on KDE, set USES+=kde:5 and USE_KDE to the
list of required components. _build and _run suffixes can be used to
force components dependency type (for example, baseapps_run). If no
suffix is set, a default dependency type will be used. To force both
types, add the component twice with both suffixes (for example,
ecm_build ecm_run). Available components are listed below (up-to-date
components are also listed in /usr/ports/Mk/Uses/kde.mk):

: Table 26. Available KDE Components

Example 76. USE_KDE Example

This is a simple example for a KDE port. USES= cmake instructs the port
to utilize CMake, a configuration tool widely used by KDE projects (see
Using cmake for detailed usage). USE_KDE brings dependency on KDE
libraries. Required KDE components and other dependencies can be
determined through the configure log. USE_KDE does not imply USE_QT. If
a port requires some Qt components, specify them in USE_QT.

    USES=     cmake kde:5 qt:5
    USE_KDE=    ecm
    USE_QT=     core buildtools_build qmake_build

6.14. Using LXQt

Applications depending on LXQt should set USES+= lxqt and set USE_LXQT
to the list of required components from the table below

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Name                              | Description                       |

: Table 27. Available LXQt Components

Example 77. USE_LXQT Example

This is a simple example, USE_LXQT adds a dependency on LXQt libraries.
Required LXQt components and other dependencies can be determined from
the configure log.

    USES=   cmake lxqt qt:5 tar:xz
    USE_QT=     core dbus widgets buildtools_build qmake_build
    USE_LXQT=   buildtools libfmqt

6.15. Using Java

6.15.1. Variable Definitions

If the port needs a Java™ Development Kit (JDK™) to either build, run or
even extract the distfile, then define USE_JAVA.

There are several JDKs in the ports collection, from various vendors,
and in several versions. If the port must use a particular version,
specify it using the JAVA_VERSION variable. The most current version is
java/openjdk18, with java/openjdk17, java/openjdk16, java/openjdk15,
java/openjdk14, java/openjdk13, java/openjdk12, java/openjdk11,
java/openjdk8, and java/openjdk7 also available.

: Table 29. Variables Provided to Ports That Use Java

Use the java-debug make target to get information for debugging the
port. It will display the value of many of the previously listed
variables.

Additionally, these constants are defined so all Java ports may be
installed in a consistent way:

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Constant                          | Value                             |
+===================================+===================================+
| JAVASHAREDIR                      | The base directory for everything |
|                                   | related to Java. Default:         |
|                                   | ${PREFIX}/share/java.             |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| JAVAJARDIR                        | The directory where JAR files is  |
|                                   | installed. Default:               |
|                                   | ${JAVASHAREDIR}/classes.          |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| JAVALIBDIR                        | The directory where JAR files     |
|                                   | installed by other ports are      |
|                                   | located. Default:                 |
|                                   | ${LOCALBASE}/share/java/classes.  |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

: Table 30. Constants Defined for Ports That Use Java

The related entries are defined in both PLIST_SUB (documented in
Changing pkg-plist Based on Make Variables) and SUB_LIST.

6.15.2. Building with Ant

When the port is to be built using Apache Ant, it has to define USE_ANT.
Ant is thus considered to be the sub-make command. When no do-build
target is defined by the port, a default one will be set that runs Ant
according to MAKE_ENV, MAKE_ARGS and ALL_TARGET. This is similar to the
USES= gmake mechanism, which is documented in Building Mechanisms.

6.15.3. Best Practices

When porting a Java library, the port has to install the JAR file(s) in
${JAVAJARDIR}, and everything else under ${JAVASHAREDIR}/${PORTNAME}
(except for the documentation, see below). To reduce the packing file
size, reference the JAR file(s) directly in the Makefile. Use this
statement (where myport.jar is the name of the JAR file installed as
part of the port):

    PLIST_FILES+=    ${JAVAJARDIR}/myport.jar

When porting a Java application, the port usually installs everything
under a single directory (including its JAR dependencies). The use of
${JAVASHAREDIR}/${PORTNAME} is strongly encouraged in this regard. It is
up the porter to decide whether the port installs the additional JAR
dependencies under this directory or uses the already installed ones
(from ${JAVAJARDIR}).

When porting a Java™ application that requires an application server
such as www/tomcat7 to run the service, it is quite common for a vendor
to distribute a .war. A .war is a Web application ARchive and is
extracted when called by the application. Avoid adding a .war to
pkg-plist. It is not considered best practice. An application server
will expand war archive, but not clean it up properly if the port is
removed. A more desirable way of working with this file is to extract
the archive, then install the files, and lastly add these files to
pkg-plist.

    TOMCATDIR= ${LOCALBASE}/apache-tomcat-7.0
    WEBAPPDIR=  myapplication

    post-extract:
        @${MKDIR} ${WRKDIR}/${PORTDIRNAME}
        @${TAR} xf ${WRKDIR}/myapplication.war -C ${WRKDIR}/${PORTDIRNAME}

    do-install:
        cd ${WRKDIR} && \
        ${INSTALL} -d -o ${WWWOWN} -g ${WWWGRP} ${TOMCATDIR}/webapps/${PORTDIRNAME}
        cd ${WRKDIR}/${PORTDIRNAME} && ${COPYTREE_SHARE} \* ${WEBAPPDIR}/${PORTDIRNAME}

Regardless of the type of port (library or application), the additional
documentation is installed in the same location as for any other port.
The Javadoc tool is known to produce a different set of files depending
on the version of the JDK that is used. For ports that do not enforce
the use of a particular JDK, it is therefore a complex task to specify
the packing list (pkg-plist). This is one reason why porters are
strongly encouraged to use PORTDOCS. Moreover, even if the set of files
that will be generated by javadoc can be predicted, the size of the
resulting pkg-plist advocates for the use of PORTDOCS.

The default value for DATADIR is ${PREFIX}/share/${PORTNAME}. It is a
good idea to override DATADIR to ${JAVASHAREDIR}/${PORTNAME} for Java
ports. Indeed, DATADIR is automatically added to PLIST_SUB (documented
in Changing pkg-plist Based on Make Variables) so use %%DATADIR%%
directly in pkg-plist.

As for the choice of building Java ports from source or directly
installing them from a binary distribution, there is no defined policy
at the time of writing. However, people from the FreeBSD Java Project
encourage porters to have their ports built from source whenever it is a
trivial task.

All the features that have been presented in this section are
implemented in bsd.java.mk. If the port needs more sophisticated Java
support, please first have a look at the bsd.java.mk Git log as it
usually takes some time to document the latest features. Then, if the
needed support that is lacking would be beneficial to many other Java
ports, feel free to discuss it on the freebsd-java.

Although there is a java category for PRs, it refers to the JDK porting
effort from the FreeBSD Java project. Therefore, submit the Java port in
the ports category as for any other port, unless the issue is related to
either a JDK implementation or bsd.java.mk.

Similarly, there is a defined policy regarding the CATEGORIES of a Java
port, which is detailed in Categorization.

: Table 31. Variables for Ports That Use Apache

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| MODULENAME                        | Name of the module. Default value |

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

: Table 32. Useful Variables for Porting Apache Modules

6.16.2. Web Applications

Web applications must be installed into PREFIX/www/appname. This path is
available both in Makefile and in pkg-plist as WWWDIR, and the path
relative to PREFIX is available in Makefile as WWWDIR_REL.

The user and group of web server process are available as WWWOWN and
WWWGRP, in case the ownership of some files needs to be changed. The
default values of both are www. Use WWWOWN?= myuser and WWWGRP?= mygroup
if the port needs different values. This allows the user to override
them easily.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Use WWWOWN and WWWGRP sparingly.  |
|                                   | Remember that every file the web  |
|                                   | server can write to is a security |
|                                   | risk waiting to happen.           |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Do not depend on Apache unless the web app explicitly needs Apache.
Respect that users may wish to run a web application on a web server
other than Apache.

6.16.3. PHP

PHP web applications declare their dependency on it with USES=php. See
php for more information.

6.16.4. PEAR Modules

Porting PEAR modules is a very simple process.

Add USES=pear to the port’s Makefile. The framework will install the
relevant files in the right places and automatically generate the plist
at install time.

Example 78. Example Makefile for PEAR Class

    PORTNAME=       Date
    DISTVERSION=    1.4.3
    CATEGORIES= devel www pear

    MAINTAINER= example@domain.com
    COMMENT=    PEAR Date and Time Zone Classes
    WWW=        https://pear.php.net/package/Date/

    USES=   pear

    .include <bsd.port.mk>

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | PEAR modules will automatically   |
|                                   | be flavorized using PHP flavors.  |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | If a non default PEAR_CHANNEL is  |
|                                   | used, the build and run-time      |
|                                   | dependencies will automatically   |
|                                   | be added.                         |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | PEAR modules do not need to       |
|                                   | defined PKGNAMESUFFIX it is       |
|                                   | automatically filled in using     |
|                                   | PEAR_PKGNAMEPREFIX. If a port     |
|                                   | needs to add to PKGNAMEPREFIX, it |
|                                   | must also use PEAR_PKGNAMEPREFIX  |
|                                   | to differentiate between          |
|                                   | different flavors.                |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

6.16.4.1. Horde Modules

In the same way, porting Horde modules is a simple process.

Add USES=horde to the port’s Makefile. The framework will install the
relevant files in the right places and automatically generate the plist
at install time.

The USE_HORDE_BUILD and USE_HORDE_RUN variables can be used to add
buildtime and runtime dependencies on other Horde modules. See
Mk/Uses/horde.mk for a complete list of available modules.

Example 79. Example Makefile for Horde Module

    PORTNAME= Horde_Core

6.17. Using Python

The Ports Collection supports parallel installation of multiple Python
versions. Ports must use a correct python interpreter, according to the
user-settable PYTHON_VERSION. Most prominently, this means replacing the
path to python executable in scripts with the value of PYTHON_CMD.

Ports that install files under PYTHON_SITELIBDIR must use the pyXY-
package name prefix, so their package name embeds the version of Python
they are installed into.

    PKGNAMEPREFIX=    ${PYTHON_PKGNAMEPREFIX}

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| USES=python                       | The port needs Python. The        |
|                                   | minimal required version can be   |
|                                   | specified with values such as     |
|                                   | 3.10+. Version ranges can also be |
|                                   | specified by separating two       |
|                                   | version numbers with a dash:      |
|                                   | USES=python:3.8-3.9. Note that    |
|                                   | USES=python does not cover Python |
|                                   | 2.7, it needs to be requested     |
|                                   | explicitly with USES=python:2.7+. |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| USE_PYTHON=distutils              | Use Python distutils for          |
|                                   | configuring, compiling, and       |
|                                   | installing. This is required when |
|                                   | the port comes with setup.py.     |
|                                   | This overrides the do-build and   |
|                                   | do-install targets and may also   |
|                                   | override do-configure if          |
|                                   | GNU_CONFIGURE is not defined.     |
|                                   | Additionally, it implies          |
|                                   | USE_PYTHON=flavors.               |

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| USE_PYTHON=concurrent             | The port will use an unique       |
|                                   | prefix, typically                 |
|                                   | PYTHON_PKGNAMEPREFIX for certain  |
|                                   | directories, such as EXAMPLESDIR  |
|                                   | and DOCSDIR and also will append  |
|                                   | a suffix, the python version from |
|                                   | PYTHON_VER, to binaries and       |
|                                   | scripts to be installed. This     |
|                                   | allows ports to be installed for  |
|                                   | different Python versions at the  |
|                                   | same time, which otherwise would  |
|                                   | install conflicting files.        |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| USE_PYTHON=flavors                | The port does not use distutils   |
|                                   | but still supports multiple       |
|                                   | Python versions. FLAVORS will be  |
|                                   | set to the supported Python       |
|                                   | versions. See USES=python and     |

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| USE_PYTHON=optsuffix              | If the current Python version is  |
|                                   | not the default version, the port |
|                                   | will gain                         |

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Example 80. Makefile for a Simple Python Module

    PORTNAME=   sample
    DISTVERSION=    1.2.3
    CATEGORIES= devel

    MAINTAINER= john@doe.tld
    COMMENT=    Python sample module
    WWW=        https://pypi.org/project/sample/

    RUN_DEPENDS=    ${PYTHON_PKGNAMEPREFIX}six>0:devel/py-six@${PY_FLAVOR}

    USES=       python
    USE_PYTHON= autoplist distutils

    .include <bsd.port.mk>

Some Python applications claim to have DESTDIR support (which would be
required for staging) but it is broken (Mailman up to 2.1.16, for
instance). This can be worked around by recompiling the scripts. This
can be done, for example, in the post-build target. Assuming the Python
scripts are supposed to reside in PYTHONPREFIX_SITELIBDIR after
installation, this solution can be applied:

    (cd ${STAGEDIR}${PREFIX} \
      && ${PYTHON_CMD} ${PYTHON_LIBDIR}/compileall.py \
       -d ${PREFIX} -f ${PYTHONPREFIX_SITELIBDIR:S;${PREFIX}/;;})

This recompiles the sources with a path relative to the stage directory,
and prepends the value of PREFIX to the file name recorded in the
byte-compiled output file by -d. -f is required to force recompilation,
and the :S;${PREFIX}/;; strips prefixes from the value of
PYTHONPREFIX_SITELIBDIR to make it relative to PREFIX.

6.18. Using Tcl/Tk

The Ports Collection supports parallel installation of multiple Tcl/Tk
versions. Ports should try to support at least the default Tcl/Tk
version and higher with USES=tcl. It is possible to specify the desired
version of tcl by appending :_xx_, for example, USES=tcl:85.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| TCL_VER                           | chosen major.minor version of Tcl |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| TCLSH                             | full path of the Tcl interpreter  |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| TCL_LIBDIR                        | path of the Tcl libraries         |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| TCL_INCLUDEDIR                    | path of the Tcl C header files    |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| TK_VER                            | chosen major.minor version of Tk  |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| WISH                              | full path of the Tk interpreter   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| TK_LIBDIR                         | path of the Tk libraries          |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| TK_INCLUDEDIR                     | path of the Tk C header files     |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Tcl/Tk

See the USES=tcl and USES=tk of Using USES Macros for a full description
of those variables. A complete list of those variables is available in
/usr/ports/Mk/Uses/tcl.mk.

6.19. Using SDL

USE_SDL is used to autoconfigure the dependencies for ports which use an
SDL based library like devel/sdl12 and graphics/sdl_image.

These SDL libraries for version 1.2 are recognized:

-   sdl: devel/sdl12

-   console: devel/sdl_console

-   gfx: graphics/sdl_gfx

-   image: graphics/sdl_image

-   mixer: audio/sdl_mixer

-   mm: devel/sdlmm

-   net: net/sdl_net

-   pango: x11-toolkits/sdl_pango

-   sound: audio/sdl_sound

-   ttf: graphics/sdl_ttf

These SDL libraries for version 2.0 are recognized:

-   sdl: devel/sdl20

-   gfx: graphics/sdl2_gfx

-   image: graphics/sdl2_image

-   mixer: audio/sdl2_mixer

-   net: net/sdl2_net

-   ttf: graphics/sdl2_ttf

Therefore, if a port has a dependency on net/sdl_net and
audio/sdl_mixer, the syntax will be:

    USE_SDL=   net mixer

The dependency devel/sdl12, which is required by net/sdl_net and
audio/sdl_mixer, is automatically added as well.

Using USE_SDL with entries for SDL 1.2, it will automatically:

-   Add a dependency on sdl12-config to BUILD_DEPENDS

-   Add the variable SDL_CONFIG to CONFIGURE_ENV

-   Add the dependencies of the selected libraries to LIB_DEPENDS

Using USE_SDL with entries for SDL 2.0, it will automatically:

-   Add a dependency on sdl2-config to BUILD_DEPENDS

-   Add the variable SDL2_CONFIG to CONFIGURE_ENV

-   Add the dependencies of the selected libraries to LIB_DEPENDS

6.20. Using wxWidgets

This section describes the status of the wxWidgets libraries in the
ports tree and its integration with the ports system.

6.20.1. Introduction

There are many versions of the wxWidgets libraries which conflict
between them (install files under the same name). In the ports tree this
problem has been solved by installing each version under a different
name using version number suffixes.

The obvious disadvantage of this is that each application has to be
modified to find the expected version. Fortunately, most of the
applications call the wx-config script to determine the necessary
compiler and linker flags. The script is named differently for every
available version. Majority of applications respect an environment
variable, or accept a configure argument, to specify which wx-config
script to call. Otherwise they have to be patched.

6.20.2. Version Selection

To make the port use a specific version of wxWidgets there are two
variables available for defining (if only one is defined the other will
be set to a default value):

+----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+
| Variable             | Description          | Default value         |
+======================+======================+=======================+
| USE_WX               | List of versions the | All available         |
|                      | port can use         | versions              |
+----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+
| USE_WX_NOT           | List of versions the | None                  |
|                      | port cannot use      |                       |
+----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+

Example 81. Selecting wxWidgets Components

This fragment corresponds to a port which uses wxWidgets version 2.4 and
its contributed libraries.

    USE_WX=       2.8
    WX_COMPS=   wx contrib

6.20.4. Detecting Installed Versions

To detect an installed version, define WANT_WX. If it is not set to a
specific version then the components will have a version suffix. HAVE_WX
will be filled after detection.

Example 82. Detecting Installed wxWidgets Versions and Components

This fragment can be used in a port that uses wxWidgets if it is
installed, or an option is selected.

    WANT_WX= yes

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

6.20.7. Additional configure Arguments

Some GNU configure scripts cannot find wxWidgets with just the WX_CONFIG
environment variable set, requiring additional arguments. WX_CONF_ARGS
can be used for provide them.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Possible value                    | Resulting argument                |
+===================================+===================================+

6.21. Using Lua

This section describes the status of the Lua libraries in the ports tree
and its integration with the ports system.

6.21.1. Introduction

There are many versions of the Lua libraries and corresponding
interpreters, which conflict between them (install files under the same
name). In the ports tree this problem has been solved by installing each
version under a different name using version number suffixes.

The obvious disadvantage of this is that each application has to be
modified to find the expected version. But it can be solved by adding
some additional flags to the compiler and linker.

Applications that use Lua should normally build for just one version.
However, loadable modules for Lua are built in a separate flavor for
each Lua version that they support, and dependencies on such modules
should specify the flavor using the @${LUA_FLAVOR} suffix on the port
origin.

6.21.2. Version Selection

A port using Lua should have a line of this form:

    USES=   lua

If a specific version of Lua, or range of versions, is needed, it can be
specified as a parameter in the form XY (which may be used multiple
times), XY+, -XY, or XY-ZA. The default version of Lua as set via
DEFAULT_VERSIONS will be used if it falls in the requested range,
otherwise the closest requested version to the default will be used. For
example:

    USES=    lua:52-53

Note that no attempt is made to adjust the version selection based on
the presence of any already-installed Lua version.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | The XY+ form of version           |
|                                   | specification should not be used  |
|                                   | without careful consideration;    |
|                                   | the Lua API changes to some       |
|                                   | extent in every version, and      |
|                                   | configuration tools like CMake or |
|                                   | Autoconf will often fail to work  |
|                                   | on future versions of Lua until   |
|                                   | updated to do so.                 |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

6.21.3. Configuration and Compiler flags

Software that uses Lua may have been written to auto-detect the Lua
version in use. In general ports should override this assumption, and
force the use of the specific Lua version selected as described above.
Depending on the software being ported, this might require any or all
of:

-   Using LUA_VER as part of a parameter to the software’s configuration
    script via CONFIGURE_ARGS or CONFIGURE_ENV (or equivalent for other
    build systems);

-   Adding -I${LUA_INCDIR}, -L${LUA_LIBDIR}, and -llua-${LUA_VER} to
    CFLAGS, LDFLAGS, LIBS respectively as appropriate;

-   Patch the software’s configuration or build files to select the
    correct version.

6.21.4. Version Flavors

A port which installs a Lua module (rather than an application that
simply makes use of Lua) should build a separate flavor for each
supported Lua version. This is done by adding the module parameter:

    USES=   lua:module

A version number or range of versions can be specified as well; use a
comma to separate parameters.

Since each flavor must have a different package name, the variable
LUA_PKGNAMEPREFIX is provided which will be set to an appropriate value;
the intended usage is:

    PKGNAMEPREFIX=   ${LUA_PKGNAMEPREFIX}

Module ports should normally install files only to LUA_MODLIBDIR,
LUA_MODSHAREDIR, LUA_DOCSDIR, and LUA_EXAMPLESDIR, all of which are set
up to refer to version-specific subdirectories. Installing any other
files must be done with care to avoid conflicts between versions.

A port (other than a Lua module) which wishes to build a separate
package for each Lua version should use the flavors parameter:

    USES=   lua:flavors

This operates the same way as the module parameter described above, but
without the assumption that the package should be documented as a Lua
module (so LUA_DOCSDIR and LUA_EXAMPLESDIR are not defined by default).
However, the port may choose to define LUA_DOCSUBDIR as a suitable
subdirectory name (usually the port’s PORTNAME as long as this does not
conflict with the PORTNAME of any module), in which case the framework
will define both LUA_DOCSDIR and LUA_EXAMPLESDIR.

As with module ports, a flavored port should avoid installing files that
would conflict between versions. Typically this is done by adding
LUA_VER_STR as a suffix to program names (e.g. using uniquefiles), and
otherwise using either LUA_VER or LUA_VER_STR as part of any other files
or subdirectories used outside of LUA_MODLIBDIR and LUA_MODSHAREDIR.

These variables are available in the port.

    USES=       lua:module

    DOCSDIR=    ${LUA_DOCSDIR}

    .include <bsd.port.mk>

6.22. Using iconv

FreeBSD has a native iconv in the operating system.

For software that needs iconv, define USES=iconv.

When a port defines USES=iconv, these variables will be available:

+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| Variable name   | Purpose         | Port iconv      | Base iconv      |
|                 |                 | (when using     |                 |
|                 |                 | WCHAR_T or      |                 |
|                 |                 | //TRANSLIT      |                 |
|                 |                 | extensions)     |                 |
+=================+=================+=================+=================+
| ICONV_CMD       | Directory where | ${LOCAL         | /usr/bin/iconv  |
|                 | the iconv       | BASE}/bin/iconv |                 |
|                 | binary resides  |                 |                 |
+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| ICONV_LIB       | ld argument to  | -liconv         | (empty)         |
|                 | link to         |                 |                 |
|                 | libiconv (if    |                 |                 |
|                 | needed)         |                 |                 |
+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| ICONV_PREFIX    | Directory where | ${LOCALBASE}    | /usr            |
|                 | the iconv       |                 |                 |
|                 | implementation  |                 |                 |
|                 | resides (useful |                 |                 |
|                 | for configure   |                 |                 |
|                 | scripts)        |                 |                 |
+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| ICON            | Preconstructed  | --wit           | (empty)         |
| V_CONFIGURE_ARG | configure       | h-libiconv-pref |                 |
|                 | argument for    | ix=${LOCALBASE} |                 |
|                 | configure       |                 |                 |
|                 | scripts         |                 |                 |
+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| ICONV           | Preconstructed  | --with-libico   | (empty)         |
| _CONFIGURE_BASE | configure       | nv=${LOCALBASE} |                 |
|                 | argument for    |                 |                 |
|                 | configure       |                 |                 |
|                 | scripts         |                 |                 |
+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+

These two examples automatically populate the variables with the correct
value for systems using converters/libiconv or the native iconv
respectively:

Example 86. Simple iconv Usage

    USES=       iconv
    LDFLAGS+=   -L${LOCALBASE}/lib ${ICONV_LIB}

Example 87. iconv Usage with configure

    USES=        iconv
    CONFIGURE_ARGS+=${ICONV_CONFIGURE_ARG}

As shown above, ICONV_LIB is empty when a native iconv is present. This
can be used to detect the native iconv and respond appropriately.

Sometimes a program has an ld argument or search path hardcoded in a
Makefile or configure script. This approach can be used to solve that
problem:

Example 88. Fixing Hardcoded -liconv

    USES=      iconv

    post-patch:
        @${REINPLACE_CMD} -e 's/-liconv/${ICONV_LIB}/' ${WRKSRC}/Makefile

In some cases it is necessary to set alternate values or perform
operations depending on whether there is a native iconv. bsd.port.pre.mk
must be included before testing the value of ICONV_LIB:

Example 89. Checking for Native iconv Availability

    USES=      iconv

    .include <bsd.port.pre.mk>

    post-patch:
    .if empty(ICONV_LIB)
        # native iconv detected
        @${REINPLACE_CMD} -e 's|iconv||' ${WRKSRC}/Config.sh
    .endif

    .include <bsd.port.post.mk>

6.23. Using Xfce

Ports that need Xfce libraries or applications set USES=xfce.

Specific Xfce library and application dependencies are set with values
assigned to USE_XFCE. They are defined in /usr/ports/Mk/Uses/xfce.mk.
The possible values are:

Values of USE_XFCE

garcon

    sysutils/garcon

libexo

    x11/libexo

libgui

    x11-toolkits/libxfce4gui

libmenu

    x11/libxfce4menu

libutil

    x11/libxfce4util

panel

    x11-wm/xfce4-panel

thunar

    x11-fm/thunar

xfconf

    x11/xfce4-conf

Example 90. USES=xfce Example

    USES=     xfce
    USE_XFCE=   libmenu

Example 91. Using Xfce’s Own GTK2 Widgets

In this example, the ported application uses the GTK2-specific widgets
x11/libxfce4menu and x11/xfce4-conf.

    USES=      xfce:gtk2
    USE_XFCE=   libmenu xfconf

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Xfce components included this way |
|                                   | will automatically include any    |
|                                   | dependencies they need. It is no  |
|                                   | longer necessary to specify the   |
|                                   | entire list. If the port only     |
|                                   | needs x11-wm/xfce4-panel, use:    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   |     USES=       xfce              |
|                                   |     USE_XFCE=   panel             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | There is no need to list the      |
|                                   | components x11-wm/xfce4-panel     |
|                                   | needs itself like this:           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   |     USES=     xfce                |
|                                   |     USE_XFC                       |
|                                   | E=   libexo libmenu libutil panel |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | However, Xfce components and      |
|                                   | non-Xfce dependencies of the port |
|                                   | must be included explicitly. Do   |
|                                   | not count on an Xfce component to |
|                                   | provide a sub-dependency other    |
|                                   | than itself for the main port.    |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

6.24. Using Budgie

Applications or libraries depending on the Budgie desktop should set
USES= budgie and set USE_BUDGIE to the list of required components.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

|                                   | The default dependency is lib-    |
|                                   | and run-time, it can be changed   |
|                                   | with :build or :run, for example: |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   |     USES=      budgie             |
|                                   |     USE_BUDGIE= screensaver:build |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Example 92. USE_BUDGIE Example

    USES=     budgie gettext gnome meson pkgconfig
    USE_BUDGIE= libbudgie

6.25. Using Databases

Example 96. Using SQLite 3

    USES=    sqlite:3

See sqlite for more information.

6.26. Starting and Stopping Services (rc Scripts)

rc.d scripts are used to start services on system startup, and to give
administrators a standard way of stopping, starting and restarting the
service. Ports integrate into the system rc.d framework. Details on its
usage can be found in the rc.d Handbook chapter. Detailed explanation of
the available commands is provided in rc(8) and rc.subr(8). Finally,
there is an article on practical aspects of rc.d scripting.

With a mythical port called doorman, which needs to start a doormand
daemon. Add the following to the Makefile:

    USE_RC_SUBR=   doormand

Multiple scripts may be listed and will be installed. Scripts must be
placed in the files subdirectory and a .in suffix must be added to their
filename. Standard SUB_LIST expansions will be ran against this file.
Use of the %%PREFIX%% and %%LOCALBASE%% expansions is strongly
encouraged as well. More on SUB_LIST in the relevant section.

As of FreeBSD 6.1-RELEASE, local rc.d scripts (including those installed
by ports) are included in the overall rcorder(8) of the base system.

An example simple rc.d script to start the doormand daemon:

    #!/bin/sh

    # PROVIDE: doormand
    # REQUIRE: LOGIN
    # KEYWORD: shutdown
    #
    # Add these lines to /etc/rc.conf.local or /etc/rc.conf
    # to enable this service:
    #
    # doormand_enable (bool):   Set to NO by default.
    #               Set it to YES to enable doormand.
    # doormand_config (path):   Set to %%PREFIX%%/etc/doormand/doormand.cf
    #               by default.

    . /etc/rc.subr

    name=doormand
    rcvar=doormand_enable

    load_rc_config $name

    : ${doormand_enable:="NO"}
    : ${doormand_config="%%PREFIX%%/etc/doormand/doormand.cf"}

    command=%%PREFIX%%/sbin/${name}
    pidfile=/var/run/${name}.pid

    command_args="-p $pidfile -f $doormand_config"

    run_rc_command "$1"

Unless there is a very good reason to start the service earlier, or it
runs as a particular user (other than root), all ports scripts must use:

    REQUIRE: LOGIN

If the startup script launches a daemon that must be shutdown, the
following will trigger a stop of the service on system shutdown:

    KEYWORD: shutdown

If the script is not starting a persistent service this is not
necessary.

For optional configuration elements the "=" style of default variable
assignment is preferable to the ":=" style here, since the former sets a
default value only if the variable is unset, and the latter sets one if
the variable is unset or null. A user might very well include something
like:

    doormand_flags=""

in their rc.conf.local, and a variable substitution using ":=" would
inappropriately override the user’s intention. The _enable variable is
not optional, and must use the ":" for the default.

6.26.1. Pre-Commit Checklist

Before contributing a port with an rc.d script, and more importantly,
before committing one, please consult this checklist to be sure that it
is ready.

The devel/rclint port can check for most of these, but it is not a
substitute for proper review.

1.  If this is a new file, does it have a .sh extension? If so, that
    must be changed to just file.in since rc.d files may not end with
    that extension.

2.  Do the name of the file (minus .in), the PROVIDE line, and $ name
    all match? The file name matching PROVIDE makes debugging easier,
    especially for rcorder(8) issues. Matching the file name and `$`name
    makes it easier to figure out which variables are relevant in
    rc.conf[.local]. It is also a policy for all new scripts, including
    those in the base system.

3.  Is the REQUIRE line set to LOGIN? This is mandatory for scripts that
    run as a non-root user. If it runs as root, is there a good reason
    for it to run prior to LOGIN? If not, it must run after so that
    local scrips can be loosely grouped to a point in rcorder(8) after
    most everything in the base is already running.

4.  Does the script start a persistent service? If so, it must have
    KEYWORD: shutdown.

5.  Make sure there is no KEYWORD: FreeBSD present. This has not been
    necessary nor desirable for years. It is also an indication that the
    new script was copy/pasted from an old script, so extra caution must
    be given to the review.

6.  If the script uses an interpreted language like perl, python, or
    ruby, make certain that command_interpreter is set appropriately,
    for example, for Perl, by adding PERL=${PERL} to SUB_LIST and using
    %%PERL%%. Otherwise,

        # service name stop

    will probably not work properly. See service(8) for more
    information.

7.  Have all occurrences of /usr/local been replaced with %%PREFIX%%?

8.  Do the default variable assignments come after load_rc_config?

9.  Are there default assignments to empty strings? They should be
    removed, but double-check that the option is documented in the
    comments at the top of the file.

10. Are things that are set in variables actually used in the script?

11. Are options listed in the default name`_flags` things that are
    actually mandatory? If so, they must be in command_args. -d is a red
    flag (pardon the pun) here, since it is usually the option to
    "daemonize" the process, and therefore is actually mandatory.

12. _name__flags must never be included in command_args (and vice versa,
    although that error is less common).

13. Does the script execute any code unconditionally? This is frowned
    on. Usually these things must be dealt with through a start_precmd.

14. All boolean tests must use the checkyesno function. No hand-rolled
    tests for [Yy][Ee][Ss], etc.

15. If there is a loop (for example, waiting for something to start)
    does it have a counter to terminate the loop? We do not want the
    boot to be stuck forever if there is an error.

16. Does the script create files or directories that need specific
    permissions, for example, a pid that needs to be owned by the user
    that runs the process? Rather than the traditional
    touch(1)/chown(8)/chmod(1) routine, consider using install(1) with
    the proper command line arguments to do the whole procedure with one
    step.

6.27. Adding Users and Groups

Some ports require a particular user account to be present, usually for
daemons that run as that user. For these ports, choose a unique UID from
50 to 999 and register it in ports/UIDs (for users) and ports/GIDs (for
groups). The unique identification should be the same for users and
groups.

Please include a patch against these two files when requiring a new user
or group to be created for the port.

Then use USERS and GROUPS in Makefile, and the user will be
automatically created when installing the port.

    USERS=   pulse
    GROUPS= pulse pulse-access pulse-rt

The current list of reserved UIDs and GIDs can be found in ports/UIDs
and ports/GIDs.

6.28. Ports That Rely on Kernel Sources

Some ports (such as kernel loadable modules) need the kernel source
files so that the port can compile. Here is the correct way to determine
if the user has them installed:

    USES=    kmod

Apart from this check, the kmod feature takes care of most items that
these ports need to take into account.

6.29. Go Libraries

Ports must not package or install Go libs or source code. Go ports must
fetch the required deps at the normal fetch time and should only install
the programs and things users need, not the things Go developers would
need.

Ports should (in order of preference):

-   Use vendored dependencies included with the package source.

-   Fetch the versions of deps specified by upstream (in the case of
    go.mod, vendor.json or similar).

-   As a last resort (deps are not included nor versions specified
    exactly) fetch versions of dependencies available at the time of
    upstream development/release.

6.30. Haskell Libraries

Just like in case of Go language, Ports must not package or install
Haskell libraries. Haskell ports must link statically to their
dependencies and fetch all distribution files on fetch stage.

6.31. Shell Completion Files

Many modern shells (including bash, fish, tcsh and zsh) support
parameter and/or option tab-completion. This support usually comes from
completion files, which contain the definitions for how tab completion
will work for a certain command. Ports sometimes ship with their own
completion files, or porters may have created them themselves.

When available, completion files should always be installed. It is not
necessary to make an option for it. If an option is used, though, always
enable it in OPTIONS_DEFAULT.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| bash                              | ${PREFIX}/etc/bash_completion.d   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| fish                              | ${PREFIX                          |
|                                   | }/share/fish/vendor_completions.d |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| zsh                               | $                                 |
|                                   | {PREFIX}/share/zsh/site-functions |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

: Table 48. Shell completion file paths

Do not register any dependencies on the shells themselves.

Chapter 7. Flavors

7.1. An Introduction to Flavors

Flavors are a way to have multiple variations of a port. The port is
built multiple times, with variations.

For example, a port can have a normal version with many features and
quite a few dependencies, and a light "lite" version with only basic
features and minimal dependencies.

Another example could be, a port can have a GTK flavor and a QT flavor,
depending on which toolkit it uses.

7.2. Using FLAVORS

To declare a port having multiple flavors, add FLAVORS to its Makefile.
The first flavor in FLAVORS is the default flavor.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | It can help simplify the logic of |
|                                   | the Makefile to also define       |
|                                   | FLAVOR as:                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   |     FLAVOR?= ${FLAVORS:[1]}       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | To distinguish flavors from       |
|                                   | options, which are always         |
|                                   | uppercase letters, flavor names   |
|                                   | can only contain lowercase        |
|                                   | letters, numbers, and the         |
|                                   | underscore _.                     |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Example 97. Basic Flavors Usage

If a port has a "lite" slave port, the slave port can be removed, and
the port can be converted to flavors with:

    FLAVORS=   default lite
    lite_PKGNAMESUFFIX= -lite
    [...]
    .if ${FLAVOR:U} != lite
    [enable non lite features]
    .endif

Example 98. Another Basic Flavors Usage

If a port has a -nox11 slave port, the slave port can be removed, and
the port can be converted to flavors with:

    FLAVORS=  x11 nox11
    FLAVOR?=    ${FLAVORS:[1]}
    nox11_PKGNAMESUFFIX=    -nox11
    [...]
    .if ${FLAVOR} == x11
    [enable x11 features]
    .endif

Example 99. More Complex Flavors Usage

Here is a slightly edited excerpt of what is present in devel/libpeas, a
port that uses the Python flavors. With the default Python 2 and 3
versions being 2.7 and 3.6, it will automatically get FLAVORS=py27 py36

    USES=        gnome python
    USE_PYTHON= flavors

    .if ${FLAVOR:Upy27:Mpy2*}
    USE_GNOME=  pygobject3

    CONFIGURE_ARGS+=    --enable-python2 --disable-python3

    BUILD_WRKSRC=   ${WRKSRC}/loaders/python
    INSTALL_WRKSRC= ${WRKSRC}/loaders/python
    .else # py3*
    USE_GNOME+= py3gobject3

    CONFIGURE_ARGS+=    --disable-python2 --enable-python3 \
                ac_cv_path_PYTHON3_CONFIG=${LOCALBASE}/bin/python${PYTHON_VER}-config

    BUILD_WRKSRC=   ${WRKSRC}/loaders/python3
    INSTALL_WRKSRC= ${WRKSRC}/loaders/python3
    .endif

    py34_PLIST= ${.CURDIR}/pkg-plist-py3
    py35_PLIST= ${.CURDIR}/pkg-plist-py3
    py36_PLIST= ${.CURDIR}/pkg-plist-py3

This port does not use USE_PYTHON=distutils but needs Python flavors
anyway. To guard against FLAVOR being empty, which would cause a make(1)
error, use ${FLAVOR:U} in string comparisons instead of ${FLAVOR}. The
Gnome Python gobject3 bindings have two different names, one for Python
2, pygobject3 and one for Python 3, py3gobject3. The configure script
has to run in ${WRKSRC}, but we are only interested in building and
installing the Python 2 or Python 3 parts of the software, so set the
build and install base directories appropriately. Hint about the correct
Python 3 config script path name. The packing list is different when the
built with Python 3. As there are three possible Python 3 versions, set
PLIST for all three using the helper.

7.2.1. Flavors Helpers

To make the Makefile easier to write, a few flavors helpers exist.

This list of helpers will set their variable:

-   flavor_PKGNAMEPREFIX

-   flavor_PKGNAMESUFFIX

-   flavor_PLIST

-   flavor_DESCR

This list of helpers will append to their variable:

-   flavor_CONFLICTS

-   flavor_CONFLICTS_BUILD

-   flavor_CONFLICTS_INSTALL

-   flavor_PKG_DEPENDS

-   flavor_EXTRACT_DEPENDS

-   flavor_PATCH_DEPENDS

-   flavor_FETCH_DEPENDS

-   flavor_BUILD_DEPENDS

-   flavor_LIB_DEPENDS

-   flavor_RUN_DEPENDS

-   flavor_TEST_DEPENDS

Example 100. Flavor Specific PKGNAME

As all packages must have a different package name, flavors must change
theirs, using flavor_PKGNAMEPREFIX and flavor_PKGNAMESUFFIX makes this
easy:

    FLAVORS= normal lite
    lite_PKGNAMESUFFIX= -lite

7.3. USES=php and Flavors

When using php with one of these arguments, phpize, ext, zend, or pecl,
the port will automatically have FLAVORS filled in with the PHP versions
it supports.

Example 101. Simple USES=php Extension

This will generate package for all the supported versions:

    PORTNAME= some-ext
    PORTVERSION=    0.0.1
    PKGNAMEPREFIX=  ${PHP_PKGNAMEPREFIX}

    USES=       php:ext

This will generate package for all the supported versions but 7.2:

    PORTNAME= some-ext
    PORTVERSION=    0.0.1
    PKGNAMEPREFIX=  ${PHP_PKGNAMEPREFIX}

    USES=       php:ext
    IGNORE_WITH_PHP=    72

7.3.1. PHP Flavors with PHP Applications

PHP applications can also be flavorized.

This allows generating packages for all PHP versions, so that users can
use them with whatever version they need on their servers.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | PHP applications that are         |
|                                   | flavorized must append            |
|                                   | PHP_PKGNAMESUFFIX to their        |
|                                   | package names.                    |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Example 102. Flavorizing a PHP Application

Adding Flavors support to a PHP application is straightforward:

    PKGNAMESUFFIX=   ${PHP_PKGNAMESUFFIX}

    USES=   php:flavors

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | When adding a dependency on a PHP |
|                                   | flavored port, use                |
|                                   | @${PHP_FLAVOR}. Never use FLAVOR  |
|                                   | directly.                         |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

7.4. USES=python and Flavors

When using python and USE_PYTHON=distutils, the port will automatically
have FLAVORS filled in with the Python versions it supports.

Example 103. Simple USES=python

Supposing the current Python supported versions are 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, and
3.6, and the default Python 2 and 3 versions are 2.7 and 3.6, a port
with:

    USES=   python
    USE_PYTHON= distutils

Will get these flavors: py27, and py36.

    USES=    python
    USE_PYTHON= distutils allflavors

Will get these flavors: py27, py34, py35 and py36.

Example 104. USES=python with Version Requirements

Supposing the current Python supported versions are 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, and
3.6, and the default Python 2 and 3 versions are 2.7 and 3.6, a port
with:

    USES= python:-3.5
    USE_PYTHON= distutils

Will get this flavor: py27.

    USES= python:-3.5
    USE_PYTHON= distutils allflavors

Will get these flavors: py27, py34, and py35.

    USES=  python:3.4+
    USE_PYTHON= distutils

Will get this flavor: py36.

    USES= python:3.4+
    USE_PYTHON= distutils allflavors

Will get these flavors: py34, py35, and py36.

PY_FLAVOR is available to depend on the correct version of Python
modules. All dependencies on flavored Python ports should use PY_FLAVOR,
and not FLAVOR directly..

Example 105. For a Port Not Using distutils

If the default Python 3 version is 3.6, the following will set PY_FLAVOR
to py36:

    RUN_DEPENDS=    ${PYTHON_PKGNAMEPREFIX}mutagen>0:audio/py-mutagen@${PY_FLAVOR}

    USES=   python:3.5+

7.5. USES=lua and Flavors

When using lua:module or lua:flavors, the port will automatically have
FLAVORS filled in with the Lua versions it supports. However, it is not
expected that ordinary applications (rather than Lua modules) should use
this feature; most applications that embed or otherwise use Lua should
simply use USES=lua.

LUA_FLAVOR is available (and must be used) to depend on the correct
version of dependencies regardless of whether the port used the flavors
or module parameters.

See Using Lua for further information.

Chapter 8. Advanced pkg-plist Practices

8.1. Changing pkg-plist Based on Make Variables

Some ports, particularly the p5- ports, need to change their pkg-plist
depending on what options they are configured with (or version of perl,
in the case of p5- ports). To make this easy, any instances in pkg-plist
of %%OSREL%%, %%PERL_VER%%, and %%PERL_VERSION%% will be substituted
appropriately. The value of %%OSREL%% is the numeric revision of the
operating system (for example, 4.9). %%PERL_VERSION%% and %%PERL_VER%%
is the full version number of perl (for example, 5.8.9). Several other
%%VARS%% related to port’s documentation files are described in the
relevant section.

To make other substitutions, set PLIST_SUB with a list of VAR=VALUE
pairs and instances of %%VAR%% will be substituted with VALUE in
pkg-plist.

For instance, if a port installs many files in a version-specific
subdirectory, use a placeholder for the version so that pkg-plist does
not have to be regenerated every time the port is updated. For example,
set:

    OCTAVE_VERSION= ${PORTREVISION}
    PLIST_SUB=  OCTAVE_VERSION=${OCTAVE_VERSION}

in the Makefile and use %%OCTAVE_VERSION%% wherever the version shows up
in pkg-plist. When the port is upgraded, it will not be necessary to
edit dozens (or in some cases, hundreds) of lines in pkg-plist.

If files are installed conditionally on the options set in the port, the
usual way of handling it is prefixing pkg-plist lines with a %%OPT%% for
lines needed when the option is enabled, or %%NO_OPT%% when the option
is disabled, and adding OPTIONS_SUB=yes to the Makefile. See OPTIONS_SUB
for more information.

For instance, if there are files that are only installed when the X11
option is enabled, and Makefile has:

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=    X11
    OPTIONS_SUB=    yes

In pkg-plist, put %%X11%% in front of the lines only being installed
when the option is enabled, like this :

    %%X11%%bin/foo-gui

This substitution will be done between the pre-install and do-install
targets, by reading from PLIST and writing to TMPPLIST (default:
WRKDIR/.PLIST.mktmp). So if the port builds PLIST on the fly, do so in
or before pre-install. Also, if the port needs to edit the resulting
file, do so in post-install to a file named TMPPLIST.

Another way of modifying a port’s packing list is based on setting the
variables PLIST_FILES and PLIST_DIRS. The value of each variable is
regarded as a list of pathnames to write to TMPPLIST along with PLIST
contents. While names listed in PLIST_FILES and PLIST_DIRS are subject
to %%VAR%% substitution as described above, it is better to use the
${VAR} directly. Except for that, names from PLIST_FILES will appear in
the final packing list unchanged, while @dir will be prepended to names
from PLIST_DIRS. To take effect, PLIST_FILES and PLIST_DIRS must be set
before TMPPLIST is written, that is, in pre-install or earlier.

From time to time, using OPTIONS_SUB is not enough. In those cases,
adding a specific TAG to PLIST_SUB inside the Makefile with a special
value of @comment, makes package tools to ignore the line. For instance,
if some files are only installed when the X11 option is on and the
architecture is i386:

    .include <bsd.port.pre.mk>

    .if ${PORT_OPTIONS:MX11} && ${ARCH} == "i386"
    PLIST_SUB+= X11I386=""
    .else
    PLIST_SUB+= X11I386="@comment "
    .endif

8.2. Empty Directories

8.2.1. Cleaning Up Empty Directories

When being de-installed, a port has to remove empty directories it
created. Most of these directories are removed automatically by pkg(8),
but for directories created outside of ${PREFIX}, or empty directories,
some more work needs to be done. This is usually accomplished by adding
@dir lines for those directories. Subdirectories must be deleted before
deleting parent directories.

    [...]
    @dir /var/games/oneko/saved-games
    @dir /var/games/oneko

8.2.2. Creating Empty Directories

Empty directories created during port installation need special
attention. They must be present when the package is created. If they are
not created by the port code, create them in the Makefile:

    post-install:
        ${MKDIR} ${STAGEDIR}${PREFIX}/some/directory

Add the directory to pkg-plist like any other. For example:

    @dir some/directory

8.3. Configuration Files

If the port installs configuration files to PREFIX/etc (or elsewhere) do
not list them in pkg-plist. That will cause pkg delete to remove files
that have been carefully edited by the user, and a re-installation will
wipe them out.

Instead, install sample files with a filename.sample extension. The
@sample macro automates this, see @sample file [file] for what it does
exactly. For each sample file, add a line to pkg-plist:

    @sample etc/orbit.conf.sample

If there is a very good reason not to install a working configuration
file by default, only list the sample filename in pkg-plist, without the
@sample followed by a space part, and add a message pointing out that
the user must copy and edit the file before the software will work.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | When a port installs its          |

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

8.4. Dynamic Versus Static Package List

A static package list is a package list which is available in the Ports
Collection either as pkg-plist (with or without variable substitution),
or embedded into the Makefile via PLIST_FILES and PLIST_DIRS. Even if
the contents are auto-generated by a tool or a target in the Makefile
before the inclusion into the Ports Collection by a committer (for
example, using make makeplist), this is still considered a static list,
since it is possible to examine it without having to download or compile
the distfile.

A dynamic package list is a package list which is generated at the time
the port is compiled based upon the files and directories which are
installed. It is not possible to examine it before the source code of
the ported application is downloaded and compiled, or after running a
make clean.

While the use of dynamic package lists is not forbidden, maintainers
should use static package lists wherever possible, as it enables users
to grep(1) through available ports to discover, for example, which port
installs a certain file. Dynamic lists should be primarily used for
complex ports where the package list changes drastically based upon
optional features of the port (and thus maintaining a static package
list is infeasible), or ports which change the package list based upon
the version of dependent software used. For example, ports which
generate docs with Javadoc.

8.5. Automated Package List Creation

First, make sure the port is almost complete, with only pkg-plist
missing. Running make makeplist will show an example for pkg-plist. The
output of makeplist must be double checked for correctness as it tries
to automatically guess a few things, and can get it wrong.

User configuration files should be installed as filename.sample, as it
is described in Configuration Files. info/dir must not be listed and
appropriate install-info lines must be added as noted in the info files
section. Any libraries installed by the port must be listed as specified
in the shared libraries section.

8.5.1. Expanding PLIST_SUB with Regular Expressions

Strings to be replaced sometimes need to be very specific to avoid
undesired replacements. This is a common problem with shorter values.

To address this problem, for each PLACEHOLDER=value, a
PLACEHOLDER_regex=regex can be set, with the regex part matching value
more precisely.

Example 106. Using PLIST_SUB with Regular Expressions

Perl ports can install architecture dependent files in a specific tree.
On FreeBSD to ease porting, this tree is called mach. For example, a
port that installs a file whose path contains mach could have that part
of the path string replaced with the wrong values. Consider this
Makefile:

    PORTNAME= Machine-Build
    DISTVERSION=    1
    CATEGORIES= devel perl5
    MASTER_SITES=   CPAN
    PKGNAMEPREFIX=  p5-

    MAINTAINER= perl@FreeBSD.org
    COMMENT=    Building machine
    WWW=        https://search.cpan.org/dist/Machine-Build

    USES=       perl5
    USE_PERL5=  configure

    PLIST_SUB=  PERL_ARCH=mach

The files installed by the port are:

    /usr/local/bin/machine-build
    /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/man/man1/machine-build.1.gz
    /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/man/man3/Machine::Build.3.gz
    /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/Machine/Build.pm
    /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/mach/5.20/Machine/Build/Build.so

Running make makeplist wrongly generates:

    bin/%%PERL_ARCH%%ine-build
    %%PERL5_MAN1%%/%%PERL_ARCH%%ine-build.1.gz
    %%PERL5_MAN3%%/Machine::Build.3.gz
    %%SITE_PERL%%/Machine/Build.pm
    %%SITE_PERL%%/%%PERL_ARCH%%/%%PERL_VER%%/Machine/Build/Build.so

Change the PLIST_SUB line from the Makefile to:

    PLIST_SUB=  PERL_ARCH=mach \
            PERL_ARCH_regex=\bmach\b

Now make makeplist correctly generates:

    bin/machine-build
    %%PERL5_MAN1%%/machine-build.1.gz
    %%PERL5_MAN3%%/Machine::Build.3.gz
    %%SITE_PERL%%/Machine/Build.pm
    %%SITE_PERL%%/%%PERL_ARCH%%/%%PERL_VER%%/Machine/Build/Build.so

8.6. Expanding Package List with Keywords

All keywords can also take optional arguments in parentheses. The
arguments are owner, group, and mode. This argument is used on the file
or directory referenced. To change the owner, group, and mode of a
configuration file, use:

    @sample(games,games,640) etc/config.sample

The arguments are optional. If only the group and mode need to be
changed, use:

    @sample(,games,660) etc/config.sample

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

8.6.1. @desktop-file-utils

Will run update-desktop-database -q after installation and
deinstallation. Never use directly, add USES=desktop-file-utils to the
Makefile.

8.6.2. @fc directory

Add a @dir entry for the directory passed as an argument, and run
fc-cache -fs on that directory after installation and deinstallation.

8.6.3. @fontsdir directory

Add a @dir entry for the directory passed as an argument, and run
mkfontscale and mkfontdir on that directory after installation and
deinstallation. Additionally, on deinstallation, it removes the
fonts.scale and fonts.dir cache files if they are empty.

8.6.4. @info file

Add the file passed as argument to the plist, and updates the info
document index on installation and deinstallation. Additionally, it
removes the index if empty on deinstallation. This should never be used
manually, but always through INFO. See Info Files for more information.

8.6.5. @kld directory

Runs kldxref on the directory on installation and deinstallation.
Additionally, on deinstallation, it will remove the directory if empty.

8.6.6. @rmtry file

Will remove the file on deinstallation, and not give an error if the
file is not there.

8.6.7. @sample file [file]

This is used to handle installation of configuration files, through
example files bundled with the package. The "actual", non-sample, file
is either the second filename, if present, or the first filename without
the .sample extension.

This does three things. First, add the first file passed as argument,
the sample file, to the plist. Then, on installation, if the actual file
is not found, copy the sample file to the actual file. And finally, on
deinstallation, remove the actual file if it has not been modified. See
Configuration Files for more information.

8.6.8. @shared-mime-info directory

Runs update-mime-database on the directory on installation and
deinstallation.

8.6.9. @shell file

Add the file passed as argument to the plist.

On installation, add the full path to file to /etc/shells, while making
sure it is not added twice. On deinstallation, remove it from
/etc/shells.

8.6.10. @terminfo

Do not use by itself. If the port installs *.terminfo files, add to its
Makefile.

On installation and deinstallation, if tic is present, refresh
${PREFIX}/shared/misc/terminfo.db from the *.terminfo files in
${PREFIX}/shared/misc.

8.6.11. Base Keywords

There are a few keywords that are hardcoded, and documented in
pkg-create(8). For the sake of completeness, they are also documented
here.

8.6.11.1. @ [file]

The empty keyword is a placeholder to use when the file’s owner, group,
or mode need to be changed. For example, to set the group of the file to
games and add the setgid bit, add:

    @(,games,2755) sbin/daemon

8.6.11.2. @preexec command, @postexec command, @preunexec command, @postunexec command

Execute command as part of the package installation or deinstallation
process.

@preexec command

    Execute command as part of the pre-install scripts.

@postexec command

    Execute command as part of the post-install scripts.

@preunexec command

    Execute command as part of the pre-deinstall scripts.

@postunexec command

    Execute command as part of the post-deinstall scripts.

If command contains any of these sequences somewhere in it, they are
expanded inline. For these examples, assume that @cwd is set to
/usr/local and the last extracted file was bin/emacs.

%F

    Expand to the last filename extracted (as specified). In the example
    case bin/emacs.

%D

    Expand to the current directory prefix, as set with @cwd. In the
    example case /usr/local.

%B

    Expand to the basename of the fully qualified filename, that is, the
    current directory prefix plus the last filespec, minus the trailing
    filename. In the example case, that would be /usr/local/bin.

%f

    Expand to the filename part of the fully qualified name, or the
    converse of %B. In the example case, emacs.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | These keywords are here to help   |
|                                   | you set up the package so that it |
|                                   | is as ready to use as possible.   |
|                                   | They must not be abused to start  |
|                                   | services, stop services, or run   |
|                                   | any other commands that will      |
|                                   | modify the currently running      |

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

8.6.11.3. @mode mode

Set default permission for all subsequently extracted files to mode.
Format is the same as that used by chmod(1). Use without an arg to set
back to default permissions (mode of the file while being packed).

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | This must be a numeric mode, like |
|                                   | 644, 4755, or 600. It cannot be a |
|                                   | relative mode like u+s.           |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

8.6.11.4. @owner user

Set default ownership for all subsequent files to user. Use without an
argument to set back to default ownership (root).

8.6.11.5. @group group

Set default group ownership for all subsequent files to group. Use
without an arg to set back to default group ownership (wheel).

8.6.11.6. @comment string

This line is ignored when packing.

8.6.11.7. @dir directory

Declare directory name. By default, directories created under PREFIX by
a package installation are automatically removed. Use this when an empty
directory under PREFIX needs to be created, or when the directory needs
to have non default owner, group, or mode. Directories outside of PREFIX
need to be registered. For example, /var/db/${PORTNAME} needs to have a
@dir entry whereas ${PREFIX}/shared/${PORTNAME} does not if it contains
files or uses the default owner, group, and mode.

8.6.11.8. @exec command, @unexec command (Deprecated)

Execute command as part of the installation or deinstallation process.
Please use @preexec command, @postexec command, @preunexec command,
@postunexec command instead.

8.6.11.9. @dirrm directory (Deprecated)

Declare directory name to be deleted at deinstall time. By default,
directories created under PREFIX by a package installation are deleted
when the package is deinstalled.

8.6.11.10. @dirrmtry directory (Deprecated)

Declare directory name to be removed, as for @dirrm, but does not issue
a warning if the directory cannot be removed.

8.6.12. Creating New Keywords

Package list files can be extended by keywords that are defined in the
${PORTSDIR}/Keywords directory. The settings for each keyword are stored
in a UCL file named keyword.ucl. The file must contain at least one of
these sections:

-   attributes

-   action

-   pre-install

-   post-install

-   pre-deinstall

-   post-deinstall

-   pre-upgrade

-   post-upgrade

8.6.12.1. attributes

Changes the owner, group, or mode used by the keyword. Contains an
associative array where the possible keys are owner, group, and mode.
The values are, respectively, a user name, a group name, and a file
mode. For example:

    attributes: { owner: "games", group: "games", mode: 0555 }

8.6.12.2. action

Defines what happens to the keyword’s parameter. Contains an array where
the possible values are:

setprefix

    Set the prefix for the next plist entries.

dir

    Register a directory to be created on install and removed on
    deinstall.

dirrm

    Register a directory to be deleted on deinstall. Deprecated.

dirrmtry

    Register a directory to try and deleted on deinstall. Deprecated.

file

    Register a file.

setmode

    Set the mode for the next plist entries.

setowner

    Set the owner for the next plist entries.

setgroup

    Set the group for the next plist entries.

comment

    Does not do anything, equivalent to not entering an action section.

ignore_next

    Ignore the next entry in the plist.

8.6.12.3. arguments

If set to true, adds argument handling, splitting the whole line, %@,
into numbered arguments, %1, %2, and so on. For example, for this line:

    @foo some.content other.content

%1 and %2 will contain:

    some.content
    other.content

It also affects how the action entry works. When there is more than one
argument, the argument number must be specified. For example:

    actions: [file(1)]

8.6.12.4. pre-install, post-install, pre-deinstall, post-deinstall, pre-upgrade, post-upgrade

These keywords contains a sh(1) script to be executed before or after
installation, deinstallation, or upgrade of the package. In addition to
the usual @exec %foo placeholders described in @preexec command,
@postexec command, @preunexec command, @postunexec command, there is a
new one, %@, which represents the argument of the keyword.

8.6.12.5. Custom Keyword Examples

Example 107. Example of a @dirrmtryecho Keyword

This keyword does two things, it adds a @dirrmtry directory line to the
packing list, and echoes the fact that the directory is removed when
deinstalling the package.

    actions: [dirrmtry]
    post-deinstall: <<EOD
      echo "Directory %D/%@ removed."
    EOD

Example 108. Real Life Example, How @sample is Implemented

This keyword does three things. It adds the first filename passed as an
argument to @sample to the packing list, it adds to the post-install
script instructions to copy the sample to the actual configuration file
if it does not already exist, and it adds to the post-deinstall
instructions to remove the configuration file if it has not been
modified.

    actions: [file(1)]
    arguments: true
    post-install: <<EOD
      case "%1" in
      /*) sample_file="%1" ;;
      *) sample_file="%D/%1" ;;
      esac
      target_file="${sample_file%.sample}"
      set -- %@
      if [ $# -eq 2 ]; then
          target_file=${2}
      fi
      case "${target_file}" in
      /*) target_file="${target_file}" ;;
      *) target_file="%D/${target_file}" ;;
      esac
      if ! [ -f "${target_file}" ]; then
        /bin/cp -p "${sample_file}" "${target_file}" && \
          /bin/chmod u+w "${target_file}"
      fi
    EOD
    pre-deinstall: <<EOD
      case "%1" in
      /*) sample_file="%1" ;;
      *) sample_file="%D/%1" ;;
      esac
      target_file="${sample_file%.sample}"
      set -- %@
      if [ $# -eq 2 ]; then
          set -- %@
          target_file=${2}
      fi
      case "${target_file}" in
      /*) target_file="${target_file}" ;;
      *) target_file="%D/${target_file}" ;;
      esac
      if cmp -s "${target_file}" "${sample_file}"; then
        rm -f "${target_file}"
      else
        echo "You may need to manually remove ${target_file} if it is no longer needed."
      fi
    EOD

Chapter 9. pkg-*

There are some tricks we have not mentioned yet about the pkg-* files
that come in handy sometimes.

9.1. pkg-message

To display a message when the package is installed, place the message in
pkg-message. This capability is often useful to display additional
installation steps to be taken after a pkg install or pkg upgrade.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

pkg-message supports two formats:

raw

    A regular plain text file. Its message is only displayed on install.

UCL

    If the file starts with “[” then it is considered to be a UCL file.
    The UCL format is described on libucl’s GitHub page.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Do not add an entry for           |
|                                   | pkg-message in pkg-plist.         |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

9.1.1. UCL in pkg-message

The format is the following. It should be an array of objects. The
objects themselves can have these keywords:

message

    The actual message to be displayed. This keyword is mandatory.

type

    When the message should be displayed.

maximum_version

    Only if type is upgrade. Display if upgrading from a version
    strictly lower than the version specified.

minimum_version

    Only if type is upgrade. Display if upgrading from a version
    strictly greater than the version specified.

The maximum_version and minimum_version keywords can be combined.

The type keyword can have three values:

install

    The message should only be displayed when the package is installed.

remove

    The message should only be displayed when the package is removed.

upgrade

    the message should only be displayed during an upgrade of the
    package..

Example 109. UCL Short Strings

The message is delimited by double quotes ", this is used for simple
single line strings:

    [
    { type: install
      message: "Simple message"
    }
    ]

Example 110. UCL Multiline Strings

Multiline strings use the standard here document notation. The multiline
delimiter must start just after << symbols without any whitespace and it
must consist of capital letters only. To finish a multiline string, add
the delimiter string on a line of its own without any whitespace. The
message from UCL Short Strings can be written as:

    [
    { type: install
      message: <<EOM
    Simple message
    EOM
    }
    ]

Example 111. Display a Message on Install/Deinstall

When a message only needs to be displayed on installation or
uninstallation, set the type:

    [
    {
      type: remove
      message: "package being removed."
    }
    { type: install, message: "package being installed."}
    ]

Example 112. Display a Message on Upgrade

When a port is upgraded, the message displayed can be even more tailored
to the port’s needs.

    [
    {
      type: upgrade
      message: "Package is being upgraded."
    }
    {
      type: upgrade
      maximum_version: "1.0"
      message: "Upgrading from before 1.0 need to do this."
    }
    {
      type: upgrade
      minimum_version: "1.0"
      message: "Upgrading from after 1.0 should do that."
    }
    {
      type: upgrade
      maximum_version: "3.0"
      minimum_version: "1.0"
      message: "Upgrading from > 1.0 and < 3.0 remove that file."
    }
    ]

When displaying a message on upgrade, it is important to limit when it
is being shown to the user. Most of the time it is by using
maximum_version to limit its usage to upgrades from before a certain
version when something specific needs to be done.

9.2. pkg-install, pkg-pre-install, and pkg-post-install

If the port needs to execute commands when the binary package is
installed with pkg add or pkg install, use pkg-install. It is run twice
by pkg, the first time as ${SH} pkg-install ${PKGNAME} PRE-INSTALL
before the package is installed, and the second time as
${SH} pkg-install ${PKGNAME} POST-INSTALL after it has been installed.
$2 can be tested to determine which mode the script is being run in. The
PKG_PREFIX environment variable is set to the package installation
directory.

If using pkg-pre-install or pkg-post-install instead, the script is run
only once (before or after installing the package), with the single
argument ${PKGNAME}. Using pkg-pre-install.lua or pkg-post-install.lua
will run a lua script instead of a shell script. Lua scripts run by pkg
provide some extensions and a few restrictions, both explained in
pkg-lua-script(5).

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Using pkg-pre-install (or         |
|                                   | pkg-pre-install.lua) and          |
|                                   | pkg-post-install (or              |
|                                   | pkg-post-install.lua) is          |
|                                   | preferred to using pkg-install.   |

|                                   | be abused to start services, stop |

|                                   | commands that will modify the     |
|                                   | currently running system.         |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

9.3. pkg-deinstall, pkg-pre-deinstall, and pkg-post-deinstall

These scripts execute when a package is removed.

The pkg-deinstall script is run twice by pkg delete. The first time as
${SH} pkg-deinstall ${PKGNAME} DEINSTALL before the port is de-installed
and the second time as ${SH} pkg-deinstall ${PKGNAME} POST-DEINSTALL
after the port has been de-installed. $2 can be tested to determine
which mode the script is being run in. The PKG_PREFIX environment
variable is set to the package installation directory.

If using pkg-pre-deinstall or pkg-post-deinstall instead, the script is
run only once (before or after deinstalling the package), with the
single argument ${PKGNAME}. Using pkg-pre-deinstall.lua or
pkg-post-deinstall.lua will run a lua script instead of a shell script.
Lua scripts run by pkg provide some extensions and a few restrictions,
both explained in pkg-lua-script(5).

|                                   | pkg-post-deinstall (or            |
|                                   | pkg-post-deinstall.lua) is        |
|                                   | preferred to using pkg-deinstall. |

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

9.4. Changing the Names of pkg-*

All the names of pkg-* are defined using variables that can be changed
in the Makefile if needed. This is especially useful when sharing the
same pkg-* files among several ports or when it is necessary to write to
one of these files. See writing to places other than WRKDIR for why it
is a bad idea to write directly into the directory containing the pkg-*
files.

Here is a list of variable names and their default values. (PKGDIR
defaults to ${MASTERDIR}.)

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Variable                          | Default value                     |
+===================================+===================================+
| DESCR                             | ${PKGDIR}/pkg-descr               |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| PLIST                             | ${PKGDIR}/pkg-plist               |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| PKGINSTALL                        | ${PKGDIR}/pkg-install             |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| PKGPREINSTALL                     | ${PKGDIR}/pkg-pre-install         |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| PKGPOSTINSTALL                    | ${PKGDIR}/pkg-post-install        |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| PKGDEINSTALL                      | ${PKGDIR}/pkg-deinstall           |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| PKGPREDEINSTALL                   | ${PKGDIR}/pkg-pre-deinstall       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| PKGPOSTDEINSTALL                  | ${PKGDIR}/pkg-post-deinstall      |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| PKGMESSAGE                        | ${PKGDIR}/pkg-message             |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

9.5. Making Use of SUB_FILES and SUB_LIST

SUB_FILES and SUB_LIST are useful for dynamic values in port files, such
as the installation PREFIX in pkg-message.

SUB_FILES specifies a list of files to be automatically modified. Each
file in the SUB_FILES list must have a corresponding file.in present in
FILESDIR. A modified version will be created as ${WRKDIR}/file. Files
defined as a value of USE_RC_SUBR are automatically added to SUB_FILES.
For the files pkg-message, pkg-install, and pkg-deinstall, the
corresponding Makefile variable is automatically set to point to the
processed version.

SUB_LIST is a list of VAR=VALUE pairs. For each pair, %%VAR%% will be
replaced with VALUE in each file listed in SUB_FILES. Several common
pairs are automatically defined: PREFIX, LOCALBASE, DATADIR, DOCSDIR,
EXAMPLESDIR, WWWDIR, and ETCDIR. Any line beginning with @comment
followed by a space, will be deleted from resulting files after a
variable substitution.

This example replaces %%ARCH%% with the system architecture in a
pkg-message:

    SUB_FILES= pkg-message
    SUB_LIST=   ARCH=${ARCH}

Note that for this example, pkg-message.in must exist in FILESDIR.

Example of a good pkg-message.in:

    Now it is time to configure this package.
    Copy %%PREFIX%%/shared/examples/putsy/%%ARCH%%.conf into your home directory
    as .putsy.conf and edit it.

Chapter 10. Testing the Port

10.1. Running make describe

Several of the FreeBSD port maintenance tools, such as portupgrade(1),
rely on a database called /usr/ports/INDEX which keeps track of such
items as port dependencies. INDEX is created by the top-level
ports/Makefile via make index, which descends into each port
subdirectory and executes make describe there. Thus, if make describe
fails in any port, no one can generate INDEX, and many people will
quickly become unhappy.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | It is important to be able to     |
|                                   | generate this file no matter what |
|                                   | options are present in make.conf, |
|                                   | so please avoid doing things such |
|                                   | as using .error statements when   |
|                                   | (for instance) a dependency is    |
|                                   | not satisfied. (See Avoid Use of  |
|                                   | the .error Construct.)            |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

If make describe produces a string rather than an error message,
everything is probably safe. See bsd.port.mk for the meaning of the
string produced.

Also note that running a recent version of portlint (as specified in the
next section) will cause make describe to be run automatically.

10.2. Portclippy / Portfmt

Those tools come from ports-mgmt/portfmt.

Portclippy is a linter that checks if variables in the Makefile are in
the correct order according to Order of Variables in Port Makefiles.

Portfmt is a tool for automatically formatting Makefile.

10.3. Portlint

Do check the port with portlint before submitting or committing it.
portlint warns about many common errors, both functional and stylistic.
For a new port, portlint -A is the most thorough; for an existing port,
portlint -C is sufficient.

Since portlint uses heuristics to try to figure out errors, it can
produce false positive warnings. In addition, occasionally something
that is flagged as a problem really cannot be done in any other way due
to limitations in the ports framework. When in doubt, the best thing to
do is ask on FreeBSD ports mailing list.

10.4. Port Tools

The ports-mgmt/porttools program is part of the Ports Collection.

port is the front-end script, which can help simplify the testing job.
Whenever a new port or an update to an existing one needs testing, use
port test to test the port, including the portlint checking. This
command also detects and lists any files that are not listed in
pkg-plist. For example:

    # port test /usr/ports/net/csup

10.5. PREFIX and DESTDIR

PREFIX determines where the port will be installed. It defaults to
/usr/local, but can be set by the user to a custom path like /opt. The
port must respect the value of this variable.

DESTDIR, if set by the user, determines the complete alternative
environment, usually a jail or an installed system mounted somewhere
other than /. A port will actually install into DESTDIR/PREFIX, and
register with the package database in DESTDIR/var/db/pkg. DESTDIR is
handled automatically by the ports infrastructure with chroot(8). There
is no need for modifications or any extra care to write
DESTDIR-compliant ports.

The value of PREFIX will be set to LOCALBASE (defaulting to /usr/local).
If USE_LINUX_PREFIX is set, PREFIX will be LINUXBASE (defaulting to
/compat/linux).

Avoiding hard-coded /usr/local paths in the source makes the port much
more flexible and able to cater to the needs of other sites. Often, this
can be accomplished by replacing occurrences of /usr/local in the port’s
various Makefiles with ${PREFIX}. This variable is automatically passed
down to every stage of the build and install processes.

Make sure the application is not installing things in /usr/local instead
of PREFIX. A quick test for such hard-coded paths is:

    % make clean; make package PREFIX=/var/tmp/`make -V PORTNAME`

If anything is installed outside of PREFIX, the package creation process
will complain that it cannot find the files.

In addition, it is worth checking the same with the stage directory
support (see Staging):

    % make stage && make check-plist && make stage-qa && make package

-   check-plist checks for files missing from the plist, and files in
    the plist that are not installed by the port.

-   stage-qa checks for common problems like bad shebang, symlinks
    pointing outside the stage directory, setuid files, and non-stripped
    libraries…​

These tests will not find hard-coded paths inside the port’s files, nor
will it verify that LOCALBASE is being used to correctly refer to files
from other ports. The temporarily installed port in
/var/tmp/make -V PORTNAME must be tested for proper operation to make
sure there are no problems with paths.

PREFIX must not be set explicitly in a port’s Makefile. Users installing
the port may have set PREFIX to a custom location, and the port must
respect that setting.

Refer to programs and files from other ports with the variables
mentioned above, not explicit pathnames. For instance, if the port
requires a macro PAGER to have the full pathname of less, do not use a
literal path of /usr/local/bin/less. Instead, use ${LOCALBASE}:

    -DPAGER=\"${LOCALBASE}/bin/less\"

The path with LOCALBASE is more likely to still work if the system
administrator has moved the whole /usr/local tree somewhere else.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

10.6. poudriere

For a ports contributor, poudriere is one of the most important and
helpful testing and build tools. Its main features include:

-   Bulk building of the entire ports tree, specific subsets of the
    ports tree, or a single port including its dependencies

-   Automatic packaging of build results

-   Generation of build log files per port

-   Providing a signed pkg(8) repository

-   Testing of port builds before submitting a patch to the FreeBSD bug
    tracker or committing to the ports tree

-   Testing for successful ports builds using different options

Because poudriere performs its building in a clean jail(8) environment
and uses zfs(8) features, it has several advantages over traditional
testing on the host system:

-   No pollution of the host environment: No leftover files, no
    accidental removals, no changes of existing configuration files.

-   Verify pkg-plist for missing or superfluous entries

-   Ports committers sometimes ask for a poudriere log alongside a patch
    submission to assess whether the patch is ready for integration into
    the ports tree

It is also quite straightforward to set up and use, has no dependencies,
and will run on any supported FreeBSD release. This section shows how to
install, configure, and run poudriere as part of the normal workflow of
a ports contributor.

The examples in this section show a default file layout, as standard in
FreeBSD. Substitute any local changes accordingly. The ports tree,
represented by ${PORTSDIR}, is located in /usr/ports. Both ${LOCALBASE}
and ${PREFIX} are /usr/local by default.

10.6.1. Installing poudriere

poudriere is available in the ports tree in ports-mgmt/poudriere. It can
be installed using pkg(8) or from ports:

    # pkg install poudriere

or

    # make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/poudriere install clean

There is also a work-in-progress version of poudriere which will
eventually become the next release. It is available in
ports-mgmt/poudriere-devel. This development version is used for the
official FreeBSD package builds, so it is well tested. It often has
newer interesting features. A ports committer will want to use the
development version because it is what is used in production, and has
all the new features that will make sure everything is exactly right. A
contributor will not necessarily need those as the most important fixes
are backported to released version. The main reason for the use of the
development version to build the official package is because it is
faster, in a way that will shorten a full build from 18 hours to 17
hours when using a high end 32 CPU server with 128GB of RAM. Those
optimizations will not matter a lot when building ports on a desktop
machine.

10.6.2. Setting Up poudriere

The port installs a default configuration file,
/usr/local/etc/poudriere.conf. Each parameter is documented in the
configuration file and in poudriere(8). Here is a minimal example config
file:

    ZPOOL=tank
    BASEFS=/poudriere
    DISTFILES_CACHE=/usr/ports/distfiles
    RESOLV_CONF=/etc/resolv.conf

ZPOOL

    The name of the ZFS storage pool which poudriere shall use. Must be
    listed in the output of zpool status.

BASEFS

    The root mount point for poudriere file systems. This entry will
    cause poudriere to mount tank/poudriere to /poudriere.

DISTFILES_CACHE

    Defines where distfiles are stored. In this example, poudriere and
    the host share the distfiles storage directory. This avoids
    downloading tarballs which are already present on the system. Please
    create this directory if it does not already exist so that poudriere
    can find it.

RESOLV_CONF

    Use the host /etc/resolv.conf inside jails for DNS. This is needed
    so jails can resolve the URLs of distfiles when downloading. It is
    not needed when using a proxy. Refer to the default configuration
    file for proxy configuration.

10.6.3. Creating poudriere Jails

Create the base jails which poudriere will use for building:

    # poudriere jail -c -j 131Ramd64 -v 13.1-RELEASE -a amd64

Fetch a 13.1-RELEASE for amd64 from the FTP server given by FREEBSD_HOST
in poudriere.conf, create the zfs file system
tank/poudriere/jails/131Ramd64, mount it on /poudriere/jails/131Ramd64
and extract the 13.1-RELEASE tarballs into this file system.

    # poudriere jail -c -j 12i386 -v stable/12 -a i386 -m git+https

Create tank/poudriere/jails/12i386, mount it on /poudriere/jails/12i386,
then check out the tip of the Git branch of FreeBSD-12-STABLE from
GIT_HOST in poudriere.conf or the default git.freebsd.org into
/poudriere/jails/12i386/usr/src, then complete a buildworld and install
it into /poudriere/jails/12i386.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | While it is possible to build a   |
|                                   | newer version of FreeBSD on an    |
|                                   | older version, most of the time   |
|                                   | it will not run. For example, if  |
|                                   | a stable/13 jail is needed, the   |
|                                   | host will have to run stable/13   |
|                                   | too. Running 13.1-RELEASE is not  |
|                                   | enough.                           |

A list of jails currently known to poudriere can be shown with
poudriere jail -l:

    # poudriere jail -l
    JAILNAME             VERSION              ARCH    METHOD
    131Ramd64            13.1-RELEASE         amd64   ftp
    12i386               12.4-STABLE          i386    git+https

10.6.4. Keeping poudriere Jails Updated

Managing updates is very straightforward. The command:

    # poudriere jail -u -j JAILNAME

updates the specified jail to the latest version available. For FreeBSD
releases, update to the latest patchlevel with freebsd-update(8). For
FreeBSD versions built from source, update to the latest git revision in
the branch.

|                                   | method, it is helpful to add      |

|                                   | jobs used. For example, if the    |
|                                   | building machine has 6 CPUs, use: |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   |     # p                           |
|                                   | oudriere jail -u -J 6 -j JAILNAME |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

10.6.5. Setting Up Ports Trees for Use with poudriere

There are multiple ways to use ports trees in poudriere. The most
straightforward way is to have poudriere create a default ports tree for
itself, using Git:

    # poudriere ports -c -m git+https -B main

These commands create tank/poudriere/ports/default, mount it on
/poudriere/ports/default, and populate it using Git. Afterward it is
included in the list of known ports trees:

    # poudriere ports -l
    PORTSTREE METHOD    TIMESTAMP           PATH
    default   git+https 2020-07-20 04:23:56 /poudriere/ports/default

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Note that the "default" ports     |
|                                   | tree is special. Each of the      |
|                                   | build commands explained later    |
|                                   | will implicitly use this ports    |
|                                   | tree unless specifically          |
|                                   | specified otherwise. To use       |
|                                   | another tree, add -p treename to  |
|                                   | the commands.                     |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

The best way to deal with local modifications for a ports contributor is
to use Git. As with the creation of jails, it is possible to use a
different method for creating the ports tree. To add an additional ports
tree for testing local modifications and ports development, checking out
the tree via git (as described above) is preferable.

10.6.6. Using Manually Managed Ports Trees with poudriere

Depending on the workflow, it can be extremely helpful to use ports
trees which are maintained manually. For instance, if there is a local
copy of the ports tree in /work/ports, point poudriere to the location:

    # poudriere ports -c -m null -M /work/ports -p development

This will be listed in the table of known trees:

    # poudriere ports -l
    PORTSTREE   METHOD    TIMESTAMP           PATH
    development null      2020-07-20 05:06:33 /work/ports

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | The dash or null in the METHOD    |
|                                   | column means that poudriere will  |
|                                   | not update or change this ports   |
|                                   | tree, ever. It is completely up   |
|                                   | to the user to maintain this      |
|                                   | tree, including all local         |
|                                   | modifications that may be used    |
|                                   | for testing new ports and         |
|                                   | submitting patches.               |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

10.6.7. Keeping poudriere Ports Trees Updated

As straightforward as with jails described earlier:

    # poudriere ports -u -p PORTSTREE

Will update the given PORTSTREE, one tree given by the output of
poudriere -l, to the latest revision available on the official servers.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Ports trees without a method, see |
|                                   | Using Manually Managed Ports      |
|                                   | Trees with poudriere, cannot be   |
|                                   | updated like this and must be     |
|                                   | updated manually by the porter.   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

10.6.8. Testing Ports

After jails and ports trees have been set up, the result of a
contributor’s modifications to the ports tree can be tested.

For example, local modifications to the www/firefox port located in
/work/ports/www/firefox can be tested in the previously created
13.1-RELEASE jail:

    # poudriere testport -j 131Ramd64 -p development -o www/firefox

This will build all dependencies of Firefox. If a dependency has been
built previously and is still up-to-date, the pre-built package is
installed. If a dependency has no up-to-date package, one will be built
with default options in a jail. Then Firefox itself is built.

The complete build of every port is logged to
/poudriere/data/logs/bulk/131Ri386-development/build-time/logs.

The directory name 131Ri386-development is derived from the arguments to
-j and -p, respectively. For convenience, a symbolic link
/poudriere/data/logs/bulk/131Ri386-development/latest is also
maintained. The link points to the latest build-time directory. Also in
this directory is an index.html for observing the build process with a
web browser.

By default, poudriere cleans up the jails and leaves log files in the
directories mentioned above. To ease investigation, jails can be kept
running after the build by adding -i to testport:

    # poudriere testport -j 131Ramd64 -p development -i -o www/firefox

After the build completes, and regardless of whether it was successful,
a shell is provided within the jail. The shell is used to investigate
further. poudriere can be told to leave the jail running after the build
finishes with -I. poudriere will show the command to run when the jail
is no longer needed. It is then possible to jexec(8) into it:

    # poudriere testport -j 131Ramd64 -p development -I -o www/firefox
    [...]
    ====>> Installing local Pkg repository to /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos
    ====>> Leaving jail 131Ramd64-development-n running, mounted at /poudriere/data/.m/131Ramd64-development/ref for interactive run testing
    ====>> To enter jail: jexec 131Ramd64-development-n env -i TERM=$TERM /usr/bin/login -fp root
    ====>> To stop jail: poudriere jail -k -j 131Ramd64 -p development
    # jexec 131Ramd64-development-n env -i TERM=$TERM /usr/bin/login -fp root
    # [do some stuff in the jail]
    # exit
    # poudriere jail -k -j 131Ramd64 -p development
    ====>> Umounting file systems

An integral part of the FreeBSD ports build infrastructure is the
ability to tweak ports to personal preferences with options. These can
be tested with poudriere as well. Adding the -c:

    # poudriere testport -c -o www/firefox

Presents the port configuration dialog before the port is built. The
ports given after -o in the format category/portname will use the
specified options, all dependencies will use the default options.
Testing dependent ports with non-default options can be accomplished
using sets, see Using Sets.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | When testing ports where          |
|                                   | pkg-plist is altered during build |
|                                   | depending on the selected         |
|                                   | options, it is recommended to     |
|                                   | perform a test run with all       |
|                                   | options selected and one with all |
|                                   | options deselected.               |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

10.6.9. Using Sets

For all actions involving builds, a so-called set can be specified using
-z setname. A set refers to a fully independent build. This allows, for
instance, usage of testport with non-standard options for the dependent
ports.

To use sets, poudriere expects an existing directory structure similar
to PORT_DBDIR, defaults to /var/db/ports in its configuration directory.
This directory is then nullfs(5)-mounted into the jails where the ports
and their dependencies are built. Usually a suitable starting point can
be obtained by recursively copying the existing PORT_DBDIR to
/usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/jailname-portname-setname-options. This is
described in detail in poudriere(8). For instance, testing www/firefox
in a specific set named devset, add the -z devset parameter to the
testport command:

    # poudriere testport -j 131Ramd64 -p development -z devset -o www/firefox

This will look for the existence of these directories in this order:

-   /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/131Ramd64-development-devset-options

-   /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/131Ramd64-devset-options

-   /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/131Ramd64-development-options

-   /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/devset-options

-   /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/development-options

-   /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/131Ramd64-options

-   /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/options

From this list, poudriere nullfs(5)-mounts the first existing directory
tree into the /var/db/ports directory of the build jails. Hence, all
custom options are used for all the ports during this run of testport.

After the directory structure for a set is provided, the options for a
particular port can be altered. For example:

    # poudriere options -c www/firefox -z devset

The configuration dialog for www/firefox is shown, and options can be
edited. The selected options are saved to the devset set.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | poudriere is very flexible in the |
|                                   | option configuration. poudriere   |
|                                   | can be set for particular jails,  |
|                                   | ports trees, and for multiple     |
|                                   | ports by one command. Refer to    |
|                                   | poudriere(8) for details.         |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

10.6.10. Providing a Custom make.conf File

Similar to using sets, poudriere will also use a custom make.conf if it
is provided. No special command line argument is necessary. Instead,
poudriere looks for existing files matching a name scheme derived from
the command line. For instance:

    # poudriere testport -j 131Ramd64 -p development -z devset -o www/firefox

causes poudriere to check for the existence of these files in this
order:

-   /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/make.conf

-   /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/devset-make.conf

-   /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/development-make.conf

-   /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/131Ramd64-make.conf

-   /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/131Ramd64-development-make.conf

-   /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/131Ramd64-devset-make.conf

-   /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/131Ramd64-development-devset-make.conf

Unlike with sets, all of the found files will be appended, in that
order, into one make.conf inside the build jails. It is hence possible
to have general make variables, intended to affect all builds in
/usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/make.conf. Special variables, intended to
affect only certain jails or sets can be set in specialised make.conf
files, such as
/usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/131Ramd64-development-devset-make.conf.

Example 113. Using make.conf to Change Default Perl

To build a set with a non default Perl version, for example, 5.20, using
a set named perl5-20, create a perl5-20-make.conf with this line:

    DEFAULT_VERSIONS+= perl=5.20

Note the use of += so that if the variable is already set in the default
make.conf its content will not be overwritten.

10.6.11. Pruning no Longer Needed Distfiles

poudriere comes with a built-in mechanism to remove outdated distfiles
that are no longer used by any port of a given tree. The command

    # poudriere distclean -p portstree

will scan the distfiles folder, DISTFILES_CACHE in poudriere.conf,
versus the ports tree given by the -p portstree argument and prompt for
removal of those distfiles. To skip the prompt and remove all unused
files unconditionally, the -y argument can be added:

    # poudriere distclean -p portstree -y

Chapter 11. Upgrading a Port

When a port is not the most recent version available from the authors,
update the local working copy of /usr/ports. The port might have already
been updated to the new version.

When working with more than a few ports, it will probably be easier to
use Git to keep the whole ports collection up-to-date, as described in
the Handbook. This will have the added benefit of tracking all the
port’s dependencies.

The next step is to see if there is an update already pending. To do
this, there are two options. There is a searchable interface to the
FreeBSD Problem Report (PR) or bug database. Select Ports & Packages in
the Product multiple select menu, and enter the name of the port in the
Summary field.

If there is no pending PR, the next step is to send an email to the
port’s maintainer, as shown by make maintainer. That person may already
be working on an upgrade, or have a reason to not upgrade the port right
now (because of, for example, stability problems of the new version),
and there is no need to duplicate their work. Note that unmaintained
ports are listed with a maintainer of ports@FreeBSD.org, which is just
the general ports mailing list, so sending mail there probably will not
help in this case.

If the maintainer asks you to do the upgrade or there is no maintainer,
then help out FreeBSD by preparing the update! Please do this by using
the diff(1) command in the base system.

To create a suitable diff for a single patch, copy the file that needs
patching to something.orig, save the changes to something and then
create the patch:

    % diff -u something.orig something > something.diff

Otherwise, either use the git diff method (Using Git to Make Patches) or
copy the contents of the port to an entire different directory and use
the result of the recursive diff(1) output of the new and old ports
directories (for example, if the modified port directory is called
superedit and the original is in our tree as superedit.bak, then save
the result of diff -ruN superedit.bak superedit). Either unified or
context diff is fine, but port committers generally prefer unified
diffs. Note the use of the -N option-this is the accepted way to force
diff to properly deal with the case of new files being added or old
files being deleted. Before sending us the diff, please examine the
output to make sure all the changes make sense. (In particular, make
sure to first clean out the work directories with make clean).

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | If some files have been added,    |
|                                   | copied, moved, or removed, add    |
|                                   | this information to the problem   |
|                                   | report so that the committer      |
|                                   | picking up the patch will know    |
|                                   | what git(1) commands to run.      |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

To simplify common operations with patch files, use make makepatch as
described in Patching. Other tools exists, like
/usr/ports/Tools/scripts/patchtool.py. Before using it, please read
/usr/ports/Tools/scripts/README.patchtool.

If the port is unmaintained, and you are actively using it, please
consider volunteering to become its maintainer. FreeBSD has over 4000
ports without maintainers, and this is an area where more volunteers are
always needed. (For a detailed description of the responsibilities of
maintainers, refer to the section in the Developer’s Handbook.)

To submit the diff, use the bug submit form (product Ports & Packages,
component Individual Port(s)). Always include the category with the port
name, followed by colon, and brief descripton of the issue. Examples:
category/portname: add FOO option; category/portname: Update to X.Y.
Please mention any added or deleted files in the message, as they have
to be explicitly specified to git(1) when doing a commit. Do not
compress or encode the diff.

Before submitting the bug, review the Writing the problem report section
in the Problem Reports article. It contains far more information about
how to write useful problem reports.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Now that all of that is done, read about how to keep up-to-date in
Keeping Up.

11.1. Using Git to Make Patches

When possible, please submit a git(1) patch or diff. They are easier to
handle than diffs between "new and old" directories. It is easier to see
what has changed, and to update the diff if something was modified in
the Ports Collection since the work on it began, or if the committer
asks for something to be fixed. Also, a patch generated with
git-format-patch(1) or git-diff(1) can be easily applied with git-am(1)
or git-apply(1) and will save some time for the committer. Finally, the
git patch generated by git-format-patch(1) includes your author
information and commit messages. These will be recorded in the log of
the repository and this is the recommended way to submit your changes.

    % git clone https://git.FreeBSD.org/ports.git ~/my_wrkdir  (1) (2)
    % cd ~/my_wrkdir

  --- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1   This can be anywhere, of course. Building ports is not limited to within /usr/ports/.
  2   git.FreeBSD.org is the FreeBSD public Git server. See FreeBSD Git Repository URL Table for more information.
  --- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While in the port directory, make any changes that are needed. If
adding, moving, or removing a file, use git to track these changes:

    % git add new_file
    % git mv old_name new_name
    % git rm deleted_file

Make sure to check the port using the checklist in Testing the Port and
Checking the Port with portlint.

Also, update the checksum reference in distinfo with make makesum.

Before making the patch, fetch the latest repository and rebase the
changes on top of it. Watch and follow the output carefully. If any of
the files failed to rebase, it means that the upstream files changed
while you were editing the same file, and the conflicts need to be
resolved manually.

    % git fetch origin main
    % git rebase origin/main

Check the changes staged for the patch:

    % git status
    % git diff --staged

The last step is to make an unified diff or patch of the changes:

To generate a patch with git-format-patch(1):

    % git checkout -b my_branch
    % git commit
    % git format-patch main

This will generate a patch named like 0001-foo.patch. This is the
preferred way as it would include author identity, and it is also easier
when you are making a series of changes that are not meant to be
squashed together.

Alternatively, to generate an unified diff with git-diff(1):

    % git diff --staged > ../`make -VPKGNAME`.diff

This will generate a diff named like foo-1.2.3.diff. Where foo is
replaced with the first line of the commit message, i.e., the subject of
the commit message.

After patch has been created, you can switch to the main branch for
starting other developments.

    % git checkout main

Once the patch is accepted and merged, you can delete the local
development branch if you want:

    % git branch -D my_branch

|                                   | after the patch is applied.       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Send the patch following the problem report submission guidelines.

11.2. UPDATING and MOVED

11.2.1. /usr/ports/UPDATING

If upgrading the port requires special steps like changing configuration
files or running a specific program, it must be documented in this file.
The format of an entry in this file is:

    YYYYMMDD:
      AFFECTS: users of portcategory/portname
      AUTHOR: Your name <Your email address>

      Special instructions

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

|                                   | As shown, the command will only   |
|                                   | work with bourne shells. Instead, |
|                                   | use the form shown below, which   |
|                                   | will work with both bourne shell  |
|                                   | and c-shell:                      |
|                                   |                                   |

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | It is recommended that the        |
|                                   | AFFECTS line contains a glob      |
|                                   | matching all the ports affected   |
|                                   | by the entry so that automated    |
|                                   | tools can parse it as easily as   |
|                                   | possible. If an update concerns   |
|                                   | all the existing BIND 9 versions  |
|                                   | the AFFECTS content must be       |
|                                   | users of dns/bind9*, it must not  |
|                                   | be users of BIND 9                |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

11.2.2. /usr/ports/MOVED

This file is used to list moved or removed ports. Each line in the file
is made up of the name of the port, where the port was moved, when, and
why. If the port was removed, the section detailing where it was moved
can be left blank. Each section must be separated by the | (pipe)
character, like so:

    old name|new name (blank for deleted)|date of move|reason

The date must be entered in the form YYYY-MM-DD. New entries are added
to the end of the list to keep it in chronological order, with the
oldest entry at the top of the list.

If a port was removed but has since been restored, delete the line in
this file that states that it was removed.

If a port was renamed and then renamed back to its original name, add a
new one with the intermediate name to the old name, and remove the old
entry as to not create a loop.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Any changes must be validated     |
|                                   | with Tools/scripts/MOVEDlint.awk. |

Chapter 12. Security

12.1. Why Security is So Important

Bugs are occasionally introduced to the software. Arguably, the most
dangerous of them are those opening security vulnerabilities. From the
technical viewpoint, such vulnerabilities are to be closed by
exterminating the bugs that caused them. However, the policies for
handling mere bugs and security vulnerabilities are very different.

A typical small bug affects only those users who have enabled some
combination of options triggering the bug. The developer will eventually
release a patch followed by a new version of the software, free of the
bug, but the majority of users will not take the trouble of upgrading
immediately because the bug has never vexed them. A critical bug that
may cause data loss represents a graver issue. Nevertheless, prudent
users know that a lot of possible accidents, besides software bugs, are
likely to lead to data loss, and so they make backups of important data;
in addition, a critical bug will be discovered really soon.

A security vulnerability is all different. First, it may remain
unnoticed for years because often it does not cause software
malfunction. Second, a malicious party can use it to gain unauthorized
access to a vulnerable system, to destroy or alter sensitive data; and
in the worst case the user will not even notice the harm caused. Third,
exposing a vulnerable system often assists attackers to break into other
systems that could not be compromised otherwise. Therefore closing a
vulnerability alone is not enough: notify the audience of it in the most
clear and comprehensive manner, which will allow them to evaluate the
danger and take appropriate action.

12.2. Fixing Security Vulnerabilities

While on the subject of ports and packages, a security vulnerability may
initially appear in the original distribution or in the port files. In
the former case, the original software developer is likely to release a
patch or a new version instantly. Update the port promptly with respect
to the author’s fix. If the fix is delayed for some reason, either mark
the port as FORBIDDEN or introduce a patch file to the port. In the case
of a vulnerable port, just fix the port as soon as possible. In either
case, follow the standard procedure for submitting changes unless having
rights to commit it directly to the ports tree.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Being a ports committer is not    |
|                                   | enough to commit to an arbitrary  |
|                                   | port. Remember that ports usually |
|                                   | have maintainers, must be         |
|                                   | respected.                        |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Please make sure that the port’s revision is bumped as soon as the
vulnerability has been closed. That is how the users who upgrade
installed packages on a regular basis will see they need to run an
update. Besides, a new package will be built and distributed over FTP
and WWW mirrors, replacing the vulnerable one. Bump PORTREVISION unless
DISTVERSION has changed in the course of correcting the vulnerability.
That is, bump PORTREVISION if adding a patch file to the port, but do
not bump it if updating the port to the latest software version and thus
already touched DISTVERSION. Please refer to the corresponding section
for more information.

12.3. Keeping the Community Informed

12.3.1. The VuXML Database

A very important and urgent step to take as early after a security
vulnerability is discovered as possible is to notify the community of
port users about the jeopardy. Such notification serves two purposes.
First, if the danger is really severe it will be wise to apply an
instant workaround. For example, stop the affected network service or
even deinstall the port completely until the vulnerability is closed.
Second, a lot of users tend to upgrade installed packages only
occasionally. They will know from the notification that they must update
the package without delay as soon as a corrected version is available.

Given the huge number of ports in the tree, a security advisory cannot
be issued on each incident without creating a flood and losing the
attention of the audience when it comes to really serious matters.
Therefore security vulnerabilities found in ports are recorded in the
FreeBSD VuXML database. The Security Officer Team members also monitor
it for issues requiring their intervention.

Committers can update the VuXML database themselves, assisting the
Security Officer Team and delivering crucial information to the
community more quickly. Those who are not committers or have discovered
an exceptionally severe vulnerability should not hesitate to contact the
Security Officer Team directly, as described on the FreeBSD Security
Information page.

The VuXML database is an XML document. Its source file vuln.xml is kept
right inside the port security/vuxml. Therefore the file’s full pathname
will be PORTSDIR/security/vuxml/vuln.xml. Each time a security
vulnerability is discovered in a port, please add an entry for it to
that file. Until familiar with VuXML, the best thing to do is to find an
existing entry fitting the case at hand, then copy it and use it as a
template.

12.3.2. A Short Introduction to VuXML

The full-blown XML format is complex, and far beyond the scope of this
book. However, to gain basic insight on the structure of a VuXML entry
only the notion of tags is needed. XML tag names are enclosed in angle
brackets. Each opening <tag> must have a matching closing </tag>. Tags
may be nested. If nesting, the inner tags must be closed before the
outer ones. There is a hierarchy of tags, that is, more complex rules of
nesting them. This is similar to HTML. The major difference is that XML
is eXtensible, that is, based on defining custom tags. Due to its
intrinsic structure XML puts otherwise amorphous data into shape. VuXML
is particularly tailored to mark up descriptions of security
vulnerabilities.

Now consider a realistic VuXML entry:

    <vuln vid="f4bc80f4-da62-11d8-90ea-0004ac98a7b9"> (1)
      <topic>Several vulnerabilities found in Foo</topic> (2)

        </package>
        <package>

    </vuln>

The tag names are supposed to be self-explanatory so we shall take a
closer look only at fields which needs to be filled in:

  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  1                                   This is the top-level tag of a
                                      VuXML entry. It has a mandatory
                                      attribute, vid, specifying a
                                      universally unique identifier
                                      (UUID) for this entry (in quotes).
                                      Generate a UUID for each new VuXML
                                      entry (and do not forget to
                                      substitute it for the template UUID
                                      unless writing the entry from
                                      scratch). Use uuidgen(1) to
                                      generate a VuXML UUID.

  2                                   This is a one-line description of
                                      the issue found.

  3                                   The names of packages affected are
                                      listed there. Multiple names can be
                                      given since several packages may be
                                      based on a single master port or
                                      software product. This may include
                                      stable and development branches,
                                      localized versions, and slave ports
                                      featuring different choices of
                                      important build-time configuration
                                      options.

  4                                   Affected versions of the package(s)
                                      are specified there as one or more
                                      ranges using a combination of <lt>,
                                      <le>, <eq>, <ge>, and <gt>
                                      elements. Check that the version
                                      ranges given do not overlap.
                                      In a range specification, *
                                      (asterisk) denotes the smallest
                                      version number. In particular, 2.*
                                      is less than 2.a. Therefore an
                                      asterisk may be used for a range to
                                      match all possible alpha, beta, and
                                      RC versions. For instance,
                                      <ge>2.</ge><lt>3.</lt> will
                                      selectively match every 2.x version
                                      while <ge>2.0</ge><lt>3.0</lt> will
                                      not since the latter misses 2.r3
                                      and matches 3.b.
                                      The above example specifies that
                                      affected are versions 1.6 and up to
                                      but not including 1.9, versions 2.x
                                      before 2.4_1, and version 3.0b1.

  5                                   Several related package groups
                                      (essentially, ports) can be listed
                                      in the <affected> section. This can
                                      be used if several software
                                      products (say FooBar, FreeBar and
                                      OpenBar) grow from the same code
                                      base and still share its bugs and
                                      vulnerabilities. Note the
                                      difference from listing multiple
                                      names within a single <package>
                                      section.

  6                                   The version ranges have to allow
                                      for PORTEPOCH and PORTREVISION if
                                      applicable. Please remember that
                                      according to the collation rules, a
                                      version with a non-zero PORTEPOCH
                                      is greater than any version without
                                      PORTEPOCH, for example, 3.0,1 is
                                      greater than 3.1 or even than 8.9.

  7                                   This is a summary of the issue.

  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------

12.3.3. Testing Changes to the VuXML Database

This example describes a new entry for a vulnerability in the package
dropbear that has been fixed in version dropbear-2013.59.

As a prerequisite, install a fresh version of security/vuxml port.

First, check whether there already is an entry for this vulnerability.
If there were such an entry, it would match the previous version of the
package, 2013.58:

    % pkg audit dropbear-2013.58

If there is none found, add a new entry for this vulnerability.

    % cd ${PORTSDIR}/security/vuxml
    % make newentry

If the vulnerability has a MITRE CVE identifier, the following command
can be used instead:

    % cd ${PORTSDIR}/security/vuxml
    % make newentry CVE_ID=CVE-YYYY-XXXXX

where CVE-YYYYY-XXXX is a valid CVE identifier.

Verify its syntax and formatting:

    % make validate

The previous command generates the vuln-flat.xml file. It can also be
generated with:

    % make vuln-flat.xml

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | At least one of these packages    |
|                                   | needs to be installed:            |
|                                   | textproc/libxml2, textproc/jade.  |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Verify that the <affected> section of the entry will match the correct
packages:

    % pkg audit -f ${PORTSDIR}/security/vuxml/vuln-flat.xml dropbear-2013.58

Make sure that the entry produces no spurious matches in the output.

Now check whether the right package versions are matched by the entry:

    % pkg audit -f ${PORTSDIR}/security/vuxml/vuln-flat.xml dropbear-2013.58 dropbear-2013.59
    dropbear-2012.58 is vulnerable:
    dropbear -- exposure of sensitive information, DoS
    CVE: CVE-2013-4434
    CVE: CVE-2013-4421
    WWW: https://portaudit.FreeBSD.org/8c9b48d1-3715-11e3-a624-00262d8b701d.html

    1 problem(s) in the installed packages found.

The former version matches while the latter one does not.

Chapter 13. Dos and Don’ts

13.1. Introduction

Here is a list of common dos and don’ts that are encountered during the
porting process. Check the port against this list, but also check ports
in the PR database that others have submitted. Submit any comments on
ports as described in Bug Reports and General Commentary. Checking ports
in the PR database will both make it faster for us to commit them, and
prove that you know what you are doing.

13.2. WRKDIR

Do not write anything to files outside WRKDIR. WRKDIR is the only place
that is guaranteed to be writable during the port build (see installing
ports from a CDROM for an example of building ports from a read-only
tree). The pkg-* files can be modified by redefining a variable rather
than overwriting the file.

13.3. WRKDIRPREFIX

Make sure the port honors WRKDIRPREFIX. Most ports do not have to worry
about this. In particular, when referring to a WRKDIR of another port,
note that the correct location is
${WRKDIRPREFIX}${PORTSDIR}/subdir/name/work not
${PORTSDIR}/subdir/name/work or ${.CURDIR}/../../subdir/name/work or
some such.

13.4. Differentiating Operating Systems and OS Versions

Some code needs modifications or conditional compilation based upon what
version of FreeBSD Unix it is running under. The preferred way to tell
FreeBSD versions apart are the __FreeBSD_version and __FreeBSD__ macros
defined in sys/param.h. If this file is not included add the code,

    #include <sys/param.h>

to the proper place in the .c file.

__FreeBSD__ is defined in all versions of FreeBSD as their major version
number. For example, in FreeBSD 9.x, __FreeBSD__ is defined to be 9.

    #if __FreeBSD__ >= 9
    #  if __FreeBSD_version >= 901000
         /* 9.1+ release specific code here */
    #  endif
    #endif

A complete list of __FreeBSD_version values is available in
__FreeBSD_version Values.

13.5. Writing Something After bsd.port.mk

Do not write anything after the .include <bsd.port.mk> line. It usually
can be avoided by including bsd.port.pre.mk somewhere in the middle of
the Makefile and bsd.port.post.mk at the end.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Include either the                |
|                                   | bsd.port.pre.mk/bsd.port.post.mk  |
|                                   | pair or bsd.port.mk only; do not  |
|                                   | mix these two usages.             |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

bsd.port.pre.mk only defines a few variables, which can be used in tests
in the Makefile, bsd.port.post.mk defines the rest.

Here are some important variables defined in bsd.port.pre.mk (this is
not the complete list, please read bsd.port.mk for the complete list).

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Variable                          | Description                       |
+===================================+===================================+
| ARCH                              | The architecture as returned by   |
|                                   | uname -m (for example, i386)      |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| OPSYS                             | The operating system type, as     |
|                                   | returned by uname -s (for         |
|                                   | example, FreeBSD)                 |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| OSREL                             | The release version of the        |
|                                   | operating system (for example,    |
|                                   | 2.1.5 or 2.2.7)                   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| OSVERSION                         | The numeric version of the        |
|                                   | operating system; the same as     |
|                                   | __FreeBSD_version.                |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| LOCALBASE                         | The base of the "local" tree (for |
|                                   | example, /usr/local)              |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| PREFIX                            | Where the port installs itself    |
|                                   | (see more on PREFIX).             |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | When MASTERDIR is needed, always  |
|                                   | define it before including        |
|                                   | bsd.port.pre.mk.                  |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Here are some examples of things that can be added after
bsd.port.pre.mk:

    # no need to compile lang/perl5 if perl5 is already in system
    .if ${OSVERSION} > 300003
    BROKEN= perl is in system
    .endif

Always use tab instead of spaces after BROKEN=.

13.6. Use the exec Statement in Wrapper Scripts

If the port installs a shell script whose purpose is to launch another
program, and if launching that program is the last action performed by
the script, make sure to launch the program using the exec statement,
for instance:

    #!/bin/sh
    exec %%LOCALBASE%%/bin/java -jar %%DATADIR%%/foo.jar "$@"

The exec statement replaces the shell process with the specified
program. If exec is omitted, the shell process remains in memory while
the program is executing, and needlessly consumes system resources.

13.7. Do Things Rationally

The Makefile should do things in a simple and reasonable manner. Making
it a couple of lines shorter or more readable is always better. Examples
include using a make .if construct instead of a shell if construct, not
redefining do-extract if redefining EXTRACT* is enough, and using
GNU_CONFIGURE instead of CONFIGURE_ARGS += --prefix=${PREFIX}.

If a lot of new code is needed to do something, there may already be an
implementation of it in bsd.port.mk. While hard to read, there are a
great many seemingly-hard problems for which bsd.port.mk already
provides a shorthand solution.

13.8. Respect Both CC and CXX

The port must respect both CC and CXX. What we mean by this is that the
port must not set the values of these variables absolutely, overriding
existing values; instead, it may append whatever values it needs to the
existing values. This is so that build options that affect all ports can
be set globally.

If the port does not respect these variables, please add
NO_PACKAGE=ignores either cc or cxx to the Makefile.

Here is an example of a Makefile respecting both CC and CXX. Note the
?=:

    CC?= gcc

    CXX?= g++

Here is an example which respects neither CC nor CXX:

    CC= gcc

    CXX= g++

Both CC and CXX can be defined on FreeBSD systems in /etc/make.conf. The
first example defines a value if it was not previously set in
/etc/make.conf, preserving any system-wide definitions. The second
example clobbers anything previously defined.

13.9. Respect CFLAGS

The port must respect CFLAGS. What we mean by this is that the port must
not set the value of this variable absolutely, overriding the existing
value. Instead, it may append whatever values it needs to the existing
value. This is so that build options that affect all ports can be set
globally.

If it does not, please add NO_PACKAGE=ignores cflags to the Makefile.

Here is an example of a Makefile respecting CFLAGS. Note the +=:

    CFLAGS+= -Wall -Werror

Here is an example which does not respect CFLAGS:

    CFLAGS= -Wall -Werror

CFLAGS is defined on FreeBSD systems in /etc/make.conf. The first
example appends additional flags to CFLAGS, preserving any system-wide
definitions. The second example clobbers anything previously defined.

Remove optimization flags from the third party Makefiles. The system
CFLAGS contains system-wide optimization flags. An example from an
unmodified Makefile:

    CFLAGS= -O3 -funroll-loops -DHAVE_SOUND

Using system optimization flags, the Makefile would look similar to this
example:

    CFLAGS+= -DHAVE_SOUND

13.10. Verbose Build Logs

Make the port build system display all commands executed during the
build stage. Complete build logs are crucial to debugging port problems.

Non-informative build log example (bad):

      CC     source1.o
      CC     source2.o
      CCLD   someprogram

Verbose build log example (good):

    cc -O2 -pipe -I/usr/local/include -c -o source1.o source1.c
    cc -O2 -pipe -I/usr/local/include -c -o source2.o source2.c
    cc -o someprogram source1.o source2.o -L/usr/local/lib -lsomelib

Some build systems such as CMake, ninja, and GNU configure are set up
for verbose logging by the ports framework. In other cases, ports might
need individual tweaks.

13.11. Feedback

Do send applicable changes and patches to the upstream maintainer for
inclusion in the next release of the code. This makes updating to the
next release that much easier.

13.12. README.html

README.html is not part of the port, but generated by make readme. Do
not include this file in patches or commits.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | If make readme fails, make sure   |
|                                   | that the default value of         |
|                                   | ECHO_MSG has not been modified by |
|                                   | the port.                         |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

13.13. Marking a Port Not Installable with BROKEN, FORBIDDEN, or IGNORE

In certain cases, users must be prevented from installing a port. There
are several variables that can be used in a port’s Makefile to tell the
user that the port cannot be installed. The value of these make
variables will be the reason that is shown to users for why the port
refuses to install itself. Please use the correct make variable. Each
variable conveys radically different meanings, both to users and to
automated systems that depend on Makefiles, such as the ports build
cluster, and FreshPorts.

13.13.1. Variables

-   BROKEN is reserved for ports that currently do not compile, install,
    deinstall, or run correctly. Use it for ports where the problem is
    believed to be temporary.

    If instructed, the build cluster will still attempt to try to build
    them to see if the underlying problem has been resolved. (However,
    in general, the cluster is run without this.)

    For instance, use BROKEN when a port:

    -   does not compile

    -   fails its configuration or installation process

    -   installs files outside of ${PREFIX}

    -   does not remove all its files cleanly upon deinstall (however,
        it may be acceptable, and desirable, for the port to leave
        user-modified files behind)

    -   has runtime issues on systems where it is supposed to run fine.

-   FORBIDDEN is used for ports that contain a security vulnerability or
    induce grave concern regarding the security of a FreeBSD system with
    a given port installed (for example, a reputably insecure program or
    a program that provides easily exploitable services). Mark ports as
    FORBIDDEN as soon as a particular piece of software has a
    vulnerability and there is no released upgrade. Ideally upgrade
    ports as soon as possible when a security vulnerability is
    discovered so as to reduce the number of vulnerable FreeBSD hosts
    (we like being known for being secure), however sometimes there is a
    noticeable time gap between disclosure of a vulnerability and an
    updated release of the vulnerable software. Do not mark a port
    FORBIDDEN for any reason other than security.

-   IGNORE is reserved for ports that must not be built for some other
    reason. Use it for ports where the problem is believed to be
    structural. The build cluster will not, under any circumstances,
    build ports marked as IGNORE. For instance, use IGNORE when a port:

    -   does not work on the installed version of FreeBSD

    -   has a distfile which may not be automatically fetched due to
        licensing restrictions

    -   does not work with some other currently installed port (for
        instance, the port depends on www/drupal7 but www/drupal8 is
        installed)

        |                                   | set IGNORE by itself.             |
        +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

13.13.2. Implementation Notes

Do not quote the values of BROKEN, IGNORE, and related variables. Due to
the way the information is shown to the user, the wording of messages
for each variable differ:

    BROKEN=    fails to link with base -lcrypto

    IGNORE=  unsupported on recent versions

resulting in this output from make describe:

    ===>  foobar-0.1 is marked as broken: fails to link with base -lcrypto.

    ===>  foobar-0.1 is unsupported on recent versions.

13.14. Architectural Considerations

13.14.1. General Notes on Architectures

FreeBSD runs on many more processor architectures than just the
well-known x86-based ones. Some ports have constraints which are
particular to one or more of these architectures.

For the list of supported architectures, run:

    cd ${SRCDIR}; make targets

The values are shown in the form TARGET/TARGET_ARCH. The ports read-only
makevar ARCH is set based on the value of TARGET_ARCH. Port Makefiles
should test the value of this Makevar.

13.14.2. Marking a Port as Architecture Neutral

Ports that do not have any architecture-dependent files or requirements
are identified by setting NO_ARCH=yes.

Packages built from such ports have their architecture string ending in
:* (wildcard architecture) as opposed to, for example, freebsd:13:x86:64
(amd64 architecture).

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | NO_ARCH is meant to indicate that |
|                                   | there is no need to build a       |
|                                   | package for each of the supported |
|                                   | architectures. The goal is to     |
|                                   | reduce the amount of resources    |
|                                   | spent on building and             |
|                                   | distributing the packages such as |
|                                   | network bandwidth and disk space  |
|                                   | on mirrors and on distribution    |
|                                   | media. Currently, however, our    |
|                                   | package infrastructure (e.g.,     |
|                                   | package managers, mirrors, and    |
|                                   | package builders) is not set up   |
|                                   | to fully benefit from NO_ARCH.    |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

13.14.3. Marking a Port as Ignored Only On Certain Architectures

-   To mark a port as IGNOREd only on certain architectures, there are
    two other convenience variables that will automatically set IGNORE:
    ONLY_FOR_ARCHS and NOT_FOR_ARCHS. Examples:

        ONLY_FOR_ARCHS= i386 amd64

        NOT_FOR_ARCHS= ia64 sparc64

    A custom IGNORE message can be set using ONLY_FOR_ARCHS_REASON and
    NOT_FOR_ARCHS_REASON. Per architecture entries are possible with
    ONLY_FOR_ARCHS_REASON_ARCH and NOT_FOR_ARCHS_REASON_ARCH.

-   If a port fetches i386 binaries and installs them, set
    IA32_BINARY_PORT. If this variable is set, /usr/lib32 must be
    present for IA32 versions of libraries and the kernel must support
    IA32 compatibility. If one of these two dependencies is not
    satisfied, IGNORE will be set automatically.

13.14.4. Cluster-Specific Considerations

-   Some ports attempt to tune themselves to the exact machine they are
    being built on by specifying -march=native to the compiler. This
    should be avoided: either list it under an off-by-default option, or
    delete it entirely.

    Otherwise, the default package produced by the build cluster might
    not run on every single machine of that ARCH.

13.15. Marking a Port for Removal with DEPRECATED or EXPIRATION_DATE

Do remember that BROKEN and FORBIDDEN are to be used as a temporary
resort if a port is not working. Permanently broken ports will be
removed from the tree entirely.

When it makes sense to do so, users can be warned about a pending port
removal with DEPRECATED and EXPIRATION_DATE. The former is a string
stating why the port is scheduled for removal; the latter is a string in
ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD). Both will be shown to the user.

It is possible to set DEPRECATED without an EXPIRATION_DATE (for
instance, recommending a newer version of the port), but the converse
does not make any sense.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | When marking a port as            |
|                                   | DEPRECATED, if there are any      |
|                                   | alternative ports that can be     |
|                                   | used as a replacement for the one |
|                                   | being deprecated, it is           |
|                                   | convenient to mention them in the |
|                                   | commit message.                   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

There is no set policy on how much notice to give. Current practice
seems to be one month for security-related issues and two months for
build issues. This also gives any interested committers a little time to
fix the problems.

13.16. Avoid Use of the .error Construct

The correct way for a Makefile to signal that the port cannot be
installed due to some external factor (for instance, the user has
specified an illegal combination of build options) is to set a non-blank
value to IGNORE. This value will be formatted and shown to the user by
make install.

It is a common mistake to use .error for this purpose. The problem with
this is that many automated tools that work with the ports tree will
fail in this situation. The most common occurrence of this is seen when
trying to build /usr/ports/INDEX (see Running make describe). However,
even more trivial commands such as make maintainer also fail in this
scenario. This is not acceptable.

Example 114. How to Avoid Using .error

The first of the next two Makefile snippets will cause make index to
fail, while the second one will not:

    .error "option is not supported"

    IGNORE=option is not supported

13.17. Usage of sysctl

The usage of sysctl is discouraged except in targets. This is because
the evaluation of any makevars, such as used during make index, then has
to run the command, further slowing down that process.

Only use sysctl(8) through SYSCTL, as it contains the fully qualified
path and can be overridden, if one has such a special need.

13.18. Rerolling Distfiles

Sometimes the authors of software change the content of released
distfiles without changing the file’s name. Verify that the changes are
official and have been performed by the author. It has happened in the
past that the distfile was silently altered on the download servers with
the intent to cause harm or compromise end user security.

Put the old distfile aside, download the new one, unpack them and
compare the content with diff(1). If there is nothing suspicious, update
distinfo.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Be sure to summarize the          |
|                                   | differences in the PR and commit  |
|                                   | log, so that other people know    |
|                                   | that nothing bad has happened.    |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Contact the authors of the software and confirm the changes with them.

13.19. Use POSIX Standards

FreeBSD ports generally expect POSIX compliance. Some software and build
systems make assumptions based on a particular operating system or
environment that can cause problems when used in a port.

Do not use /proc if there are any other ways of getting the information.
For example, setprogname(argv[0]) in main() and then getprogname(3) to
know the executable name.

Do not rely on behavior that is undocumented by POSIX.

Do not record timestamps in the critical path of the application if it
also works without. Getting timestamps may be slow, depending on the
accuracy of timestamps in the OS. If timestamps are really needed,
determine how precise they have to be and use an API which is documented
to just deliver the needed precision.

A number of simple syscalls (for example gettimeofday(2), getpid(2)) are
much faster on Linux® than on any other operating system due to caching
and the vsyscall performance optimizations. Do not rely on them being
cheap in performance-critical applications. In general, try hard to
avoid syscalls if possible.

Do not rely on Linux®-specific socket behavior. In particular, default
socket buffer sizes are different (call setsockopt(2) with SO_SNDBUF and
SO_RCVBUF, and while Linux®'s send(2) blocks when the socket buffer is
full, FreeBSD’s will fail and set ENOBUFS in errno.

If relying on non-standard behavior is required, encapsulate it properly
into a generic API, do a check for the behavior in the configure stage,
and stop if it is missing.

Check the man pages to see if the function used is a POSIX interface (in
the "STANDARDS" section of the man page).

Do not assume that /bin/sh is bash. Ensure that a command line passed to
system(3) will work with a POSIX compliant shell.

A list of common bashisms is available here.

Check that headers are included in the POSIX or man page recommended
way. For example, sys/types.h is often forgotten, which is not as much
of a problem for Linux® as it is for FreeBSD.

13.20. Miscellanea

Always double-check pkg-descr and pkg-plist. If reviewing a port and a
better wording can be achieved, do so.

Please be careful to note any legal issues! Do not let us illegally
distribute software!

Chapter 14. A Sample Makefile

Here is a sample Makefile that can be used to create a new port. Make
sure to remove all the extra comments (ones between brackets).

The format shown is the recommended one for ordering variables, empty
lines between sections, and so on. This format is designed so that the
most important information is easy to locate. We recommend using
portlint to check the Makefile.

    [section to describe the port itself and the master site - PORTNAME
     and PORTVERSION or the DISTVERSION* variables are always first,
     followed by CATEGORIES, and then MASTER_SITES, which can be followed
     by MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR.  PKGNAMEPREFIX and PKGNAMESUFFIX, if needed,
     will be after that.  Then comes DISTNAME, EXTRACT_SUFX and/or
     DISTFILES, and then EXTRACT_ONLY, as necessary.]
    PORTNAME=   xdvi
    DISTVERSION=    18.2
    CATEGORIES= print
    [do not forget the trailing slash ("/")!
     if not using MASTER_SITE_* macros]

     handle port updates, build breakages, and to whom a users can direct

Chapter 15. Order of Variables in Port Makefiles

The first sections of the Makefile must always come in the same order.
This standard makes it so everyone can easily read any port without
having to search for variables in a random order.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | The sections and variables        |
|                                   | described here are mandatory in a |
|                                   | ordinary port. In a slave port,   |
|                                   | many sections and variables can   |
|                                   | be skipped.                       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Each following block must be      |
|                                   | separated from the previous block |
|                                   | by a single blank line.           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | In the following blocks, only set |
|                                   | the variables that are required   |
|                                   | by the port. Define these         |
|                                   | variables in the order they are   |
|                                   | shown here.                       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

15.1. PORTNAME Block

This block is the most important. It defines the port name, version,
distribution file location, and category. The variables must be in this
order:

-   PORTNAME

-   PKGNAMEPREFIX

-   PKGNAMESUFFIX

-   DISTNAME

-   EXTRACT_SUFX

-   DISTFILES

-   DIST_SUBDIR

-   EXTRACT_ONLY

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Only one of PORTVERSION and       |
|                                   | DISTVERSION can be used.          |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

15.2. PATCHFILES Block

This block is optional. The variables are:

-   PATCH_SITES

-   PATCHFILES

-   PATCH_DIST_STRIP

15.3. MAINTAINER Block

This block is mandatory. The variables are:

-   MAINTAINER

-   COMMENT

-   WWW

15.4. LICENSE Block

This block is optional, although it is highly recommended. The variables
are:

-   LICENSE

-   LICENSE_COMB

-   LICENSE_GROUPS or LICENSE_GROUPS_NAME

-   LICENSE_NAME or LICENSE_NAME_NAME

-   LICENSE_TEXT or LICENSE_TEXT_NAME

-   LICENSE_FILE or LICENSE_FILE_NAME

-   LICENSE_PERMS or LICENSE_PERMS_NAME_

-   LICENSE_DISTFILES or LICENSE_DISTFILES_NAME

If there are multiple licenses, sort the different LICENSE_VAR_NAME
variables by license name.

15.5. Generic BROKEN/IGNORE/DEPRECATED Messages

This block is optional. The variables are:

-   DEPRECATED

-   EXPIRATION_DATE

-   FORBIDDEN

-   BROKEN

-   BROKEN_*

-   IGNORE

-   IGNORE_*

-   ONLY_FOR_ARCHS

-   ONLY_FOR_ARCHS_REASON*

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | BROKEN_* and IGNORE_* can be any  |
|                                   | generic variables, for example,   |
|                                   | IGNORE_amd64, BROKEN_FreeBSD_10,  |
|                                   | etc. With the exception of        |
|                                   | variables that depend on a USES,  |
|                                   | place those in USES and USE_x.    |
|                                   | For instance, IGNORE_WITH_PHP     |
|                                   | only works if php is set, and     |
|                                   | BROKEN_SSL only if ssl is set.    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the port is marked BROKEN when |
|                                   | some conditions are met, and such |
|                                   | conditions can only be tested     |
|                                   | after including                   |
|                                   | bsd.port.options.mk or            |
|                                   | bsd.port.pre.mk, then those       |
|                                   | variables should be set later, in |
|                                   | The Rest of the Variables.        |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

15.6. The Dependencies Block

This block is optional. The variables are:

-   FETCH_DEPENDS

-   EXTRACT_DEPENDS

-   PATCH_DEPENDS

-   BUILD_DEPENDS

-   LIB_DEPENDS

-   RUN_DEPENDS

-   TEST_DEPENDS

15.7. Flavors

This block is optional.

Start this section with defining FLAVORS. Continue with the possible

.if ${FLAVOR:U} == foo should go in their respective sections below.

15.8. USES and USE_x

Start this section with defining USES, and then possible USE_x.

Keep related variables close together. For example, if using USE_GITHUB,
always put the GH_* variables right after it.

15.9. Standard bsd.port.mk Variables

This section block is for variables that can be defined in bsd.port.mk
that do not belong in any of the previous section blocks.

Order is not important, however try to keep similar variables together.
For example uid and gid variables USERS and GROUPS. Configuration
variables CONFIGURE_* and *_CONFIGURE. List of files, and directories
PORTDOCS and PORTEXAMPLES.

15.10. Options and Helpers

If the port uses the options framework, define OPTIONS_DEFINE and
OPTIONS_DEFAULT first, then the other OPTIONS_* variables first, then
the *_DESC descriptions, then the options helpers. Try and sort all of
those alphabetically.

Example 115. Options Variables Order Example

The FOO and BAR options do not have a standard description, so one need
to be written. The other options already have one in
Mk/bsd.options.desc.mk so writing one is not needed. The DOCS and
EXAMPLES use target helpers to install their files, they are shown here
for completeness, though they belong in The Targets, so other variables
and targets could be inserted before them.

    OPTIONS_DEFINE=   DOCS EXAMPLES FOO BAR
    OPTIONS_DEFAULT=    FOO
    OPTIONS_RADIO=  SSL
    OPTIONS_RADIO_SSL=    OPENSSL GNUTLS
    OPTIONS_SUB=    yes

    BAR_DESC=       Enable bar support
    FOO_DESC=       Enable foo support

    BAR_CONFIGURE_WITH= bar=${LOCALBASE}
    FOO_CONFIGURE_ENABLE=   foo
    GNUTLS_CONFIGURE_ON=    --with-ssl=gnutls
    OPENSSL_CONFIGURE_ON=   --with-ssl=openssl

    post-install-DOCS-on:
          ${MKDIR} ${STAGEDIR}${DOCSDIR}
          cd ${WRKSRC}/doc && ${COPYTREE_SHARE} . ${STAGEDIR}${DOCSDIR}

    post-install-EXAMPLES-on:
          ${MKDIR} ${STAGEDIR}${EXAMPLESDIR}
          cd ${WRKSRC}/ex && ${COPYTREE_SHARE} . ${STAGEDIR}${EXAMPLESDIR}

15.11. The Rest of the Variables

And then, the rest of the variables that are not mentioned in the
previous blocks.

15.12. The Targets

After all the variables are defined, the optional make(1) targets can be
defined. Keep pre- before post- and in the same order as the different
stages run:

-   fetch

-   extract

-   patch

-   configure

-   build

-   install

-   test

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Chapter 16. Keeping Up

The FreeBSD Ports Collection is constantly changing. Here is some
information on how to keep up.

16.1. FreshPorts

One of the easiest ways to learn about updates that have already been
committed is by subscribing to FreshPorts. Multiple ports can be
monitored. Maintainers are strongly encouraged to subscribe, because
they will receive notification of not only their own changes, but also
any changes that any other FreeBSD committer has made. (These are often
necessary to keep up with changes in the underlying ports
framework-although it would be most polite to receive an advance
heads-up from those committing such changes, sometimes this is
overlooked or impractical. Also, in some cases, the changes are very
minor in nature. We expect everyone to use their best judgement in these
cases.)

To use FreshPorts, an account is required. Those with registered email
addresses at @FreeBSD.org will see the opt-in link on the right-hand
side of the web pages. Those who already have a FreshPorts account but
are not using a @FreeBSD.org email address can change the email to
@FreeBSD.org, subscribe, then change it back again.

FreshPorts also has a sanity test feature which automatically tests each
commit to the FreeBSD ports tree. If subscribed to this service, a
committer will receive notifications of any errors which FreshPorts
detects during sanity testing of their commits.

16.2. The Web Interface to the Source Repository

It is possible to browse the files in the source repository by using a
web interface. Changes that affect the entire port system are now
documented in the CHANGES file. Changes that affect individual ports are
now documented in the UPDATING file. However, the definitive answer to
any question is undoubtedly to read the source code of bsd.port.mk, and
associated files.

16.3. The FreeBSD Ports Mailing List

As a ports maintainer, consider subscribing to FreeBSD ports mailing
list. Important changes to the way ports work will be announced there,
and then committed to CHANGES.

If the volume of messages on this mailing list is too high, consider
following FreeBSD ports announce mailing list which contains only
announcements.

16.4. The FreeBSD Port Building Cluster

One of the least-publicized strengths of FreeBSD is that an entire
cluster of machines is dedicated to continually building the Ports
Collection, for each of the major OS releases and for each Tier-1
architecture.

Individual ports are built unless they are specifically marked with
IGNORE. Ports that are marked with BROKEN will still be attempted, to
see if the underlying problem has been resolved. (This is done by
passing TRYBROKEN to the port’s Makefile.)

16.5. Portscout: the FreeBSD Ports Distfile Scanner

The build cluster is dedicated to building the latest release of each
port with distfiles that have already been fetched. However, as the
Internet continually changes, distfiles can quickly go missing.
Portscout, the FreeBSD Ports distfile scanner, attempts to query every
download site for every port to find out if each distfile is still
available. Portscout can generate HTML reports and send emails about
newly available ports to those who request them. Unless not otherwise
subscribed, maintainers are asked to check periodically for changes,
either by hand or using the RSS feed.

Portscout’s first page gives the email address of the port maintainer,
the number of ports the maintainer is responsible for, the number of
those ports with new distfiles, and the percentage of those ports that
are out-of-date. The search function allows for searching by email
address for a specific maintainer, and for selecting whether only
out-of-date ports are shown.

Upon clicking on a maintainer’s email address, a list of all of their
ports is displayed, along with port category, current version number,
whether or not there is a new version, when the port was last updated,
and finally when it was last checked. A search function on this page
allows the user to search for a specific port.

Clicking on a port name in the list displays the FreshPorts port
information.

Additional documentation is available in the Portscout repository.

Chapter 17. Using USES Macros

17.1. An Introduction to USES

USES macros make it easy to declare requirements and settings for a
port. They can add dependencies, change building behavior, add metadata
to packages, and so on, all by selecting simple, preset values.

Each section in this chapter describes a possible value for USES, along
with its possible arguments. Arguments are appended to the value after a
colon (:). Multiple arguments are separated by commas (,).

Example 116. Using Multiple Values

    USES=  bison perl

Example 117. Adding an Argument

    USES=   tar:xz

Example 118. Adding Multiple Arguments

    USES=    drupal:7,theme

Example 119. Mixing it All Together

    USES=   pgsql:9.3+ cpe python:2.7,build

17.2. 7z

Possible arguments: (none), p7zip, partial

Extract using 7z(1) instead of bsdtar(1) and sets EXTRACT_SUFX=.7z. The
p7zip option forces a dependency on the 7z from archivers/p7zip if the
one from the base system is not able to extract the files. EXTRACT_SUFX
is not changed if the partial option is used, this can be used if the
main distribution file does not have a .7z extension.

17.3. ada

Possible arguments: (none), 5, 6

Depends on an Ada-capable compiler, and sets CC accordingly. Defaults to
use gcc 5 from ports. Use the :_X_ version option to force building with
a different version.

17.4. autoreconf

Possible arguments: (none), build

Runs autoreconf. It encapsulates the aclocal, autoconf, autoheader,
automake, autopoint, and libtoolize commands. Each command applies to
${AUTORECONF_WRKSRC}/configure.ac or its old name,
${AUTORECONF_WRKSRC}/configure.in. If configure.ac defines
subdirectories with their own configure.ac using AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS,
autoreconf will recursively update those as well. The :build argument
only adds build time dependencies on those tools but does not run
autoreconf. A port can set AUTORECONF_WRKSRC if WRKSRC does not contain
the path to configure.ac.

17.5. blaslapack

Possible arguments: (none), atlas, netlib (default), gotoblas, openblas

Adds dependencies on Blas / Lapack libraries.

17.6. bdb

Possible arguments: (none), 48, 5 (default), 6

Add dependency on the Berkeley DB library. Default to databases/db5. It
can also depend on databases/db48 when using the :48 argument or
databases/db6 with :6. It is possible to declare a range of acceptable
values, :48+ finds the highest installed version, and falls back to 4.8
if nothing else is installed. INVALID_BDB_VER can be used to specify
versions which do not work with this port. The framework exposes the
following variables to the port:

BDB_LIB_NAME

    The name of the Berkeley DB library. For example, when using
    databases/db5, it contains db-5.3.

BDB_LIB_CXX_NAME

    The name of the Berkeley DBC++ library. For example, when using
    databases/db5, it contains db_cxx-5.3.

BDB_INCLUDE_DIR

    The location of the Berkeley DB include directory. For example, when
    using databases/db5, it will contain ${LOCALBASE}/include/db5.

BDB_LIB_DIR

    The location of the Berkeley DB library directory. For example, when
    using databases/db5, it contains ${LOCALBASE}/lib.

BDB_VER

    The detected Berkeley DB version. For example, if using USES=bdb:48+
    and Berkeley DB 5 is installed, it contains 5.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | databases/db48 is deprecated and  |
|                                   | unsupported. It must not be used  |
|                                   | by any port.                      |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

17.7. bison

Possible arguments: (none), build, run, both

Uses devel/bison By default, with no arguments or with the build
argument, it implies bison is a build-time dependency, run implies a
run-time dependency, and both implies both run-time and build-time
dependencies.

17.8. budgie

Possible arguments: (none)

Provide support for the Budgie desktop environment. Use USE_BUDGIE to
select the components needed for the port. See Using Budgie for more
information.

17.9. cabal

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Ports should not be created for   |
|                                   | Haskell libraries, see Haskell    |
|                                   | Libraries for more information.   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Possible arguments: (none), hpack, nodefault

Sets default values and targets used to build Haskell software using
Cabal. A build dependency on the Haskell compiler port (lang/ghc) is
added. If there is some other version of GHC already listed in the
BUILD_DEPENDS variable (for example, lang/ghc810), it would be used
instead. If the hpack argument is given, a build dependency on
devel/hs-hpack is added and hpack is invoked at configuration step to
generate .cabal file. If the nodefault argument is given, the framework
will not try to pull the main distribution file from the Hackage. This
argument is implicitly added if USE_GITHUB or USE_GITLAB is present.

The framework provides the following variables:

CABAL_REVISION

    Haskell packages hosted on Hackage may have revisions. Set this knob
    to an integer number to pull in revised package description.

USE_CABAL

    If the software uses Haskell dependencies, list them in this
    variable. Each item should be present on Hackage and be listed in
    form packagename-0.1.2. Dependencies can have revisions too, which
    are specified after the _ symbol. Automatic generation of the
    dependency list is supported, see Building Haskell Applications with
    cabal.

CABAL_FLAGS

    List of flags to be passed to cabal-install during the configuring
    and building stage. The flags are passed verbatim. This variable is
    usually used to enable or disable flags that are declared in the
    .cabal file. Pass foo to enable the foo flag and -foo to disable it.

CABAL_EXECUTABLES

    List of executable files installed by the port. Default value:
    ${PORTNAME}. Consult the .cabal file of the project being ported to
    get a list of possible values for this variable. Each value
    corresponds to an executable stanza in the .cabal file. Items from
    this list are automatically added to pkg-plist.

SKIP_CABAL_PLIST

    If defined, do not add items from ${CABAL_EXECUTABLES} to pkg-plist.

opt_USE_CABAL

    Adds items to ${USE_CABAL} depending on opt option.

opt_CABAL_EXECUTABLES

    Adds items to ${CABAL_EXECUTABLES} depending on opt option.

opt_CABAL_FLAGS

    If opt is enabled, append the value to ${CABAL_FLAGS}. Otherwise,
    append -value to disable the flag. Note that this behavior is
    slightly different from the plain CABAL_FLAGS as it does not accept
    values starting with -.

CABAL_WRAPPER_SCRIPTS

    A subset of ${CABAL_EXECUTABLES} containing Haskell programs to be
    wrapped into a shell script that sets *_datadir environment
    variables before running the program. This also causes the actual
    Haskell binary to be installed under libexec/cabal/ directory. This
    knob is needed for Haskell programs that install their data files
    under share/ directory.

FOO_DATADIR_VARS

    List of extra Haskell packages, whose data files should be
    accessible by the executable named FOO. The executable should be a
    part of ${CABAL_WRAPPER_SCRIPTS}. Haskell packages listed there
    should not have a version suffix.

CABAL_PROJECT

    Some Haskell projects may already have a cabal.project file, which
    is also generated by the ports framework. If that is the case, use
    this variable to specify what to do with the original cabal.project.
    Setting this variable to remove will cause the original file to be
    removed. Setting this variable to append will:

    1.  Move the original file to cabal.project.${PORTNAME} during the
        extract stage.

    2.  Concatenate the original cabal.project.${PORTNAME} and the
        generated cabal.project into a single file after the patch
        stage. Using append makes it possible to perform patching on the
        original file before it gets merged.

17.10. cargo

Possible arguments: (none)

Uses Cargo for configuring, building, and testing. It can be used to
port Rust applications that use the Cargo build system. For more
information see Building Rust Applications with cargo.

17.11. charsetfix

Possible arguments: (none)

Prevents the port from installing charset.alias. This must be installed
only by converters/libiconv. CHARSETFIX_MAKEFILEIN can be set to a path
relative to WRKSRC if charset.alias is not installed by
${WRKSRC}/Makefile.in.

17.12. cmake

Possible arguments: (none), insource, noninja, run, testing

Use CMake for configuring the port and generating a build system.

By default an out-of-source build is performed, leaving the sources in
WRKSRC free from build artifacts. With the insource argument, an
in-source build will be performed instead. This argument should be an
exception, used only when a regular out-of-source build does not work.

By default Ninja (devel/ninja) is used for the build. In some cases this
does not work correctly. With the noninja argument, the build will use
regular make for builds. This argument should only be used if a
Ninja-based build does not work.

With the run argument, a run dependency is registered in addition to a
build dependency.

With the testing argument, a test-target is added that uses CTest. When
running tests the port will be re-configured for testing and re-built.

For more information see Using cmake.

17.13. compiler

Possible arguments: (none), env (default, implicit), C++17-lang,
C++14-lang, C++11-lang, gcc-C++11-lib, C++11-lib, C++0x, c11, nestedfct,
features

Determines which compiler to use based on any given wishes. Use
C++17-lang if the port needs a C++17-capable compiler, C++14-lang if the
port needs a C++14-capable compiler, C++11-lang if the port needs a
C++11-capable compiler, gcc-C++11-lib if the port needs the g++ compiler
with a C++11 library, or C++11-lib if the port needs a C++11-ready
standard library. If the port needs a compiler understanding C++0X, C11
or nested functions, the corresponding parameters should be used.

Use features to request a list of features supported by the default
compiler. After including bsd.port.pre.mk the port can inspect the
results using these variables:

-   COMPILER_TYPE: the default compiler on the system, either gcc or
    clang

-   ALT_COMPILER_TYPE: the alternative compiler on the system, either
    gcc or clang. Only set if two compilers are present in the base
    system.

-   COMPILER_VERSION: the first two digits of the version of the default
    compiler.

-   ALT_COMPILER_VERSION: the first two digits of the version of the
    alternative compiler, if present.

-   CHOSEN_COMPILER_TYPE: the chosen compiler, either gcc or clang

-   COMPILER_FEATURES: the features supported by the default compiler.
    It currently lists the C++ library.

17.14. cpe

Possible arguments: (none)

Include Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) information in package
manifest as a CPE 2.3 formatted string. See the CPE specification for
details. To add CPE information to a port, follow these steps:

1.  Search for the official CPE entry for the software product either by
    using the NVD’s CPE search engine or in the official CPE dictionary
    (warning, very large XML file). Do not ever make up CPE data.

2.  Add cpe to USES and compare the result of make -V CPE_STR to the CPE
    dictionary entry. Continue one step at a time until make -V CPE_STR
    is correct.

3.  If the product name (second field, defaults to PORTNAME) is
    incorrect, define CPE_PRODUCT.

4.  If the vendor name (first field, defaults to CPE_PRODUCT) is
    incorrect, define CPE_VENDOR.

5.  If the version field (third field, defaults to PORTVERSION) is
    incorrect, define CPE_VERSION.

6.  If the update field (fourth field, defaults to empty) is incorrect,
    define CPE_UPDATE.

7.  If it is still not correct, check Mk/Uses/cpe.mk for additional
    details, or contact the Ports Security Team
    <ports-secteam@FreeBSD.org>.

8.  Derive as much as possible of the CPE name from existing variables
    such as PORTNAME and PORTVERSION. Use variable modifiers to extract
    the relevant portions from these variables rather than hardcoding
    the name.

9.  Always run make -V CPE_STR and check the output before committing
    anything that changes PORTNAME or PORTVERSION or any other variable
    which is used to derive CPE_STR.

17.15. cran

Possible arguments: (none), auto-plist, compiles

Uses the Comprehensive R Archive Network. Specify auto-plist to
automatically generate pkg-plist. Specify compiles if the port has code
that need to be compiled.

17.16. desktop-file-utils

Possible arguments: (none)

Uses update-desktop-database from devel/desktop-file-utils. An extra
post-install step will be run without interfering with any post-install
steps already in the port Makefile. A line with @desktop-file-utils will
be added to the plist.

17.17. desthack

Possible arguments: (none)

Changes the behavior of GNU configure to properly support DESTDIR in
case the original software does not.

17.18. display

Possible arguments: (none), ARGS

Set up a virtual display environment. If the environment variable
DISPLAY is not set, then Xvfb is added as a build dependency, and
CONFIGURE_ENV is extended with the port number of the currently running
instance of Xvfb. The ARGS parameter defaults to install and controls
the phase around which to start and stop the virtual display.

17.19. dos2unix

Possible arguments: (none)

The port has files with line endings in DOS format which need to be
converted. Several variables can be set to control which files will be
converted. The default is to convert all files, including binaries. See
Simple Automatic Replacements for examples.

-   DOS2UNIX_REGEX: match file names based on a regular expression.

-   DOS2UNIX_FILES: match literal file names.

-   DOS2UNIX_GLOB: match file names based on a glob pattern.

-   DOS2UNIX_WRKSRC: the directory from which to start the conversions.
    Defaults to ${WRKSRC}.

17.20. drupal

Possible arguments: 7, module, theme

Automate installation of a port that is a Drupal theme or module. Use
with the version of Drupal that the port is expecting. For example,
USES=drupal:7,module says that this port creates a Drupal 7 module. A
Drupal 7 theme can be specified with USES=drupal:7,theme.

17.21. eigen

Possible arguments: 2, 3, build (default), run

Add dependency on math/eigen.

17.22. elfctl

Possible arguments: (none)

Change an ELF binary’s feature control note by setting ELF_FEATURES.

Example 120. Uses=elfctl

    USES=           elfctl
    ELF_FEATURES=   featurelist:path/to/file1 \
            featurelist:path/to/file1 \
            featurelist:path/to/file2

The format of featurelist is described in elfctl(1). The file paths are
relative to ${BUILD_WRKSRC}.

17.23. erlang

Possible arguments: (none), enc, rebar, rebar3

Adds a build and run time dependency on lang/erlang. Depending on the
argument, it adds additional build dependencies. enc adds a dependency
on devel/erlang-native-compiler, rebar adds a dependency on devel/rebar
and rebar3 adds a dependency on devel/rebar3.

In addition, the following variables are available to the port:

-   ERL_APP_NAME: Erlang app name as installed in Erlang’s lib dir
    (minus version)

-   ERL_APP_ROOT: Root directory for this Erlang app

-   REBAR_CMD: Path to the "rebar" command

-   REBAR3_CMD: Path to the "rebar3" command

-   REBAR_PROFILE: Rebar profile

-   REBAR_TARGETS: Rebar target list (usually compile, maybe escriptize)

-   ERL_BUILD_NAME: Build name for rebar3

-   ERL_BUILD_DEPS: List of BUILD_DEPENDS in category/portname format

-   ERL_RUN_DEPS: List of RUN_DEPENDS in category/portname format

-   ERL_DOCS: List of documentation files and directories

17.24. fakeroot

Possible arguments: (none)

Changes some default behavior of build systems to allow installing as a
user. See https://wiki.debian.org/FakeRoot for more information on
fakeroot.

17.25. fam

Possible arguments: (none), fam, gamin

Uses a File Alteration Monitor as a library dependency, either devel/fam
or devel/gamin. End users can set WITH_FAM_SYSTEM to specify their
preference.

17.26. firebird

Possible arguments: (none), 25

Add a dependency to the client library of the Firebird database.

17.27. fonts

Possible arguments: (none), fc, fontsdir (default), none

Adds a runtime dependency on tools needed to register fonts. Depending
on the argument, add a @fc ${FONTSDIR} line, @fontsdir ${FONTSDIR} line,
or no line if the argument is none, to the plist. FONTSDIR defaults to

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Possible arguments: (none), N.NN, N.NN-devel, modules, no_targets, run

Sets default values and targets used to build Go software. A build
dependency on the Go compiler port is added, port maintainers can set
version required. By default the build is performed in GOPATH mode. If
Go software uses modules, the modules-aware mode can be switched on with
modules argument. no_targets will setup build environment like GO_ENV,
GO_BUILDFLAGS but skip creating extract and build targets. run will also
add a run dependency on the Go compiler port.

The build process is controlled by several variables:

GO_MODULE

    The name of the application module as specified by the module
    directive in go.mod. In most cases, this is the only required
    variable for ports that use Go modules.

GO_PKGNAME

    The name of the Go package when building in GOPATH mode. This is the
    directory that will be created in ${GOPATH}/src. If not set
    explicitly and GH_SUBDIR or GL_SUBDIR is present, GO_PKGNAME will be
    inferred from it. It is not needed when building in modules-aware
    mode.

GO_TARGET

    The packages to build. The default value is ${GO_PKGNAME}. GO_TARGET
    can also be a tuple in the form package:path where path can be
    either a simple filename or a full path starting with ${PREFIX}.

GO_TESTTARGET

    The packages to test. The default value is ./…​ (the current package
    and all subpackages).

CGO_CFLAGS

    Additional CFLAGS values to be passed to the C compiler by go.

CGO_LDFLAGS

    Additional LDFLAGS values to be passed to the C compiler by go.

GO_BUILDFLAGS

    Additional build arguments to be passed to go build.

GO_TESTFLAGS

    Additional build arguments to be passed to go test.

See Building Go Applications for usage examples.

17.39. gperf

Possible arguments: (none)

Add a buildtime dependency on devel/gperf if gperf is not present in the
base system.

17.40. grantlee

Possible arguments: 5, selfbuild

Handle dependency on Grantlee. Specify 5 to depend on the Qt5 based
version, devel/grantlee5. selfbuild is used internally by
devel/grantlee5 to get their versions numbers.

17.41. groff

Possible arguments: build, run, both

Registers a dependency on textproc/groff if not present in the base
system.

17.42. gssapi

Possible arguments: (none), base (default), heimdal, mit, flags,
bootstrap

Handle dependencies needed by consumers of the GSS-API. Only libraries
that provide the Kerberos mechanism are available. By default, or set to
base, the GSS-API library from the base system is used. Can also be set
to heimdal to use security/heimdal, or mit to use security/krb5.

When the local Kerberos installation is not in LOCALBASE, set
HEIMDAL_HOME (for heimdal) or KRB5_HOME (for krb5) to the location of
the Kerberos installation.

These variables are exported for the ports to use:

-   GSSAPIBASEDIR

-   GSSAPICPPFLAGS

-   GSSAPIINCDIR

-   GSSAPILDFLAGS

-   GSSAPILIBDIR

-   GSSAPILIBS

-   GSSAPI_CONFIGURE_ARGS

The flags option can be given alongside base, heimdal, or mit to
automatically add GSSAPICPPFLAGS, GSSAPILDFLAGS, and GSSAPILIBS to
CFLAGS, LDFLAGS, and LDADD, respectively. For example, use base,flags.

The bootstrap option is a special prefix only for use by security/krb5
and security/heimdal. For example, use bootstrap,mit.

Example 121. Typical Use

    OPTIONS_SINGLE= GSSAPI
    OPTIONS_SINGLE_GSSAPI=  GSSAPI_BASE GSSAPI_HEIMDAL GSSAPI_MIT GSSAPI_NONE

17.44. horde

Possible arguments: (none)

Add buildtime and runtime dependencies on devel/pear-channel-horde.
Other Horde dependencies can be added with USE_HORDE_BUILD and
USE_HORDE_RUN. See Horde Modules for more information.

17.45. iconv

Possible arguments: (none), lib, build, patch, translit, wchar_t

Uses iconv functions, either from the port converters/libiconv as a
build-time and run-time dependency, or from the base system. By default,
with no arguments or with the lib argument, implies iconv with
build-time and run-time dependencies. build implies a build-time
dependency, and patch implies a patch-time dependency. If the port uses
the WCHAR_T or //TRANSLIT iconv extensions, add the relevant arguments
so that the correct iconv is used. For more information see Using iconv.

17.46. imake

Possible arguments: (none), env, notall, noman

Add devel/imake as a build-time dependency and run xmkmf -a during the
configure stage. If the env argument is given, the configure target is
not set. If the -a flag is a problem for the port, add the notall
argument. If xmkmf does not generate a install.man target, add the noman
argument.

17.47. kde

Possible arguments: 5

Add dependency on KDE components. See Using KDE for more information.

17.48. kmod

Possible arguments: (none), debug

Fills in the boilerplate for kernel module ports, currently:

-   Add kld to CATEGORIES.

-   Set SSP_UNSAFE.

-   Set IGNORE if the kernel sources are not found in SRC_BASE.

-   Define KMODDIR to /boot/modules by default, add it to PLIST_SUB and
    MAKE_ENV, and create it upon installation. If KMODDIR is set to
    /boot/kernel, it will be rewritten to /boot/modules. This prevents
    breaking packages when upgrading the kernel due to /boot/kernel
    being renamed to /boot/kernel.old in the process.

-   Handle cross-referencing kernel modules upon installation and
    deinstallation, using @kld.

-   If the debug argument is given, the port can install a debug version
    of the module into KERN_DEBUGDIR/KMODDIR. By default, KERN_DEBUGDIR
    is copied from DEBUGDIR and set to /usr/lib/debug. The framework
    will take care of creating and removing any required directories.

17.49. ldap

Possible arguments: (none), <version>, client, server

Registers a dependency on net/openldap. It uses the specific <version>
(without the dot notation) if set. Otherwise it tries to find the
currently installed version. If necessary it falls back to the default
version found in bsd.default-versions.mk. client specifies a runtime
dependency on the client library. This is also the default. server
specifies a runtime dependency on the server.

The following variables can be accessed by the port:

IGNORE_WITH_OPENLDAP

    This variable can be defined if the ports does not support one or
    more versions of OpenLDAP.

WITH_OPENLDAP_VER

    User defined variable to set OpenLDAP version.

OPENLDAP_VER

    Detected OpenLDAP version.

17.50. lha

Possible arguments: (none)

must include USES=libedit.

17.53. libtool

Possible arguments: (none), keepla, build

Patches libtool scripts. This must be added to all ports that use
libtool. The keepla argument can be used to keep .la files. Some ports
do not ship with their own copy of libtool and need a build time
dependency on devel/libtool, use the :build argument to add such
dependency.

17.54. linux

Possible arguments: c6, c7

Ports Linux compatibility framework. Specify c6 to depend on CentOS 6
packags. Specify c7 to depend on CentOS 7 packages. The available

17.55. llvm

Possible arguments: (none), XY, min=XY, max=XY, build, run, lib

Adds a dependency on LLVM. By default this is a build dependency unless
overridden by the run or lib options. The default version is the one set
in LLVM_DEFAULT. A specific version can be specified as well. The
minimum and maximum versions can be specified with the min and max
parameters respectively. The ports framework export the following
variables to the port:

LLVM_VERSION

    Version chosen from the arguments to llvm.mk

LLVM_PORT

    Chosen llvm port

LLVM_CONFIG

    llvm-config of the chosen port

LLVM_LIBLLVM

    libLLVM.so of the chosen port

    Installation prefix of the chosen port

17.56. localbase

Possible arguments: (none), ldflags

Ensures that libraries from dependencies in LOCALBASE are used instead
of the ones from the base system. Specify ldflags to add
-L${LOCALBASE}/lib to LDFLAGS instead of LIBS. Ports that depend on
libraries that are also present in the base system should use this. It
is also used internally by a few other USES.

17.57. lua

Possible arguments: (none), XY, XY+, -XY, XY-ZA, module, flavors, build,
run, env

Adds a dependency on Lua. By default this is a library dependency,
unless overridden by the build and/or run option. The env option
prevents the addition of any dependency, while still defining all the
usual variables.

The default version is set by the usual DEFAULT_VERSIONS mechanism,
unless a version or range of versions is specified as an argument, for
example, 51 or 51-54.

Applications using Lua are normally built for only a single Lua version.
However, library modules intended to be loaded by Lua code should use
the module option to build with multiple flavors.

For more information see Using Lua.

17.58. luajit

Possible arguments: (none), X

Adds a dependency on luajit runtime. A specific version X can be used.
Possible versions are luajit, luajit-devel, luajit-openresty

Adds a library dependency on archivers/minizip or archivers/minizip-ng
respectively.

17.67. mysql

Possible arguments: (none), version, client (default), server, embedded

Provide support for MySQL If no version is given, try to find the
current installed version. Fall back to the default version, MySQL-5.6.
The possible versions are 55, 55m, 55p, 56, 56p, 56w, 57, 57p, 80, 100m,
101m, and 102m. The m and p suffixes are for the MariaDB and Percona
variants of MySQL. server and embedded add a build- and run-time
dependency on the MySQL server. When using server or embedded, add
client to also add a dependency on libmysqlclient.so. A port can set
IGNORE_WITH_MYSQL if some versions are not supported.

The framework sets MYSQL_VER to the detected MySQL version.

17.68. mono

Possible arguments: (none), nuget

Adds a dependency on the Mono (currently only C#) framework by setting
the appropriate dependencies.

Specify nuget when the port uses nuget packages. NUGET_DEPENDS needs to
be set with the names and versions of the nuget packages in the format
name=version. An optional package origin can be added using
name=version:_origin_.

The helper target, buildnuget, will output the content of the
NUGET_DEPENDS based on the provided packages.config.

17.69. motif

Possible arguments: (none)

Uses x11-toolkits/open-motif as a library dependency. End users can set
WANT_LESSTIF in make.conf to use x11-toolkits/lesstif as dependency
instead of x11-toolkits/open-motif. Similarly setting
WANT_OPEN_MOTIF_DEVEL in make.conf will add a dependency on
x11-toolkits/open-motif-devel

17.70. ncurses

Possible arguments: (none), base, port

Uses ncurses, and causes some useful variables to be set.

17.71. nextcloud

Possible arguments: (none)

Adds support for Nextcloud applications by adding a run time dependency
on www/nextcloud.

17.72. ninja

Possible arguments: (none), build, make (default), run

If build or run arguments are specify, it respectively adds a build or
run time dependency on devel/ninja. If make or no arguments are
provided, use ninja to build the port instead of make. make implies
build. If the variable NINJA_DEFAULT is set to samurai, then the
depedencies are set on devel/samurai instead.

17.73. nodejs

Possible arguments: (none), build, run, current, lts, 10, 14, 16, 17.

Uses nodejs. Adds a dependency on www/node*. If a supported version is

Possible arguments: (none)

Look for Makefile.in and configure in PATHFIX_WRKSRC (defaults to
WRKSRC) and fix common paths to make sure they respect the FreeBSD
hierarchy. For example, it fixes the installation directory of
pkgconfig’s .pc files to ${PREFIX}/libdata/pkgconfig. If the port uses `USES=autoreconf,
Makefile.am will be added to PATHFIX_MAKEFILEIN automatically.

If the port USES=cmake it will look for CMakeLists.txt in
PATHFIX_WRKSRC. If needed, that default filename can be changed with
PATHFIX_CMAKELISTSTXT.

17.78. pear

Possible arguments: env

Adds a dependency on devel/pear. It will setup default behavior for
software using the PHP Extension and Application Repository. Using the
env arguments only sets up the PEAR environment variables. See PEAR
Modules for more information.

17.79. perl5

Possible arguments: (none)

Depends on Perl. The configuration is done using USE_PERL5.

USE_PERL5 can contain the phases in which to use Perl, can be extract,
patch, build, run, or test.

USE_PERL5 can also contain configure, modbuild, or modbuildtiny when
Makefile.PL, Build.PL, or Module::Build::Tiny’s flavor of Build.PL is
required.

USE_PERL5 defaults to build run. When using configure, modbuild, or
modbuildtiny, build and run are implied.

See Using Perl for more information.

17.80. pgsql

Possible arguments: (none), X.Y, X.Y+, X.Y-, X.Y-Z.A

Provide support for PostgreSQL. Port maintainer can set version
required. Minimum and maximum versions or a range can be specified; for
example, 9.0-, 8.4+, 8.4-9.2.

By default, the added dependency will be the client, but if the port
requires additional components, this can be done using
WANT_PGSQL=component[:target]; for example,
WANT_PGSQL=server:configure pltcl plperl. The available components are:

17.81. php

Possible arguments: (none), phpize, ext, zend, build, cli, cgi, mod,
web, embed, pecl, flavors, noflavors

Provide support for PHP. Add a runtime dependency on the default PHP
version, lang/php81.

phpize

    Use to build a PHP extension. Enables flavors.

ext

    Use to build, install and register a PHP extension. Enables flavors.

zend

    Use to build, install and register a Zend extension. Enables
    flavors.

build

    Set PHP also as a build-time dependency.

cli

    Needs the CLI version of PHP.

cgi

    Needs the CGI version of PHP.

mod

    Needs the Apache module for PHP.

web

    Needs the Apache module or the CGI version of PHP.

embed

    Needs the embedded library version of PHP.

pecl

    Provide defaults for fetching PHP extensions from the PECL
    repository. Enables flavors.

flavors

    Enable automatic PHP flavors generation. Flavors will be generated
    for all PHP versions, except the ones present in IGNORE_WITH_PHP.

noflavors

    Disable automatic PHP flavors generation. Must only be used with
    extensions provided by PHP itself.

Variables are used to specify which PHP modules are required, as well as
which version of PHP are supported.

USE_PHP

    The list of required PHP extensions at run-time. Add :build to the
    extension name to add a build-time dependency. Example:
    pcre xml:build gettext

IGNORE_WITH_PHP

    The port does not work with PHP of the given version. For possible
    values look at the content of _ALL_PHP_VERSIONS in Mk/Uses/php.mk.

When building a PHP or Zend extension with :ext or :zend, these
variables can be set:

PHP_MODNAME

    The name of the PHP or Zend extension. Default value is ${PORTNAME}.

PHP_HEADER_DIRS

    A list of subdirectories from which to install header files. The
    framework will always install the header files that are present in
    the same directory as the extension.

PHP_MOD_PRIO

    The priority at which to load the extension. It is a number between
    00 and 99.

    For extensions that do not depend on any extension, the priority is
    automatically set to 20, for extensions that depend on another
    extension, the priority is automatically set to 30. Some extensions
    may need to be loaded before every other extension, for example
    www/php56-opcache. Some may need to be loaded after an extension
    with a priority of 30. In that case, add PHP_MOD_PRIO=XX in the
    port’s Makefile. For example:

        USES=        php:ext
        USE_PHP=    wddx
        PHP_MOD_PRIO=   40

These variables are available to use in PKGNAMEPREFIX or PKGNAMESUFFIX:

PHP_PKGNAMEPREFIX

    Contains php_XY_- where XY is the current flavor’s PHP version. Use
    with PHP extensions and modules.

PHP_PKGNAMESUFFIX

    Contains -php_XY_ where XY is the current flavor’s PHP version. Use
    with PHP applications.

PECL_PKGNAMEPREFIX

    Contains php_XY_-pecl- where XY is the current flavor’s PHP version.
    Use with PECL modules.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

17.82. pkgconfig

Possible arguments: (none), build (default), run, both

Uses devel/pkgconf. With no arguments or with the build argument, it
implies pkg-config as a build-time dependency. run implies a run-time
dependency and both implies both run-time and build-time dependencies.

17.83. pure

Possible arguments: (none), ffi

Uses lang/pure. Largely used for building related pure ports. With the
ffi argument, it implies devel/pure-ffi as a run-time dependency.

17.84. pyqt

Possible arguments: (none), 4, 5

Uses PyQt. If the port is part of PyQT itself, set PYQT_DIST. Use
USE_PYQT to select the components the port needs. The available
components are:

-   core

-   dbus

-   dbussupport

-   demo

-   designer

-   designerplugin

-   doc

-   gui

-   multimedia

-   network

-   opengl

-   qscintilla2

-   sip

-   sql

-   svg

-   test

-   webkit

-   xml

-   xmlpatterns

These components are only available with PyQT4:

-   assistant

-   declarative

-   help

-   phonon

-   script

-   scripttools

These components are only available with PyQT5:

-   multimediawidgets

-   printsupport

-   qml

-   serialport

-   webkitwidgets

-   widgets

The default dependency for each component is build- and run-time, to
select only build or run, add _build or _run to the component name. For
example:

    USES=      pyqt
    USE_PYQT=   core doc_build designer_run

17.85. pytest

Possible arguments: (none), 4

Introduces a new dependency on devel/pytest. It defines a do-test target
which will run the tests properly. Use the argument to depend on a
specific devel/pytest version. For ports using devel/pytest consider
using this instead of a specific do-test target. The framework exposes
the following variables to the port:

PYTEST_ARGS

    Additional arguments to pytest (defaults to empty).

PYTEST_IGNORED_TESTS

    lists of pytest -k patterns of tests to ignore (defaults to empty).
    For tests which are not expected to pass, such as ones requiring a
    database access.

PYTEST_BROKEN_TESTS

    lists of pytest -k patterns of tests to ignore (defaults to empty).
    For broken tests which require fixing.

In addition the following variables may be set by the user:

PYTEST_ENABLE_IGNORED_TESTS

    Enable tests which are otherwise ignored by PYTEST_IGNORED_TESTS.

PYTEST_ENABLE_BROKEN_TESTS

    Enable tests which are otherwise ignored by PYTEST_BROKEN_TESTS.

PYTEST_ENABLE_ALL_TESTS

    Enable tests which are otherwise ignored by PYTEST_IGNORED_TESTS and
    PYTEST_BROKEN_TESTS.

17.86. python

Possible arguments: (none), X.Y, X.Y+, -X.Y, X.Y-Z.A, patch, build, run,
test

Uses Python. A supported version or version range can be specified. If
Python is only needed at build time, run time or for the tests, it can
be set as a build, run or test dependency with build, run, or test. If
Python is also needed during the patch phase, use patch. See Using
Python for more information.

PYTHON_NO_DEPENDS=yes can be used when the variables exported by the
framework are needed but a dependency on Python is not. It can happen
when using with USES=shebangfix, and the goal is only to fix the
shebangs but not add a dependency on Python.

17.87. qmail

Possible arguments: (none), build, run, both, vars

Uses mail/qmail. With the build argument, it implies qmail as a
build-time dependency. run implies a run-time dependency. Using no
argument or the both argument implies both run-time and build-time
dependencies. vars will only set QMAIL variables for the port to use.

17.88. qmake

Possible arguments: (none), norecursive, outsource, no_env, no_configure

Uses QMake for configuring. For more information see Using qmake.

17.89. qt

Possible arguments: 5, 6, no_env

Add dependency on Qt components. no_env is passed directly to
USES= qmake. See Using Qt for more information.

17.90. qt-dist

Possible arguments: (none) or 5 and (none) or 6 and (none) or one of 3d,
5compat, base, charts, connectivity, datavis3d, declarative, doc
languageserver, gamepad, graphicaleffects, imageformats, locat ion,
lottie, multimedia, networkauth, positioning, quick3d, quickcontrols2,
quickcontrols, quicktimeline, remoteobjects, script, scxml `, `sensors,
serialbus, serialport, shadertools, speech, svg, tools, translations,
virtualkeyboard, wayland, webchannel, webengine, webglplugin,
websockets, webview, x11extras, xmlpatterns.

Provides support for building Qt 5 and Qt 6 components. It takes care of
setting up the appropriate configuration environment for the port to
build.

Example 122. Building Qt 5 Components

The port is Qt 5’s networkauth component, which is part of the
networkauth distribution file.

    PORTNAME=    networkauth
    DISTVERSION=    ${QT5_VERSION}

    USES=       qt-dist:5

Example 123. Building Qt 6 Components

The port is Qt 6’s websockets component, which is part of the websockets
distribution file.

    PORTNAME=       websockets
    PORTVERSION=    ${QT6_VERSION}

    USES=           qt-dist:6

If PORTNAME does not match the component name, it can be passed as an
argument to qt-dist.

Example 124. Building Qt 5 Components with Different Names

The port is Qt 5’s gui component, which is part of the base distribution
file.

    PORTNAME=  gui
    DISTVERSION=    ${QT5_VERSION}

    USES=       qt-dist:5,base

17.91. readline

Possible arguments: (none), port

Uses readline as a library dependency, and sets CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS as
necessary. If the port argument is used or if readline is not present in
the base system, add a dependency on devel/readline

17.92. ruby

Possible arguments: (none), build, extconf, run, setup

Provide support for Ruby related ports. (none) without arguments adds
runtime dependency on lang/ruby. build adds a dependency on lang/ruby at
build time. extconf states that the port uses extconf.rb to configure.
run adds a dependency on lang/ruby at run time. This is also the
default. setup states that the port uses setup.rb to configure and
build.

The user may have the following variables defined:

RUBY_VER

    Alternative short version of ruby in the form of `x.y'.

RUBY_DEFAULT_VER

    Set to (e.g.) 2.7 to use ruby27 as the default version.

RUBY_ARCH

    Set the architecture name (e.g. i386-freebsd7).

The following variables are exported to be used by the port:

RUBY

    Set to full path of ruby. If set, the values of the following
    variables are automatically obtained from the ruby executable:
    RUBY_ARCH, RUBY_ARCHLIBDIR, RUBY_LIBDIR, RUBY_SITEARCHLIBDIR,
    RUBY_SITELIBDIR, RUBY_VER and RUBY_VERSION

RUBY_VER

    Set to the alternative short version of ruby in the form of `x.y'.

RUBY_EXTCONF

    Set to the alternative name of extconf.rb (default: extconf.rb).

RUBY_EXTCONF_SUBDIRS

    Set to list of subdirectories, if multiple modules are included.

RUBY_SETUP

    Set to the alternative name of setup.rb (default: setup.rb).

17.93. samba

Possible arguments: build, env, lib, run

Handle dependency on Samba. env will not add any dependency and only set
up the variables. build and run will add build-time and run-time
dependency on smbd. lib will add a dependency on libsmbclient.so. The
variables that are exported are:

SAMBAPORT

    The origin of the default Samba port.

SAMBAINCLUDES

    The location of the Samba header files.

SAMBALIBS

    The directory where the Samba shared libraries are available.

17.94. scons

Possible arguments: (none)

Provide support for the use of devel/scons. See Using scons for more
information.

17.95. shared-mime-info

Possible arguments: (none)

Uses update-mime-database from misc/shared-mime-info. This uses will
automatically add a post-install step in such a way that the port itself
still can specify there own post-install step if needed. It also add an
@shared-mime-info entry to the plist.

17.96. shebangfix

Possible arguments: (none)

A lot of software uses incorrect locations for script interpreters, most
notably /usr/bin/perl and /bin/bash. The shebangfix macro fixes shebang
lines in scripts listed in SHEBANG_REGEX, SHEBANG_GLOB, or
SHEBANG_FILES.

SHEBANG_REGEX

    Contains one extended regular expressions, and is used with the
    -iregex argument of find(1). See USES=shebangfix with SHEBANG_REGEX.

SHEBANG_GLOB

    Contains a list of patterns used with the -name argument of find(1).
    See USES=shebangfix with SHEBANG_GLOB.

SHEBANG_FILES

    Contains a list of files or sh(1) globs. The shebangfix macro is run
    from ${WRKSRC}, so SHEBANG_FILES can contain paths that are relative
    to ${WRKSRC}. It can also deal with absolute paths if files outside
    of ${WRKSRC} require patching. See USES=shebangfix with
    SHEBANG_FILES.

Currently Bash, Java, Ksh, Lua, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Tcl, and Tk are
supported by default.

There are three configuration variables:

SHEBANG_LANG

    The list of supported interpreters.

_interp__CMD

    The path to the command interpreter on FreeBSD. The default value is
    ${LOCALBASE}/bin/interp.

_interp__OLD_CMD

    The list of wrong invocations of interpreters. These are typically
    obsolete paths, or paths used on other operating systems that are
    incorrect on FreeBSD. They will be replaced by the correct path in
    _interp__CMD.

Example 125. Adding Another Interpreter to USES=shebangfix

To add another interpreter, set SHEBANG_LANG. For example:

    SHEBANG_LANG=    lua

Example 126. Specifying all the Paths When Adding an Interpreter to
USES=shebangfix

If it was not already defined, and there were no default values for
_interpOLD_CMD and _interpCMD the Ksh entry could be defined as:

    SHEBANG_LANG=  ksh
    ksh_OLD_CMD=    "/usr/bin/env ksh" /bin/ksh /usr/bin/ksh
    ksh_CMD=    ${LOCALBASE}/bin/ksh

Example 127. Adding a Strange Location for an Interpreter

Some software uses strange locations for an interpreter. For example, an
application might expect Python to be located in /opt/bin/python2.7. The
strange path to be replaced can be declared in the port Makefile:

    python_OLD_CMD= /opt/bin/python2.7

Example 128. USES=shebangfix with SHEBANG_REGEX

To fix all the files in ${WRKSRC}/scripts ending in .pl, .sh, or .cgi
do:

    USES=   shebangfix
    SHEBANG_REGEX=  ./scripts/.*\.(sh|pl|cgi)

85+ or 86+). To only request a non version specific wrapper, use
wrapper. A build- or run-time only dependency can be specified using
build or run. To build the port using the Tcl Extension Architecture,
use tea. After including bsd.port.pre.mk the port can inspect the
results using these variables:

in ${PREFIX}/share/misc.

17.102. tex

Possible arguments: (none)

Provide support for tex. Loads all the default variables for TEX related
ports and does not add any dependency on any ports.

Variables are used to specify which TEX modules are required.

USE_TEX

|                                   | Note that 2.2-STABLE sometimes    |
|                                   | identifies itself as              |
|                                   | "2.2.5-STABLE" after the          |
|                                   | 2.2.5-RELEASE. The pattern used   |
|                                   | to be year followed by the month, |
|                                   | but the community decided to      |
|                                   | change it to a more               |
|                                   | straightforward major/minor       |
|                                   | system starting from 2.2. This is |
|                                   | because the parallel development  |
|                                   | on several branches made it       |
|                                   | infeasible to classify the        |
|                                   | releases merely by their real     |
|                                   | release dates. Do not worry about |
|                                   | old -CURRENTs; they are listed    |
