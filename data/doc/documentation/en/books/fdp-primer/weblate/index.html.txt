10.1. Introduction

This chapter describes some basic steps for joining the FreeBSD
translators team, translating online on Weblate or offline, and some
simple suggestions on translating, proofreading, and testing. Itâ€™s
focused on the translation part.

The original documents (articles and books) are in the documentation
portal.

Weblate is web-based open-source software focused on localization; the
FreeBSD project runs a local instance.

10.2. How to Become a FreeBSD Translator

Following are simple steps to start translating articles and books of
the FreeBSD Documentation Project.

1.  Create an account on the FreeBSD Weblate instance with an email
    address or your GitHub account.

2.  Subscribe to the FreeBSD translators mailing list.

3.  Introduce yourself and ask to join a language team. If the language
    team does not exist, ask to create it. The self-introduction is
    essential. It raises your chances of being approved for write
    access.

4.  Login to Weblate with the new account.

5.  Find the language team and choose an initial document to translate.

6.  Create a Bugzilla account to submit the translations after finishing
    a document. The Documentation project is also accepting GitHub Pull
    Requests with translation submissions.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | All translation files and         |
|                                   | documents must follow The FreeBSD |
|                                   | Documentation License; if this is |
|                                   | unacceptable, please do not sign  |
|                                   | up or send any patches or         |
|                                   | translations.                     |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

10.3. Introduce Yourself

Please provide a brief self-introduction on the FreeBSD translators
mailing list to initiate the process of granting access. This will
enable a language coordinator or administrator to provide the necessary
permissions for the new user of Weblate to start translating.

Following is an example of how such an email could look.

    Subject: Self-Introduction: Name and language

    Name:      Name (use preferred name)
    Location:  City, country (optional)
    Login:     username or email (essential)
    Language:  Language to translate (essential)
    Profession or student status: (optional)
    About You: (free format -- info which you feel comfortable sharing with
      others: company, school, other affiliation, historical qualifications, other
      projects you have worked on, level and type of computer skills, other relevant skills,
      etc.)
    You and the FreeBSD Project: (free format: other FreeBSD projects of
      interest, comments, etc.)

10.4. Login to Weblate

Open https://translate-dev.freebsd.org/ and Sign in.

[Weblate Login]

Use a username, email address, or GitHub account to log in.

The user profile contains your preferences, name, and email address. The
name and address will be used in commits; keep this information
accurate.

On the FreeBSD Weblate instance, all translations will be committed to
freebsd-doc-translate (an intermediate repository on GitHub), not
directly to freebsd-doc. Translators must take the PO gettext files
(.po), converting them to .adoc and submit it via Bugzilla or GitHub to
get the translated document published or updated in the documentation
portal. See more in the following sections.

Weblate will commit daily, at least to freebsd-doc-translate, if any new
strings are translated.

10.5. Find a Language Team to Join In

Click Projects, choose Documentation, then click Languages, and see all
the available languages.

[Weblate Languages]

Note that some languages and translated documents already exist in the
documentation portal and repositories.

If the desired language for translation is not available in Weblate,
please contact the language coordinators before asking to create a new
language. If there is no answer, then write to the Documentation
Engineering Team <doceng@FreeBSD.org>.

10.6. Translating Online on Weblate

Translating documents online proves to be the easiest method for
document translation on FreeBSD, as it allows users to collaborate on
the same file, distributing the workload.

Once a coordinator or administrator grants access to a specific language
for a username, the save button will be enabled, so that this user can
start translating.

[Weblate Documents]

[Weblate Translate]

Weblate has a set of links that lead to actual translation. The
translation is further divided into individual checks, like Untranslated
or Needing review. If the whole document is translated without any
error, All translations link is still available in case a review is
necessary. Alternatively, the search field can be used to find a
specific string or term.

In the Weblate documentation, there is more info about translations,
like keyboard shortcuts and other tips about the translation tool.

10.7. Translating Offline

Weblate on FreeBSD uses PO gettext files for translations. Users
familiar with PO gettext files that want to translate offline can
download and upload the translations through the document page on
Weblate by clicking in the Files section.

[Weblate Offline]

10.8. Translation based on Automatic Suggestions

Languages using Weblate before the migration to Hugo/Asciidoctor can use
this feature from Weblate to save time.

This feature from Weblate uses the Translation Memory generated by the
other components and projects on the same server. The former Weblate
translations are hosted on the same server as read-only for that.

Strings that match 100/100 in similarity can be copied and saved
directly. Other strings will need at least minor adjustment.

Some examples:

[Weblate Automatic Suggestions 01]

With the migration to Hugo/Asciidoctor, documents use UTF-8. Some HTML
entities should be replaced. Some strings, such as links, require
changes to markup.

[Weblate Automatic Suggestions 02]

Links:

[Weblate Automatic Suggestions 03]

10.9. Proofreading and Weblate Quality Checks

The document dashboard Project/Language/Document shows the translation
status and string status for that document. This page is handy for
proofreading and quality checks.

[Weblate Revision 01]

In this example, two strings are missing the full stop; following that
link will show only those strings to be revised/translated.

[Weblate Revision 02]

Translators and reviewers often value observing translated strings in
context.

10.10. Building the Translated Document

The project does not use continuous integration and continuous delivery
to build translations. There are studies to make it available.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | The following example uses        |
|                                   | GitHub, as Weblate is also on     |
|                                   | GitHub. Note that this repository |
|                                   | is a read-only mirror, but Pull   |
|                                   | Requests are accepted.            |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

To build the translation locally, follow these steps:

Procedure: Clone the necessary repositories

1.  Clone the freebsd-doc repository:

        % git clone https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-doc.git ~/freebsd-doc

2.  Clone the freebsd-doc-translate repository:

        % git clone https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-doc-translate.git ~/freebsd-doc-translate

Procedure: Copy a translation file to freebsd-doc

With both repositories in place, copy the translation from
freebsd-doc-translate to freebsd-doc. Example of the Committerâ€™s Guide
article translation in Spanish.

    % cp ~/freebsd-doc-translate/documentation/content/es/articles/committers-guide/_index.po \
    ~/freebsd-doc/documentation/content/es/articles/committers-guide/

Procedure: Convert a translation file (.po) to .adoc

Go to the root of freebsd-doc.

    % cd ~/freebsd-doc

Translate (convert) the .po file to .adoc

    % ./tools/translate.sh documentation es articles/committers-guide

By default: only files with more than eighty percent of strings
translated will be converted to .adoc.

To ignore that limit:

    % KEEP_ENV=0 ./tools/translate.sh documentation es articles/committers-guide

Some documents, like books, have many PO gettext files. Always copy all
of them when translating and building. Files that werenâ€™t translated
will be converted with the source (English) strings.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | The directory structure is        |
|                                   | fundamental. Always follow the    |
|                                   | English document directory        |
|                                   | structure.                        |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Procedure: Build the translated document

Last, the building part.

Enter the documentation directory because there is no need to build the
FreeBSD website.

    % cd documentation

And build the documentation. Note that en is always added by default
when building any other language.

    % DOC_LANG=es make

This command will build only the English and Spanish documents of the
FreeBSD documentation portal. The output will be in the public
directory; open that in a browser. Note that some index files can
redirect the browser to the online page.

Another good option is to build and serve the content with Hugoâ€™s
internal webserver:

    % DOC_LANG=es make run

By default, the webserver listens on localhost; To override this
behavior, specify the desired IP address in the BIND parameter value.

    % DOC_LANG=es make run BIND=192.168.15.10

This builds and serves the content with Hugoâ€™s internal webserver and
lets it open, and if any file changes, it rebuilds them automatically.

To make any necessary adjustments in the translation, follow the steps
below to re-sync all components:

-   Fix the translation string on Weblate.

-   Force Weblate to commit the changes on Document/Manage/Commit
    section.

-   Sync the local Weblate repository freebsd-doc-translate with a
    git pull origin main command.

-   Copy the translation again to freebsd-doc.

-   Convert the translation to .adoc with the ./tools/translate.sh
    script.

-   Hugo will rebuild the file and not build the entire set if make run
    was used; or re-execute make.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Follow the previous steps as many |
|                                   | times as is necessary until the   |
|                                   | document is ready to be           |
|                                   | published.                        |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

The Documentation Build Process chapter includes information about
rendering to HTML and PDF.

10.11. Submitting Translations

Example of submitting an update to the Brazilian Portuguese article
Committerâ€™s Guide.

Check the repository

After following the steps in Building the Translated Document, go to the
root of freebsd-doc and preview whatâ€™s to be committed. For an overview
of files to be changed, and differences in file content:

    % git status
    % git diff

Review the output, and if any files unrelated to the Committerâ€™s Guide
translation update were changed or added, take the appropriate action of
reverting or removing them, respectively, before proceeding further.

Always include the PO gettext file (.po) and the translated document in
Hugo/Asciidoctor (.adoc).

Create a new branch and commit

Create another branch to separate the work, which will help with future
updates in the local repository.

    % git checkout -b committers-guide_pt-br

Register the local commit.

    % git add .
    % git commit

Example of commit messages for translations:

    pt-br/committers-guide: Sync with en XXXXXXX

Where XXXXXXX is the git(1) revision stored in the Weblate repository
~/freebsd-doc-translate/revision.txt.

If it is the first translation of an article:

    Add Korean translation of Leap Seconds article

A message will be displayed after the commit if git(1) has not been
configured previously. Please follow the instructions and provide the
name and email address used on Weblate. This step is crucial to proper
crediting of contributors.

Then check the entire commit, review changes, and author name and email.

    % git show

Generate a patch

Next, generate a git-format-patch(1) file.

    % git format-patch main
    0001-pt-br-committers-guide-Sync-with-en-XXXXXXX.patch

Attach the patch 0001-pt-br-committers-guide-Sync-with-en-XXXXXXX.patch
to a problem report in FreeBSD Bugzilla.

Include the following information in the report:

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Field                             | Value                             |

| Component                         | Books & Articles                  |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Summary                           | Same as the local commit          |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Description                       | State that instructions in this   |
|                                   | guide were followed, including    |
|                                   | proofreading and other necessary  |
|                                   | steps. Include things that may    |
|                                   | help with triage and progression  |
|                                   | of the report.                    |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| CC (Optional)                     | If the language has coordinators, |
|                                   | include their email addresses in  |
|                                   | the CC field.                     |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

: Table 1. Bugzilla Fields

For people familiar with git(1) and GitHub: instead of submitting the
patch through Bugzilla, a GitHub pull request can be used (use the name
and address that you use with Weblate).

https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-doc/ is a secondary mirror. Changes
to the doc tree can be made only by people who have a doc commit bit.

When translators keep sending good-quality patches, they can be
nominated by other committers to receive write-access (a doc commit bit
for translations), a FreeBSD account, and associated perks.

The list of Additional FreeBSD Contributors includes non-committers
whose contributions are committed to the doc tree.

If in doubt about any procedure, write to the FreeBSD translators
mailing list.

10.12. FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

10.12.1. Is it necessary to translate all the Copyright messages?

Every language team decides this for their language; in pt-br (Brazilian
Portuguese) team, it was decided not to translate those messages.
