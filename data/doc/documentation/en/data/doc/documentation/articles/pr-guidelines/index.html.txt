Problem Report Handling Guidelines

Abstract

These guidelines describe recommended handling practices for FreeBSD
Problem Reports (PRs). Whilst developed for the FreeBSD PR Database
Maintenance Team freebsd-bugbusters@FreeBSD.org, these guidelines should
be followed by anyone working with FreeBSD PRs.

1. Introduction

Bugzilla is an issue management system used by the FreeBSD Project. As
accurate tracking of outstanding software defects is important to
FreeBSD’s quality, the correct use of the software is essential to the
forward progress of the Project.

Access to Bugzilla is available to the entire FreeBSD community. In
order to maintain consistency within the database and provide a
consistent user experience, guidelines have been established covering
common aspects of bug management such as presenting followup, handling
close requests, and so forth.

2. Problem Report Life-cycle

-   The Reporter submits a bug report on the website. The bug is in the
    Needs Triage state.

-   Jane Random BugBuster confirms that the bug report has sufficient
    information to be reproducible. If not, she goes back and forth with
    the reporter to obtain the needed information. At this point the bug
    is set to the Open state.

-   Joe Random Committer takes interest in the PR and assigns it to
    himself, or Jane Random BugBuster decides that Joe is best suited to
    handle it and assigns it to him. The bug should be set to the
    In Discussion state.

-   Joe has a brief exchange with the originator (making sure it all
    goes into the audit trail) and determines the cause of the problem.

-   Joe pulls an all-nighter and whips up a patch that he thinks fixes
    the problem, and submits it in a follow-up, asking the originator to
    test it. He then sets the PRs state to Patch Ready.

-   A couple of iterations later, both Joe and the originator are
    satisfied with the patch, and Joe commits it to -CURRENT (or
    directly to -STABLE if the problem does not exist in -CURRENT),
    making sure to reference the Problem Report in his commit log (and
    credit the originator if they submitted all or part of the patch)
    and, if appropriate, start an MFC countdown. The bug is set to the
    Needs MFC state.

-   If the patch does not need MFCing, Joe then closes the PR as
    Issue Resolved.

|                                   | little information about the      |
|                                   | problem, and some are either very |
|                                   | complex to solve, or just scratch |
|                                   | the surface of a larger problem;  |
|                                   | in these cases, it is very        |
|                                   | important to obtain all the       |
|                                   | necessary information needed to   |
|                                   | solve the problem. If the problem |
|                                   | contained within cannot be        |
|                                   | solved, or has occurred again, it |
|                                   | is necessary to re-open the PR.   |

3. Problem Report State

It is important to update the state of a PR when certain actions are
taken. The state should accurately reflect the current state of work on
the PR.

Example 1. A small example on when to change PR state

When a PR has been worked on and the developer(s) responsible feel
comfortable about the fix, they will submit a followup to the PR and
change its state to "feedback". At this point, the originator should
evaluate the fix in their context and respond indicating whether the
defect has indeed been remedied.

A Problem Report may be in one of the following states:

open

    Initial state; the problem has been pointed out and it needs
    reviewing.

analyzed

    The problem has been reviewed and a solution is being sought.

feedback

    Further work requires additional information from the originator or
    the community; possibly information regarding the proposed solution.

patched

    A patch has been committed, but something (MFC, or maybe
    confirmation from originator) is still pending.

suspended

    The problem is not being worked on, due to lack of information or
    resources. This is a prime candidate for somebody who is looking for
    a project to take on. If the problem cannot be solved at all, it
    will be closed, rather than suspended. The documentation project
    uses suspended for wish-list items that entail a significant amount
    of work which no one currently has time for.

closed

    A problem report is closed when any changes have been integrated,
    documented, and tested, or when fixing the problem is abandoned.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | The "patched" state is directly   |
|                                   | related to feedback, so you may   |
|                                   | go directly to "closed" state if  |
|                                   | the originator cannot test the    |
|                                   | patch, and it works in your own   |
|                                   | testing.                          |

4. Types of Problem Reports

While handling problem reports, either as a developer who has direct
access to the Problem Reports database or as a contributor who browses
the database and submits followups with patches, comments, suggestions
or change requests, you will come across several different types of PRs.

-   Unassigned PRs

-   Assigned PRs

-   Duplicate PRs

-   Stale PRs

-   Non-Bug PRs

The following sections describe what each different type of PRs is used
for, when a PR belongs to one of these types, and what treatment each
different type receives.

5. Unassigned PRs

When PRs arrive, they are initially assigned to a generic (placeholder)
assignee. These are always prepended with freebsd-. The exact value for
this default depends on the category; in most cases, it corresponds to a
specific FreeBSD mailing list. Here is the current list, with the most
common ones listed first:

: Table 2. Default Assignees - other

Do not be surprised to find that the submitter of the PR has assigned it
to the wrong category. If you fix the category, do not forget to fix the
assignment as well. (In particular, our submitters seem to have a hard
time understanding that just because their problem manifested on an i386
system, that it might be generic to all of FreeBSD, and thus be more
appropriate for kern. The converse is also true, of course.)

Certain PRs may be reassigned away from these generic assignees by
anyone. There are several types of assignees: specialized mailing lists;
mail aliases (used for certain limited-interest items); and individuals.

For assignees which are mailing lists, please use the long form when
making the assignment (e.g., freebsd-foo instead of foo); this will
avoid duplicate emails sent to the mailing list.

: Table 4. Common Assignees - Ports Collection

Ports PRs which have a maintainer who is a ports committer may be
reassigned by anyone (but note that not every FreeBSD committer is
necessarily a ports committer, so you cannot simply go by the email
address alone.)

For other PRs, please do not reassign them to individuals (other than
yourself) unless you are certain that the assignee really wants to track
the PR. This will help to avoid the case where no one looks at fixing a
particular problem because everyone assumes that the assignee is already
working on it.

: Table 5. Common Assignees - Other

6. Assigned PRs

If a PR has the responsible field set to the username of a FreeBSD
developer, it means that the PR has been handed over to that particular
person for further work.

Assigned PRs should not be touched by anyone but the assignee or
bugmeister. If you have comments, submit a followup. If for some reason
you think the PR should change state or be reassigned, send a message to
the assignee. If the assignee does not respond within two weeks,
unassign the PR and do as you please.

7. Duplicate PRs

If you find more than one PR that describe the same issue, choose the
one that contains the largest amount of useful information and close the
others, stating clearly the number of the superseding PR. If several PRs
contain non-overlapping useful information, submit all the missing
information to one in a followup, including references to the others;
then close the other PRs (which are now completely superseded).

8. Stale PRs

A PR is considered stale if it has not been modified in more than six
months. Apply the following procedure to deal with stale PRs:

-   If the PR contains sufficient detail, try to reproduce the problem
    in -CURRENT and -STABLE. If you succeed, submit a followup detailing
    your findings and try to find someone to assign it to. Set the state
    to "analyzed" if appropriate.

-   If the PR describes an issue which you know is the result of a usage
    error (incorrect configuration or otherwise), submit a followup
    explaining what the originator did wrong, then close the PR with the
    reason "User error" or "Configuration error".

-   If the PR describes an error which you know has been corrected in
    both -CURRENT and -STABLE, close it with a message stating when it
    was fixed in each branch.

-   If the PR describes an error which you know has been corrected in
    -CURRENT, but not in -STABLE, try to find out when the person who
    corrected it is planning to MFC it, or try to find someone else
    (maybe yourself?) to do it. Set the state to "patched" and assign it
    to whomever will do the MFC.

-   In other cases, ask the originator to confirm if the problem still
    exists in newer versions. If the originator does not reply within a
    month, close the PR with the notation "Feedback timeout".

9. Non-Bug PRs

Developers that come across PRs that look like they should have been
posted to FreeBSD problem reports mailing list or some other list should
close the PR, informing the submitter in a comment why this is not
really a PR and where the message should be posted.

The email addresses that Bugzilla listens to for incoming PRs have been
published as part of the FreeBSD documentation, have been announced and
listed on the web-site. This means that spammers found them.

Whenever you close one of these PRs, please do the following:

-   Set the component to junk (under Supporting Services.

-   Set Responsible to nobody@FreeBSD.org.

-   Set State to Issue Resolved.

Setting the category to junk makes it obvious that there is no useful
content within the PR, and helps to reduce the clutter within the main
categories.
