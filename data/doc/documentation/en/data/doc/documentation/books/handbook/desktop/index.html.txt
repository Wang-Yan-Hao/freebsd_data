Chapter 8. Desktop Environments

8.1. Synopsis

While FreeBSD is popular as a server for its performance and stability,
it is also well suited for day-to-day use as a desktop. With over 36000
applications available in the FreeBSD ports tree, it is straightforward
to build a customized desktop that can run a wide variety of desktop
applications. This chapter demonstrates how to install popular desktop
environments as well as desktop applications such as web browsers,
productivity software, document viewers, and financial software.

Prerequisites:

-   Readers of this chapter should already understand how to install
    either the X Window System or Wayland on FreeBSD.

-   Readers are instructed throughout this chapter to install official
    packages. Refer to the section on using the ports collection to
    build customized packages from ports.

8.2. Desktop Environments

This section describes how to install and configure some popular desktop
environments on a FreeBSD system. A desktop environment can range from a
simple window manager to a complete suite of desktop applications.
