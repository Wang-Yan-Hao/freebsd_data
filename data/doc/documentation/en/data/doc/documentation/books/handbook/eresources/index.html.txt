Appendix C. Resources on the Internet

The rapid pace of FreeBSD progress makes print media impractical as a
means of following the latest developments. Electronic resources are the
best, if not often the only, way to stay informed of the latest
advances. Since FreeBSD is a volunteer effort, the user community itself
also generally serves as a "technical support department" of sorts, with
electronic mail, web forums, and USENET news being the most effective
way of reaching that community.

The most important points of contact with the FreeBSD user community are
outlined below. There is a possibly more up to date list on the
community portal on the FreeBSD Wiki. Please send other resources not
mentioned here to the FreeBSD documentation project mailing list so that
they may also be included.

C.1. Websites

-   The FreeBSD Forums provide a web based discussion forum for FreeBSD
    questions and technical discussion.

-   The FreeBSD Wiki provides various bits of information that hadn’t
    yet made it into the Handbook.

-   The FreeBSD Documentation website doesn’t provide just the Users’s
    Handbook; there are other handbooks and articles that are worth a
    read.

-   The FreeBSD Journal is a free, professionally-edited, bi-monthly
    technical magazine released by FreeBSD Foundation.

-   The BSDConferences YouTube Channel provides a collection of high
    quality videos from BSD conferences around the world. This is a
    great way to watch key developers give presentations about new work
    in FreeBSD.

-   FreeBSD Status Reports are released every three months and track
    progress of FreeBSD development.

-   There’s a FreeBSD-focused Reddit group at r/freebsd.

-   Super User and Server Fault, the Stack Exchange services for system
    administrators.

-   FreeBSD Discord server, a communications and community-building
    service, where FreeBSD community members can socialise, obtain
    support or support others, learn, contribute, collaborate, and stay
    up to date with all things FreeBSD-related.

-   IRC channels, a widely implemented, technically mature, open
    standard text chat.

C.2. Mailing Lists

The mailing lists are the most direct way of addressing questions or
opening a technical discussion to a concentrated FreeBSD audience. There
are a wide variety of lists on a number of different FreeBSD topics.
Sending questions to the most appropriate mailing list will invariably
assure a faster and more accurate response.

|                                   | To test the ability to send email |
|                                   | to FreeBSD lists, send a test     |
|                                   | message to FreeBSD test mailing   |
|                                   | list. Please do not send test     |
|                                   | messages to any other list.       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

When in doubt about what list to post a question to, see How to get best
results from the FreeBSD-questions mailing list.

Before posting to any list, please:

-   learn about how to best use the mailing lists, such as how to help
    avoid frequently-repeated discussions, by reading the Mailing List
    Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document

-   search the archives, to tell whether someone else has already posted
    what you intend to post.

Archive search interfaces include:

-   https://www.freebsd.org/search/ (DuckDuckGo)

-   https://lists.freebsd.org/search (Experimental search engine)

Note that this also means that messages sent to FreeBSD mailing lists
are archived in perpetuity. When protecting privacy is a concern,
consider using a disposable secondary email address and posting only
public information.

FreeBSD-provided archives:

-   do not present links as links

-   do not present inline images

-   do not present HTML content of HTML messages.

The FreeBSD public mailing lists can be consulted here.

C.2.1. How to Subscribe

To subscribe to a list, click the list name at
https://lists.freebsd.org. The page that is displayed should contain all
of the necessary subscription instructions for that list.

To actually post to a given list, send mail to listname@FreeBSD.org. It
will then be redistributed to mailing list members world-wide.

To unsubscribe from a list, click on the URL found at the bottom of
every email received from the list. It is also possible to send an email
to listname+unsubscribe@FreeBSD.org to unsubscribe.

It is important to keep discussion in the technical mailing lists on a
technical track. To only receive important announcements, instead join
the FreeBSD announcements mailing list, which is intended for infrequent
traffic.

C.2.2. Lists Basic Rules

All FreeBSD mailing lists have certain basic rules which must be adhered
to by anyone using them. Failure to comply with these guidelines will
result in two (2) written warnings from the FreeBSD Postmaster
postmaster@FreeBSD.org, after which, on a third offense, the poster will
removed from all FreeBSD mailing lists and filtered from further posting
to them. We regret that such rules and measures are necessary at all,
but today’s Internet is a pretty harsh environment, it would seem, and
many fail to appreciate just how fragile some of its mechanisms are.

Rules of the road:

-   The topic of any posting should adhere to the basic description of
    the list it is posted to. If the list is about technical issues, the
    posting should contain technical discussion. Ongoing irrelevant
    chatter or flaming only detracts from the value of the mailing list
    for everyone on it and will not be tolerated. For free-form
    discussion on no particular topic, the FreeBSD chat mailing list is
    freely available and should be used instead.

-   No posting should be made to more than 2 mailing lists, and only to
    2 when a clear and obvious need to post to both lists exists. For
    most lists, there is already a great deal of subscriber overlap and
    except for the most esoteric mixes (say "-stable & -scsi"), there
    really is no reason to post to more than one list at a time. If a
    message is received with multiple mailing lists on the Cc line, trim
    the Cc line before replying. The person who replies is still
    responsible for cross-posting, no matter who the originator might
    have been.

-   Personal attacks and profanity (in the context of an argument) are
    not allowed, and that includes users and developers alike. Gross
    breaches of netiquette, like excerpting or reposting private mail
    when permission to do so was not and would not be forthcoming, are
    frowned upon but not specifically enforced.

-   Advertising of non-FreeBSD related products or services is strictly
    prohibited and will result in an immediate ban if it is clear that
    the offender is advertising by spam.

C.2.3. Filtering on the Mailing Lists

The FreeBSD mailing lists are filtered in multiple ways to avoid the
distribution of spam, viruses, and other unwanted emails. The filtering
actions described in this section do not include all those used to
protect the mailing lists.

Only certain types of attachments are allowed on the mailing lists. All
attachments with a MIME content type not found in the list below will be
stripped before an email is distributed on the mailing lists.

-   application/octet-stream

-   application/pdf

-   application/pgp-signature

-   application/x-pkcs7-signature

-   message/rfc822

-   multipart/alternative

-   multipart/related

-   multipart/signed

-   text/html

-   text/plain

-   text/x-diff

-   text/x-patch

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|                                   | Some of the mailing lists might   |
|                                   | allow attachments of other MIME   |
|                                   | content types, but the above list |
|                                   | should be applicable for most of  |
|                                   | the mailing lists.                |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

If an email contains both an HTML and a plain text version, the HTML
version will be removed. If an email contains only an HTML version, it
will be converted to plain text.
