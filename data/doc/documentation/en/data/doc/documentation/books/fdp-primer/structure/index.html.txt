Chapter 4. Documentation Directory Structure

Files and directories in the doc/ tree follow a structure meant to:

1.  Make it easy to automate converting the document to other formats.

2.  Promote consistency between the different documentation
    organizations, to make it easier to switch between working on
    different documents.

3.  Make it easy to decide where in the tree new documentation should be
    placed.

In addition, the documentation tree must accommodate documents in many
different languages. It is important that the documentation tree
structure does not enforce any particular defaults or cultural
preferences.

4.1. The Top Level, doc/

There are three sections under doc/, documentation and website share the
same structure.

+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| Directory   | Usage                                                  |
+=============+========================================================+
| do          | Contains all the articles and books in AsciiDoc        |
| cumentation | format. Contains subdirectories to further categorize  |
|             | the information by languages.                          |
+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| tools       | Contains a set of tools used to translate the          |
|             | documentation and the website using Weblate. The       |
|             | Weblate instance can be found here.                    |
+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| shared      | Contains files that are not specific to the various    |
|             | translations of the documentation. Contains            |
|             | subdirectories to further categorize the information   |
|             | by languages and three files to store the authors,     |
|             | releases and mirrors information. This directory is    |
|             | shared between documentation and the website.          |
+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| website     | Contains the FreeBSD website in AsciiDoc format.       |
|             | Contains subdirectories to further categorize the      |
|             | information by languages.                              |
+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------+

4.2. The Directories

These directories contain the documentation and the website. The
documentation is organized into subdirectories below this level,
following the Hugo directory structure.

+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| Directory   | Usage                                                  |
+=============+========================================================+
| archetypes  | Contain templates to create new articles, books and    |
|             | webpages. For more information take a look here.       |
+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| config      | Contain the Hugo configuration files. One main file    |
|             | and one file per language. For more information take a |
|             | look here.                                             |
+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| content     | Contain the books, articles and webpages. One          |
|             | directory exists for each available translation of the |
|             | documentation, for example en and zh-tw.               |
+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| data        | Contain custom data for build the website in TOML      |
|             | format. This directory is used to store the events,    |
|             | news, press, etc. For more information take a look     |
|             | here.                                                  |

|             | For example to generate the Table of Contents of the   |
|             | books, etc.                                            |

+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------+

4.3. Document-Specific Information

This section contains specific notes about particular documents managed
by the FDP.

4.4. The Books: books/

The books are written in AsciiDoc.

For each FreeBSD book, the AsciiDoc document type (aka doctype) is book.
Books have parts, each of which contains several chapters.

When the document is converted to HTML 5 (using the built-in html5
backend):

-   AsciiDoc section level 0 (=) at the beginning of a chapter of a book
    will be <h1>

-   AsciiDoc section level 1 (==) must be used for the first logical
    section of a chapter, and will be <h2>

-   AsciiDoc section level 2 (===) must be used for the first logical
    subsection, and will be <h3>

– and so on. Reference: Section Titles and Levels | Asciidoctor Docs.

4.4.1. Physical Organization

There are a number of files and directories within the books directory,
all with the same structure.

4.4.1.1. _index.adoc

The _index.adoc file defines some AsciiDoc variables that affect how the
AsciiDoc source is converted to other formats and list the Table of
Contents, Table of Examples, Table of Figures, Table of Tables and the
abstract section.

4.4.1.2. book.adoc

The book.adoc file defines some AsciiDoc variables that affect how the
AsciiDoc source is converted to other formats and list the Table of
Contents, Table of Examples, Table of Figures, Table of Tables, the
abstract section and all the chapters. This file is used to generate the
PDF with asciidoctor-pdf and to generate the book in one html page.

4.4.1.3. part*.adoc

The part*.adoc files store a brief introduction of one part of the book.

4.4.1.4. directory/_index.adoc

Each chapter in the Handbook is stored in a file called _index.adoc in a
separate directory from the other chapters.

For example, this is an example of the header of one chapter:

    ---
    title: Chapter 8. Configuring the FreeBSD Kernel
    part: Part II. Common Tasks
    prev: books/handbook/multimedia
    next: books/handbook/printing
    ---

    [[kernelconfig]]
    = Configuring the FreeBSD Kernel
    ...

When the HTML5 version of the Handbook is produced, this will yield
kernelconfig/index.html.

A brief look will show that there are many directories with individual
_index.adoc files, including basics/_index.adoc,
introduction/_index.adoc, and printing/_index.adoc.

|                                   | directories after their ordering  |
|                                   | within the Handbook. This         |
|                                   | ordering can change as the        |
|                                   | content within the Handbook is    |
|                                   | reorganized. Reorganization       |
|                                   | should be possible without        |
|                                   | renaming files, unless entire     |
|                                   | chapters are being promoted or    |
|                                   | demoted within the hierarchy.     |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

4.5. The Articles: articles/

The articles are written in AsciiDoc.

The articles are organized as an AsciiDoc article. The articles are
divided into sections (=) and subsections (==, ===) and so on.

4.5.1. Physical Organization

There is one _index.adoc file per article.

4.5.1.1. _index.adoc

The _index.adoc file contains all the AsciiDoc variables and the
content.

For example, this is an example of one article, the structure is pretty
similar to one book chapter:

    ---
